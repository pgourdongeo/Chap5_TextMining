"1. Introduction: paradigm shift is in the air…  
At the end of 2015 and in the beginning of 2016, when the CHANGE! action planning network under the URBACT III Programme (www.urbact.eu) was set up and its thematic focus was fi ne-tuned, people in Europe and worldwide were paying special attention to some big issues. Undoubtedly, the biggest of these issues is climate change. With that regard, the biggest challenge is whether we, human beings are ready to integrate concepts of environmental limits into our everyday life and efficiently reduce our (every person) ecological footprint in a short time. In this way we may have a chance to safeguard the environment for future generations, and Europe, as the most urbanised continent, has a higher responsibility to be exemplary. The question is, whether the climate deal made in Paris on 12 December, 2015, was “a historic event that marked the moment when the human race finally got serious about the fight against climate change, or just a United Nations therapy session whose main role was to make us feel better about our headlong plunge toward climate catastrophe 1”. The importance of the agreement is hard to overemphasize, especially as nobody had expected this successful outcome before. This is the first time in our history, when virtually every nation in the world made voluntary commitments to cut carbon pollution and help vulnerable countries deal with the impacts of climate change. But of course details are essential, and most probably it will be some years before we can say whether the Paris Climate Deal was successful or not. It is not only in the environmental sphere that we see radical thinking and a willingness to make big changes. More and more people are ready to rethink the whole system related to social issues as well. Looking around in Europe, we can realise in one hand that some cities have already started radical experiments. The four Dutch cities, Tilburg, Utrecht, Groningen and Wageningen, since January, 2016 are giving some of their social assistance receivers an unconditional social security payment (i.e. a monthly income of the Government without an obligation to take paid employment or to be involved in community service). They examine whether these people will become more active than others with the current, strict regime. Although these cities do not use Basic Income, their pilot is rather close to this phenomenon. According to basicincome.org a basic income is “an income unconditionally granted to all on an individual basis, without means test or work requirement. It is a form of minimum income guarantee that differs from those that now exist in various European countries in three important ways: • it is being paid to individuals rather than households; • it is paid irrespective of any income from other sources; • it is paid without requiring the performance of any work or the willingness to accept a job if offered. 2 ” Dutch cities are not isolated with exploring new ways. From France to Switzerland, and from Canada to Finland, many countries put this issue high on the political agenda. For instance,”after committing itself to conducting a basic income pilot in Finland the Finnish government is putting words into action. The new government of Finland announced in September, 2015 the allocation of a grant to a group of researchers from the Finnish social security and pension department. This working group is now in charge of designing parameters for the pilot project, which should be delivered by 2016”. 3 On the other hand, some strong bottom-up movements to ‘claim the city back’ were born in the last months or years (e.g. Cities of Commons in Italy4, synAthina5 in Greece). Closer to the focus of the CHANGE! network, which is the reform of the Welfare State, we can also witness historical steps taken. In many parts of Europe people are talking about the reorganisation of the Welfare State and piloting how the new service delivery should look. The WeEindhoven6 programme running in the whole territory of Eindhoven is one of the most advanced models with this regard, while in the UK the government has already created a national level legislation to provide framework for community-led, collaborated public services (Localism Act 7). Finally, it is worth mentioning that the grand prize of the Bloomberg Philanthropies’ European Mayors Challenge went to Barcelona8, where they are developing a city level platform to support senior citizens, and thus to better cope with one of the most burning societal challenges, the ageing society. It seems that an increasing number of people consider the crisis of our days as an opportunity to do something different, something extraordinary. Indeed there is an inevitable need for a paradigm shift, and we can all be happy to see that in some cases top-down structures, which are usually not efficient and unable to move forward, have found ways to support bottom-up initiatives (regarding how a local government can unlock the collaborative capacity, see the case of another Dutch city Amersfoort in the URBACT Capitalisation Paper 2015 - Social Innovation in Cities9). Hopefully these first attempts can act as points for ‘urban acupuncture’ (quoted from Jaime Lerner, the former Mayor of Curitiba, Brazil), meaning that these smaller or in some cases already upscaled symbolic projects can have an effect in creating points of energy and initiating a snowball effect in whole Europe, transforming the larger urban context in Europe. Paradigm shift is important for the CHANGE! network, an action planning network, financed by the EU within the URBACT III Programme. Generally speaking, we tend to be more enthusiastic in the beginning of the implementation of EU projects, but in this case we can definitely state that the CHANGE! network fits extremely well to the recent socio-economic trends in Europe and thus has a huge potential to influence and change local social policies of its partner cities. The CHANGE! network provides exchange and learning activities for a number of cities coming from different corners of Europe, to co-produce action plans with local stakeholders about how to transform (re-design) existing social services towards a more collaborative provision, towards a people-powered service delivery. CHANGE!’s main goal is to identify different parameters and model different pathways for culturally different cities enabling them to move forward towards a collaborative public service provision, and to public service reform. The learning process will be extremely interesting in this network, as its innovative topic is quite novel on the European level, and almost completely untouched in many countries in Europe in terms of legislation despite the fact that the same challenges apply everywhere. If it will be realistic in two years’ time, the main outcome of the network will be the establishment of a European movement of cities supporting the shift towards a more collaborative service provision or even more specific, towards people-powered public services. By drawing up briefly the most important European trends and policies related to public service reform and people-powered public services, this state-of-the-art aims to motivate partner cities to become change agents or change makers, and provides a learning opportunity for any European city to join this accelerating running historical moment. 
6. A framework for people-powered social services 
6.1. Why focus on people-powered public services? 
The literature often uses ‘social action’ as synonym of people-powered public services. Whatever terminology is used, these expressions refer to various activities undertaken voluntarily to benefit others (from small and often informal acts of being kind with our neighbours, through one–off volunteering in a time of crisis or in response to a specific request, to formal, regular volunteering). The key question is how to mobilise people through volunteering in and alongside public services, how their effort could be embedded in public services to make them more collaborative and efficient. There are several reasons why the whole society can benefit by organising social action or people-powered public services in and alongside public services. NESTA’ Centre for Social Action Innovation Fund highlights the below five points (Emma Clarence, Madeleine Gabriel, 2014). • Social action increases the resources available to achieve social goals. • Social actions give public services access to new expertise and knowledge. • It reaches people and places that public services cannot reach. • It leads to a fundamental change in the way we respond to social needs and challenges. • Social action can create better services and reciprocal value for the people who give their time. 
6.2. Focus of the CHANGE! network 
The CHANGE! network focuses on the below principles: • Co-designing (social design) social services towards a more collaborative service provision by fostering relationships among citizens within their local social networks (people-powered social services). This often means creating an urban strategy/policy which engages volunteers to improve communities and reduce costs of public services at the same time (similar to the aim of Cities of Service movement). • As such a complex change in social services cannot be reached, nor analysed separately, other open government themes (open data, open decisions, participation, transparency, collaboration in other public services) mean preconditions for CHANGE! partners (as preconditions for collaborative public services). • CHANGE! ULGs will co-identify different cultural and socio-economic parameters and, based on these, model different pathways helping them to move forward towards a more collaborative public service provision. The ULG work provides opportunity to go through the below collaborative framework and do a self assessment regarding each stage of the Social Innovation Spiral/Collaborative Framework. • Since the legislation of social services varies from country to country, each CHANGE! partner should focus locally on that activity which can provide an urban acupuncture effect regarding social innovation in social services. 
6.3. Good practices related to people-powered public services 
The fact that even in the most innovative cities public services are yet not designed to make the mobilisation of citizens in a more central position of the delivery proves that citizen engagement in public services is far from its potentials. Yet in Eindhoven, where the radically new system delivery is based on the theory of people-powered public services, some powerful tools such as peer support are not widely used. Therefore it is essential to see some concrete examples how the social action might lead to preventive welfare and how it can be embedded into public services in a wider extent. • Peer support type of activities: help provided by volunteers and especially peers - alongside with professional help or alone - can be powerful in connection with many groups of the society (e.g. elderly, youth, families, people with specific health problems, drug users). Facilitating peers to share knowledge is an efficient way to make public services more collaborative. This method is widely used in active ageing measures, but less popular in connection with other groups. From the practice of CHANGE! partners, the Social Health initiative from Aarhus is such a - still not systematised – method. NESTA provides many good examples with regard to youth (Access Project, Code Club) and families (Home-Start, Family by Family, Family Group Conference) (see more: Emma Clarence, Madeleine Gabriel, 2014). • Befriending Schemes: e.g. Diabetes Friends and Dementia Friends (see more: Emma Clarence, Madeleine Gabriel, 2014). Actually these are real peer-support initiatives, activating relatively small volunteering efforts on the individual level, but the impact on the society can be significant. • The power of new relationships that boost social action (“unlikely connections for social action” as the Unusual Suspects Festival slogan expresses it): it is about facilitating the encounters of those groups they rarely meet each other otherwise. As for CHANGE! partners, Aarhus provides an example with its Dumpster Diving Café project. Some inspiring cases NESTA highlights: Shared Lives, GoodGym. Some cities in Europe also experienced to facilitate isolated elderly with young students seeking for accommodation. • In museums and libraries, for example, a number of different models are emerging, from bringing volunteers in to support the roles of paid staff to transferring services to the community to run. Also, as the case of the King’s College Hospital highlighted (see more: Emma Clarence, Madeleine Gabriel, 2014), using volunteers in a professional way, can take efficiency in the operation and higher satisfaction of users at the same time. • Establishment of volunteering movements (e.g. Encore movement – encore.org, which advocates for people in the second half of life to find ‘passion and purpose’ through social action, City Year, which provides a year-long volunteering activities for students in social actions). • Members of the Cities of Service movement engage citizens to create real and measurable impact in their own communities. Citizen volunteers work to lower school drop-out rates, improve energy efficiency in homes, revitalise neighbourhoods, and more. Coalition cities develop a comprehensive service plan and a coordinated strategy focused on matching volunteers and established community partners to the areas of greatest local need. Additionally, coalition cities use specific metrics for each service initiative to measure outcomes and impact, allowing Cities of Service and its member cities to learn where successes and challenges exist, and improve initiatives for future implementation. • Personal budgeting is also a radical way how to transform services more personal. It may apply for adult social care, health care or unemployment benefits for example, for those with long-term conditions and complex needs, recognising that these people need more flexibility and autonomy over the services they receive. • Citizen budgets (participatory budgets) are great and by now rather well-known tools to activate citizen engagement and share responsibility. • Time-banks, time credit systems or in more general Local Exchange and Trading Systems (e.g. SPICE Time Credit – www.justaddspice.org) are great tools to mobilise volunteering actions and community engagement. The more general context regarding this theme is how social action can be recognised and valued publicly (tax reduction, receptions for volunteers, awarding, or even using alternative currencies to accelerate cultural change). • Using the power of reciprocity through regulation (“public services could be making small asks of people who have benefited, improving outcomes for other service users” – for instance jobseekers should provide – based on a contract created before using the service - peer support for active job seekers). • There are plenty of local initiatives aiming to get the right back to the city (e.g. Cities of Commons in Italy, SynAthina in Greece). Although many of these movements are formulated around cultural issues or temporally use (Power of Dirt is a good practice from the US at this point), the main issue here is how to create conditions where social action can happen, how to formally mobilise citizens and empower neighbourhoods to help each other in and alongside public services. 
18. Synthesis: concept for learning within CHANGE! 
The nine partner cities of the ‘CHANGE! – social design of public services’ network have a common vision to  transform their public services (with a special emphasis on social services) towards a more collaborative service  provision by boosting local social networks and harnessing the power of relationships among citizens (people- powered social services). If they are successful, a local shift towards a more collaborative public service model will result in more efficient and less expensive public service delivery, and it also will increase social capital and social inclusion within the local society. By doing so, CHANGE! cities and their URBACT Local Groups (ULG)  will act according to the following key principles: Co-designing social services towards a more collaborative service provision by fostering relationships  among citizens often means creating an urban strategy/policy which engages volunteers in or alongside  public services. A complex change in social services can neither be reached, nor analysed separately, as other open government themes (open data, open decision-making, participation, transparency, collaboration in other public services) mean preconditions for CHANGE! cities (as preconditions for collaborative  public services). Discussing these topics cannot be avoided on the local level, yet they are not the focus of exchange and learning activities. CHANGE! ULGs will co-identify different cultural and socio-economic parameters and, based on these, model different pathways helping them to move forward towards a more collaborative public service provision. The knowledge gained within CHANGE! should tackle an existing, ongoing issue. During the ULG work and action planning the focus shall be on some concrete, realistic initiatives (e.g.  building up peer support schemes), which might provide a quick-win (urban acupuncture), and which  can be supported by empowering capacity building actions. Both transnational exchange/learning activities and ULG work will be based on the Collaborative Framework and the Social Innovation Spiral. These models provide excellent opportunity for peer- reviews within transnational meetings and for self-assessment during planning actions as well. Since the legislation of social services varies from country to country, each CHANGE! partner should  focus locally on that activity which can provide an urban acupuncture effect regarding social innovation  in social services.  During the city visits each partner defined learning needs, experiences and practices to be shared, as well as needs in terms of capacity building. Later on, within a matchmaking exercise (speed dating workshop during Phase 1 final event) partners fine-tuned their “wishes” and also specified the focus of their Integrated Action  Plan. The results of this exercise, as well as the partner profiles are summarised below. The below summary  helps partners to create clear ‘thematic bridges’ among them, and also to the LP/LE to focus better the topics to  be explored during exchange and learning activities. These links will energise and also coordinate the learning process both locally and on transnational level.  1.  Learning needs of partner cities. 2.

"1. The City Centre Doctor Project and the URBACT Programme  
The City Centre Doctor Project is an Action Planning Network co funded by the URBACT III Programme, a European Union territorial cooperation programme helping cities to pursue sustainable integrated urban development.  The City Centre Doctor Project is a partnership of ten smaller cities in ten European countries that are located in proximity to larger cities. See the map below. The aim of the Project is for the partner cities to develop collaboration mechanisms and integrated action plans that will drive revitalisation of their city centres. A – Naas (Ireland) F – Valašské Mezirící (Czech Republic)  B – Medina del Campo (Spain) G – Petrinja (Croatia)  C – San Doná di Piave (Italy) H – Heerlen (Netherlands)  D – Radlin (Poland) I – Nort sur Erdre (France)  E – Idrija (Slovenia) J – Amarante (Portugal) Project partners value the importance of the city centres as drivers of economic activity. These centres are not only places to work, shop and access services, but it is also the places where people spend free time and build up emotional connections with their city. Hence the popular perspective that the city centre is the ‘heart’ of the city.  The partner cities derive benefits from being part of the economic functional area dominated by the larger city, but at the same time are challenged to compete for the custom of their residents and to attract footfall and business to their respective city centres.  The Project is an opportunity for each partner city to harness the passion and interest of local stakeholders to work together, discuss, consult and design actions that will bring the kind of improvements to their city centres that will attract footfall and thus be a driver for new business formation and business growth and ultimately for job creation. The key challenges for the city centres to survive and indeed thrive are discussed in this State of the Art paper. After familiarisation visits to each partner city, the following five questions were deemed most relevant for developing themes or topics for further discussion in project network exchanges and at ULG level: What are the drivers of a local economy which can be influenced to stimulate new business development and growth in the city centre? How do we deal with traffic congestion and the other factors that put people off to come into the city centre? What can we do to make our city smart and what can technology do for our city centre? What can we do to make our city centre more attractive and a nice experience for people? How do we keep young people in our city and in particular how can we get young people to ‘hang out’, live and work in the city centre? 
2. Who is your city centre?  
The Harvard economist Ed Glaeser (2011) gives the following harsh definition of a city1:  Cities are the absence of physical space between people and companies. They are proximity, density, closeness. They enable us to work and play together, and their success depends on the demand for physical connection.  At the heart of cities are their city centres. A city centre however is more than a concentration of buildings in crammed spaces with lots of cars, people and businesses. In many cases it is the engine room for the local economy. It follows from Glaeser’s thinking, which is the conventional view, that the more concentrated the resources and inputs in the centre, the higher potential for economic growth (the main aim for all economists). Examples are city centres or downtowns of New York, Shanghai, Hong Kong or Tokyo.  Skyscrapers alone however will not guarantee a well functioning city centre. It is the last part of Glaeser’s definition that is the most powerful: Success depends on the demand for physical connection. It is more than the demand for people seeking to connect face to face. It should also be considered as aggregate demand for all the transactions, wiring, flows and memes2 that underpin economic, social and cultural activity in a city centre. If the assumption holds, then stimulating and increasing demand for physical connection will lead to well functioning city centres, because there will be incentives to invest on the supply side, i.e. infrastructure, facilities, new technology, aesthetics, art etc.  In the City Centre Doctor Project, the opportunity exists for 10 cities to work together to examine the physical connections in their city centres and to experiment and plan actions to stimulate and respond to the demand for physical connection.  The connectivity of people, things, spaces and buildings are to be further explored in the Project. Danish architect Jan Gehl proposes a framework for connectivity3 based on: A lively city – a city with a focus on the importance of life in the public spaces, in particular social and cultural opportunities. A safe city – a city with a cohesive structure that offers short distances between destinations and a variation of urban functions? A sustainable and healthy city – a city where a large part of the population walks. Gehl does not emphasise the role of technology, though his vision of a walkable cohesive city and city centre is also a canvas for the connectivity that technology can provide.  Imagine a compact walkable city centre covered by fibre broad band and WiFi where residents and visitors are able to navigate their way using apps; have real time information on a range of services and products; can click and collect from anywhere in the world at any time; work in co working spaces and meet with colleagues and clients in cool and creative city places; have smart buildings and appliances that save energy and increase comfort; and where the impact on the environment is monitored and minimised. Such a city centre is in the making. Bruce Katz and Jennifer Bradley (2013) of the Brookings Institution recognise that economic growth and wellbeing will be significantly influenced by the place preferences of people and firms4. They predict that certain places and in particular city centres with clusters of talent, technology and a reputation for creativity will become ‘innovation districts’, which will be the engine rooms for new economic activity and sectors.  In such districts there will be a high concentration of people with occupations classified by Richard Florida (2002) as the ‘creative class’ that will collectively be a new driver for the local economy and thus stimulate growth of local services and supply chains5.  In the City Centre Doctor Project, the partner cities have opportunities to examine how their city centres could become future people friendly as well as technological and talent laden connected places for new economic activity and growth. Their journey is one to find ways to shape city centres to become viable places for future generations. It is contextualised by global and European goals for sustainable development and growth. In the process more residents will take pride in their city centre and through stronger personal attachment also take responsibility for the vitality of their place.  It matters who is your city centre. The feel, the connectedness, the vibe. As Jan Gehl observes: First we shape cities, then they shape us.  
3. Global context for revitalisation of city centres  
The experience of weather conditions that are unseasonal or that are exceptionally harsh reminds us that our life styles and that our built environment cannot insulate us against the major forces of Nature. As is now clear from research on Climate Change, our survival as cities depend on how we affect change in our cities to transform our local economies to low carbon economies while at the same time build resilience to adapt to more dramatic extreme weather episodes. As Hank Paulson6, former US Treasury Secretary who had to deal with the 2008 financial crisis that started the Great Recession, warns: The greenhouse gas crisis, however, won’t suddenly manifest itself with a burst, like that of a financial bubble. Climate change is more subtle and cruel. It’s cumulative. And our current actions don’t just exacerbate the situation —they compound it. Indeed, our failure to make decisions today to avert climate disaster tomorrow is even more serious than our failure to avert the credit crisis in 2008.  It is obvious that the lifestyle and modus operandi that evolved in the 19th and 20th century, associated with the spoils of fossil fuelled technologies, will have to change. A new framework for living sustainably is required. In September 2015 the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development was adopted by 193 countries at the United Nations7. This Agenda is communicated as 17 Global Goals depicted in the infographic below. For this Project we will facilitate the commitment of partner cities to contribute to targets8 for Global Goal No 11 Sustainable Cities and Communities, in particular objective (c): To enhance inclusive and sustainable urbanisation and capacity for participatory, integrated and sustainable human settlement, planning and management.  To have global goals is a positive step into the future and will require better governance at city level enabling collaboration of role players to develop and implement appropriate actions with more transparency and less social exclusion. To establish such governance levels, role players will benefit from intercity exchange and learning9. The URBACT method provides a framework for action planning working groups10 that include the key stakeholders to drive sustainable integrated local urban development. In the City Centre Doctor Project each city will establish a URBACT Local Group (ULG) with a remit to revitalise their city centres with an integrated approach to address economic, social and environmental challenges.  The work of the ULGs will contribute to a positive local environment for business growth and anticipated job creation. The primary growth policy of the European Union, the Cohesion Policy11 contains 11 Thematic Objectives to guide programmes and projects. Successful implementation of actions by the ULG partners will contribute to the achievement of Thematic Objective 3: Enhancing the competitiveness of small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs).  The approach in the Project will be for partner cities to use the URBACT method to develop appropriate plans for their city centres utilising the following processes: Collaboration of stakeholders in the URBACT Local Group (ULG) which will include action implementation extending beyond the project period as well as continuing development of related projects and programmes in an integrated sustainable manner. Networking by ULG members with local city organisations ; with other partner cities in the Project; and with other European cities during URBACT events. Transnational exchange and learning between partner cities in the City Centre Doctor Project during study visits and through providing peer to peer support. Community engagement with residents and businesses in the process of understanding and analysis of city issues and in developing and testing ideas for actions. Integrated Action Planning where the ULGs analyse their city centre challenges and opportunities from social, economic and environmental development perspectives and develop actions that will have impacts across all three strands. Most businesses in the city centre are small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs). A revitalised and more attractive city centre helps them to be more competitive. Using the URBACT method will enable the partner cities to address the following specific challenges for the local business environment such as: Learning how to make local economies more sustainable. Learning more about local consumer preferences and how the offer can be tailored to such preferences for example by increasing convenience and finding suitable hour. Learning how to make city centre shopping and the work experience more enjoyable. Learning how to establish an ecosystem for turning local creativity into jobs   The ULGs will also have the opportunity to examine some major trends that will impact on city centres as explored in the next chapters.  
9. Conclusion  
This paper covered a select number of areas in which cities can explore the trends and impacts for their city centre that should influence their strategies and visions for future sustainable integrated urban development of their city centres. The future city centre will not be viable if it is dominated by cars. The opportunity is there to improve mobility options for residents and visitors making the centre safer, more walkable and more liveable. Such a centre will have more footfall and hence potential for growth for local businesses.  If a city centre shows little exterior changes with an emphasis on preservation, then it could be perceived to be like a museum. New technologies however will enable new smart infrastructure and ways to re purpose existing elements of the built environment. The revitalising of the city centre should focus on future generations working and living in the city. Cities should plan for what is important for the younger generation. Their world is much more connected and positive towards new technologies and less driven by status symbols such as car ownership and living in big houses in the suburbs.  The city centre itself is central to how residents identify with their place. More and more people will not be satisfied to leave the development of the centre to the professionals. The many examples of more ‘bottom up’ community led processes to improve the city centres (placemaking) show that volunteers and lay persons in a city can work with agencies and professionals to effect transformative change.  The vitality and vibrancy of the city centre is dependent on the ability to generate and sustain jobs and hence how the local economy can be managed and stimulated. The profound changes in the retail sector brought about by the impact of online trading and changes in consumer behaviour are visible in city centres and requires a new approach. Furthermore, the impact of the Great Recession made people realise that depending on national and global stewardship of the economy does not cushion local adverse impacts.  It is also useful to consider what was not covered in this paper. Clearly wholesale urban renewal (e.g. demolishing buildings on a large scale to make room for new developments) and allocating more parking spaces should not be the first options to consider. It is possible to revitalise a city centre with the softer options which are focused on re use and re purpose of buildings and improvements of the public spaces. One should never underestimate the mixture of imagination, plants and paint to ‘fix’ a building or a street.  A key message is that municipalities are not always going to be problem solvers and neither should they take all the blame if business is not doing well. In successful city centres a range of stakeholders including business, young people, environmentalists, urbanists, sports clubs, cycle activists and urban designers to name a few, take a leadership role. It is not one agency’s role to create and sustain a place.  The solution to revitalising city centres lies in the process. The secret is to put in place a mechanism to galvanise local volunteers, leaders and resources across all stakeholders who work together and are able to experiment and implement a range of smaller actions which will have a transformative collective impact.  The process will take time. It will need a plan to get there.  The tensions that change bring cannot be ignored. People will have to be engaged in the process. There will not be consensus, but there should be ample and multiple opportunities for discussion, debate and the creative exchange of ideas and providing support. In 1961 Jane Jacobs described processes to revitalise and sustain a city as ‘organized complexity’. She argued for a ‘web way of thinking’ to work with dynamic inter relationships of systems, processes and self-organization and to move away from simplifying formulas that fit into professions and disciplines and that stifle catalytic changes50. Her thinking was prescient. Today the URBACT Programme provides a framework for cities to develop the mechanisms and approaches to facilitate sustainable integrated urban development. This requires an emphasis not only on the economic elements but also the environmental, social and demographic impacts of actions to revitalise the city centre51.  The City Centre Doctor Project will support ten cities to initiate and manage such processes to revitalise their city centres. It will be fascinating to see how as Jan Gehl observed that they shape their cities and how then their cities will shape them.

"Urbact - CityLogo Innovative place-brand management 
Very few transnational projects funded by the EU have addressed systematically the topic of place-branding to date, even though communication is becoming increasingly important in the strategic management of cities. Indeed more and more cities in Europe are involved in one way or another in processes of branding and re-branding. That is, in processes of positioning and re-positioning the city, trying to gain visibility in a changing economic landscape. However, such kinds of initiatives are often addressed without method, or they are merely approached as a matter of “logo and motto”, with little empathy with the feeling of local communities. Many of them end up with circumstantial or inconsistent results. In addition, the reducing public spending environment is pushing a radical re- think about how many cities should promote and market themselves. This is certainly an opportunity to set up more effective patterns for stakeholder involvement and management, which should aim at both co-production of the strategy and co-delivery of the communication initiatives, including in terms of financial coresponsibility. CityLogo, the URBACT network on Innovative Place Brand Management, has been launched as a reaction to the most common gaps in the way cities address branding and marketing. Undoubtedly the URBACT programme is the best framework to take a step forward on this issue, conducting a systematic process of collaborative research and exchange of experiences around the communication dimension in urban management. CityLogo partners, led by Utrecht, along with other cities who have expressed an interest, agreed that place-branding should be embedded in a broader and participatory process of re-thinking urban identities to then be translated into a coherent new narrative of the contemporary city, including a related strategy on visual communication. A multi-dimensional task fed by different perspectives and local agents, with a clear strategic scope. In short, a true exercise of integrated urban management. 
CITY BRANDING: DÉJÀ VU OR EMERGING PRACTICE?  
For some, place branding “is moving from its infant stage into adolescence” (Govers and Go, 2009). One can agree with it, if we also admit that planned attempts to self promote cities and places have a long history, as explained by Stephen Ward, a professor of planning history at Oxford, in a delightful essay (1998). However, that statement hides the fact that, in one way or another, within the last twenty years, many governments have undertaken strategies and initiatives aimed at branding and promoting their countries, regions and municipalities. In that sense, place branding is a déjà vu policy.  Nevertheless, it must be noticed that most of those practices approach the issue in a fragmented way or fall into a variety of inconsistencies, resulting in poor impacts or effects of very low durability. If we want integrated city communication strategies as tools to strengthen and give coherence to the work of targeting various specific groups, from visitors to business, and to reinforce urban identities at the same time, then it is clear that place branding is an emerging practice, still in its adolescence.  
Five common gaps in city branding.
  As many cities are involved, in some way, in processes of positioning, repositioning, attractiveness, reputation or urban transformation, place communication is a usual practice, specially targeting visitors and investors. However, such kinds of initiatives are often addressed without method, or they are merely approached as a matter of logo & motto and advertising, with little empathy with the feeling of local communities. Many of them end up with circumstantial or inconsistent results. In this sense, five common gaps can be identified in place branding:  The strategy gap. Branding as a matter of just “logo & motto & campaigns”, without a solid connection to a city’s strategic planning process, which should be built collectively. The community gap. Weak involvement of civil society and related stakeholders in city brand building and management. Initiatives that depend upon the willingness of a local government, more or less well advised by brand consultants, quickly break down. The timing gap. The question of circumstantial brands, only related to specific events. For instance, the European Capital of Culture competition seems to have gained much popularity in the last years. It simply may provoke lack of durability while positioning is a matter of time: the cycle of return on the branding investment is usually longer than any political cycle.  The performance gap. The real urban experience does not match the expectations created by the brand´s messages, with an effect of lack of credibility and authenticity. The differentiation gap. Cities in Europe seem to brand themselves on the same topics and qualifications –knowledge, creativity… The abuse of a short range of mainstream terms drags many branding strategies to the same common place, and subsequently distinctiveness between cities is limited.   We can also talk about the budget gap. In fact, the reducing public spending environment is pushing a radical rethink of how many cities should promote and market themselves, as is currently happening in many CityLogo partners such as Zaragoza, Utrecht or Aarhus. This is certainly an opportunity to set up more effective patterns for stakeholder involvement and management (business community, tourist promotion boards, University and the knowledge system…), which should aim at both coproduction of the strategy and codelivery of the communication initiatives, including in terms of financial coresponsibility. A benchmarking report by the Holland Business Promotion Office on more than 20 EU large cities, revealed that steps towards more integration and less fragmentation in respect of the city as a destination for visitors had occurred in one way or another, but none of the cities considered had made significant advances in creating a single brand and promotion strategy, also comprising inward investment attraction, R&D or talent (Medhurst et al, 2008) 1.  
An increasing interest for place branding.  
The increasing dissemination of the integrated approach in urban development and the need for cities and regions to position or reposition themselves in an extremely changing global arena. That is to gain positive visibility and attractiveness are acting as catalysts for the development of integrated and large scale city branding strategies.  Recently, the topic of place branding, specially nation branding, has captured the attention of public diplomacy, at a time when one of the few journals dedicated to place branding, Journal of Place Branding, edited by Palgrave Macmillan, was renamed as Journal of Place Branding and Public Diplomacy. Another emerging factor is the issue of cultural branding or, better said, flagship cultural projects and events as main drivers to build an urban narrative or city proposition (see Zukin, 1995; Evans, 2003; and Jensen, 2007) 2.  Size does not matter in city branding. Although visibility, reputation or attractiveness are key words in the field, its cornerstone is the concept of identity. In Portugal for example, the reference in terms of place branding is not Lisbon or Porto, but Óbidos, a town with just over 10,000 inhabitants, which has emerged as a benchmark in social innovation and creative based strategies. While Coimbra, the third most populated Portugal city, has joined the CityLogo partnership with the firm commitment to adopt a comprehensive city branding strategy, its neighbour Águeda (with a population of only 50,000) already has a local marketing plan. Another piece of evidence is the recent issue of a handbook about city branding in small towns (Baker, 2012).  Place branding is also increasingly being used at district level, as a tool in regeneration strategies for deprived areas. BRU+, as a project led the Brussels region’s development agency ADT?ATO in partnership with seven municipalities and ten regional public stakeholders, works on the reactivation of deprived urban areas and place branding plays a significant role in it. In that respect, the challenge is to go beyond a strict marketing focus and apply tools to collectively rethink the city or the place and to create a new contemporary place narrative, which should incorporate values such as informality, creativity, flexibility, hybridisation or international scope.  The Image Project Neighbourhood Branding for Deprived Urban Areas, an Interreg III?B project, brought together local districts of Antwerp (Belgium), Bristol (UK), Delft (Netherlands), Dublin (Ireland) and Zurich (Switzerland) on the issue of integrated neighbourhood renewal solutions. Improving the image was one of the key issues for this project in which local communities and stakeholders were involved in the development of their brand, to be incorporated into existing local action plans. 
BEYOND THE MARKETING APPROACH  
All these recent developments place branding and public diplomacy, cultural branding, branding the urban generation project, etcetera reflect a strong social demand for aspects related to image building and communication of places and territories. However, while the issue of place branding continues getting the attention basically of the business marketing schools and less of the professionals of place management or urban studies, this demand will be met only partially. This approach to spatial analysis from the business marketing schools can be illustrated in the definition of place branding given by Simon Anholt in 2004 as “the practice of applying brand strategy and other marketing techniques and disciplines to the economic, social, political and cultural developments of cities, regions and countries”. In 2006 Lodge says that place branding “encompasses everything a place wishes to sell” (cited in Hanna and Rowley, 2007).  
The city as corporation.  
“There are many substantial common characteristics of marketing and branding corporations and cities (…), they both have multidisciplinary roots, both address multiple groups of stakeholders, both have a high level of intangibility and complexity, both need to take into account social responsibility, both deal with multiple identities, both need a long term development. In this sense, corporate branding does seem to offer a multitude of lessons for implementing branding within cities” (Kavaratizis, 2008). A clear statement immediately followed for a big question mark without any further explanation: “nevertheless, it is not clear in what ways cities could be thought of as corporations and, therefore, whether city brands can be treated as corporate brands” (Kavaratzis, 2008) 3.  City branding from business marketing schools usually carries an oversimplification and certain lack of understanding on the complexity of the “urban question”, e.g. according to the renowned marketing scholar Philip Kotler (cited by Kavaratzis, 2008), it can be identified as “four distinctive strategies for place improvement, the core foundations for building a competitive advantage and these are: design (place as character), infrastructure (place as fixed environment), basic services (place as service provider) and attractions (places as entertainment and recreation)”. A rapid look into an article by two marketing scholars (Hanna and Rowley, 2007) trying to clarify the use of terms like place and other “geographical entities”, reveals the simplistic way of using a spatial?based vocabulary by many scholars and practitioners involved in place branding. Why not overcome such a weakness by opening a dialogue with the geographical thinking?  
City brand as metaphor.  
One of the early influential consultants on place branding and expert on nation branding, Simon Anholt, started to feel uncomfortable with the term branding as for many it meant to assign logo & motto, advertising and PR campaigns a central role, and more generally with the limitations when applying mainstream marketing concepts and tools to space and places. Thus, he proposes the term “competitive identity”, envisioning the field within a future and revised public diplomacy when considering the country level (Anholt, 2007, 2008, 2010).  At city level this approach is valuable since it matches to the question of building a new narrative for the contemporary city. But if we do not keep this “unconventional way” of place branding within the limits of strategic city communication, and on the contrary face the issue like a sort of totalizing function, even overlapping with the local political power itself, then operational capacity of city branding could be diminished. In our view there is room to innovate in integrated place branding, going far beyond the logo motto campaigns, while keeping the issue as strategic city communication. Innovative city brand managers should work closely with strategic urban planners and Mayor´s cabinets, but not replace them.  However, a major contribution by Anholt for this transition to a specific paradigm for place branding, outside the conventional mainstream marketing and simplistic analogies between cities and corporations, is to see the concept of place brand as a metaphor (Anholt, 2008, 2010) that embraces a strategic and complex process which starts building strong place identities.  “There is a big difference between observing that places have brand images (which is simply a useful metaphor) and claiming that places can be branded (which is an excessively ambitious, entirely unproven and ultimately irresponsible claim). Place branding (…) observes the former but does not claim the latter”.  Simon Anholt (2008) Indeed, for many marketing driven scholars and practitioners a place brand can be created or designed. A comprehensive approach, more embedded into the “urban question”, would say that a solid place brand cannot be created but unveiled, through an exercise of collective place making involving local institutions, people and even hidden voices. That is the kind of process we can truly call city brand building. Identifying the brand as a metaphor, when we are dealing with cities and places, as a process which is slightly more complex and ambitious than creating a logo&motto.  
What branding for places? 
 Place branding needs to be revisited from a spatialized ontology 4. Unfortunately scholars who are more directly involved with space like urban geographers, cultural geographers, urban sociologists, urban planners, etc, have faced city promotion or place marketing as “soft” questions, as an issue that lacks intellectual stimulus. Fruitful and promising lines of thinking about how geographical imaginaries are built have not crossed the boundaries of an endogamous academic world. It actually reveals a lack of capability to connect with the problems of the practitioners involved in urban management and more specifically in city promotion. But it should not be forgotten that according to the dictionary of Human Geography (Johnston, R.J. 1986), which quotes the geographer Yi Fu Tuan, a place is also a “repository of meaning or an object of intentionality” (Tuan, 1977).  Places should be liberated to some extent from the rhetoric of competition. When applied to spaces and places, it does not necessary mean to play exactly the same game of competition than in the globalized corporate capitalism (Urwin, 2005), which by the way currently finds itself in a crisis of model. In some way we are a bit exhausted by the fact that the usual rhetoric of rivalry, competition, “product offering” and the very term of brand should be automatically transferred to collective and complex structures like cities 5. That is why a more spatialized ontology of place branding can be valuable, as a matter of better filtering the adoption of concepts and approaches from business and marketing management.  Lastly, such a spatialized ontology will have the virtue to promote specific urban semiotics, like particular codes for visual communication when dealing with the city, which should result in less naive or bizarre ways of advertising and communicating cities and regions. In this sense it was impressive and shameful to see, years ago, advertisements by some States of the USA in magazines like Expansion Management in which they marketed themselves with the same logic as for a pack of cigarettes or a shower gel.  
The scope of integrated city branding.  
With this in mind, terms like branding or strategic communication seem more suitable than marketing and promotion, because they fit better the simple, but huge, ambitions of strengthening local identities, positioning cities more clearly and gaining visibility; instead of putting first, and somewhat arrogantly, the emphasis on attractiveness. Attractiveness might be an effect of focused positioning and strong identities.  At this point we have to know the scope of what is called integrated city branding. Thus, the quality of the research institutions in a city, the skill of the local labour marketplace, the level of performance by its local business clusters… are key assets for branding & marketing the city as a place for business. But the local team involved in designing and monitoring city branding strategy does not have to take any stake in the quality and level of performance related to those assets. Place branding should stay as much as possible at the level of strategic and operational communication. In any case that is a sophisticated position, the city relational interface, requiring a high level interaction with both the rest of the city departments and related local stakeholders. That is why city branding units are often situated directly within the Mayor´s office.  In other words, the quality of the city business facilities, having an efficient landing pad service for foreign investors or not, or the taxis drivers´ s level of honesty are important for the experience of the city brand, but the quality of such activities cannot be the direct responsibility of the city brand manager.  In this sense, ideally, integrated city branding or teams involved in city branding should not take responsibility either in creating the city's comprehensive discourse or narrative this normally has to come from conventional strategic urban planning procedures, nor in the quality of the city performance, a task widely distributed to many institutional stakeholders, public and private, civil society and citizenship. So, some unrealistic ways of envisioning the role of city branding as a sort totalizing local policy might be put in question. A sustainable city branding process cannot replace poor performances by other city departments. That is why consistent integrated city branding is a sign of maturity in local governance. Not all territorial systems of governance, even nations, are ready to assume integrated place branding. And here size does not matter.  
3/ Approaching a shared learning itinerary 2013-2015
  RESPONDING TO SHORTSIGHTED VIEWS IN CITY BRANDING: A CITYLOGO COMPREHENSIVE MODEL 
 CityLogo, the URBACT project on Brand Management in Modern Urban Policies, was actually born as a reaction to the most common gaps in the way cities address branding and marketing. A reaction to a superficial and misguided understanding of the field, as solely related to media and PR campaigns. The current low public spending environment is generating a radical rethink of how cities should promote and market themselves, as in the case of Zaragoza or Utrecht, for instance. This is certainly an opportunity to set up more effective patterns for stakeholder involvement and management (business community, tourist promotion boards, University and the knowledge system, main city facilities…), which should lay the foundations for both coproduction of the strategy and coresponsibility. CityLogo envisions place-branding beyond the conventional marketing approach, conserving however a profound pragmatism, which is something necessary for the practitioners involved in the day-to-day management of the issue. A policy that should be embedded in a broader and participatory process of rethinking urban identities, to then be translated into a coherent set of textual and visual tools. A multidimensional task fed by different perspectives and local agents, with a clear strategic scope. In short, a true exercise of integrated urban management. This is why the URBACT programmes the most suitable framework to move forward n this issue, conducting a systematic process of collaborative research and exchange of experiences around the communication dimension in urban management. Consequently, the “URBACT method” is providing the main drivers that will shape and inspire a cross-learning itinerary on city branding for the coming years, namely :  CityLogo will work for a better positioning of the cities involved, in the forthcoming post-crisis economic arena, increasing differentiation and visibility at national, European and global levels. CityLogo will work on the reinforcement of the communication dimension, as a true integrated urban function, by increasing its coherence with local potentials and a more relational style of local governance.   CITYOGO will promote: i) more direct participation of citizens in delivering “official storyboards” of the contemporary city; ii) more effective stakeholder involvement in codelivering strategic communication of cities; iii) and more efficient articulation with regional/national strategies concerning place branding and marketing.   In sum, CityLogo is rooted in all the key principles of the next Urban Policy in Europe (EUROPEAN COMMISSION, 2011): integrated urban development, community-led development, multilevel governance, and reaction to the ongoing economic crisis, which is actually a crisis of model. To that aim URBACT CityLogo will work in the next years with its own comprehensive model for city branding, identifying clearly both the phases of brand building and of brand management. 
CITYLOGO THEMATIC STRUCTURE  
Combining the state of the art with lessons from both best practice and the most common gaps and failures, the ambition of CityLogo is to run a cutting-edge project on innovative place-brand management. Moreover, the project work plan fits the participating cities´ current background as well as their expectations for moving forward in the field.  The following issues have been identified by the city partners during the preparatory phase as their main priorities:  Integrated city branding strategies, as a common working area for entities and bodies targeting different groups: tourist & visitors, business, talent, etc.   Beyond the marketing approach: city branding as an opportunity for building and delivering updated narratives of the contemporary city. A narrative collectively fed by local backgrounds, real assets, flagship projects, emerging processes, expectations, desires...   Models for re-adapting city branding to a low pubic spending environment.   Need for efficient public-private partnerships in order to coproduce and codeliver city branding strategies. To that purpose URBACT Local Support Groups will be shaped with the ambition to go beyond a consultation function, that is, as platforms to negotiate new ways for codelivering city branding initiatives. Getting effective commitment from local stakeholders to adopt and use brand toolkits (logo, images, and core messages). How to combine (mutual reinforcement) city-branding with communication strategies related to specific big events and projects, i.e. European Capitals of Culture.   Better articulation with other place branding strategies at national and regional levels. Role for cities in Country-branding strategies.   City branding to socialize flagship urban projects and emerging processes among the local population. How to engage local people in place branding.  The impact of the digital shift on new channels and measures for city promotion.   “How to keep the brand strategy fresh and current, after the impact of the launching phase”: continuous feedback to improve and refresh both the brand and related management system.   How to measure the impact of city branding & marketing policies.   Benchmarking. There is poor knowledge on what´s going on in other cities and regions concerning place branding.   Impact of globalization on the scope of city branding: “How a medium sized European urban agglomeration might target China or some other emerging economy?” Territorial coalitions and alliances for collective branding.

Socializing flagship projects and emerging dynamics. How to engage locals in place branding.  New strategies for segmentation: from sectoral branding to the cloud of targets.   
POTENTIAL OF THE PARTNERSHIP FOR “LEARING BY INTERACTING”  
All the partners have some background in the field of city branding and marketing, and they have all expressed a political and technical commitment for moving forward. However, the level of experience and maturity among them is different. That asymmetry contributes to make the project a fruitful cross-learning exercise. Partners´ experience has been assessed according to two parameters:  Development of an integrated approach in city branding, understood as a common strategy and framework for all local agents targeting different groups – visitors, business, etc;   Level of stakeholder engagement in city-brand management.   As the figure shows, level of performance is not correlated to the city´s rank-size. It should also be considered that cities with a good level of performance in both parameters may have weaknesses in other issues of city branding, and vice versa. This will be taken into account for matchmaking each city´s strengths and weaknesses in order to deliver a more accurate cross-learning agenda for every participating city. 24 Beyond the field of place branding, many common features between the partners can be highlighted, what will make the shared learning itinerary a bit smoother:  All the partners with a coastal location are involved in large-scale waterfront redevelopments. This is the case in Oslo, Dundee, Aarhus and Genoa.   Zaragoza and Coimbra have undertaken huge riverfront re-development projects. Future plans in Coimbra to continue a process still unfinished.   Renzo Piano´s footprint in Genoa waterfront, but also in the new centre of contemporary art in the Oslo waterfront.   The “polar connection” between Dundee and Oslo. The fist around the polar ship RSS Discovery and the Captain Scott´ adventure; and the second around Roald Amudsen’s expeditions and the Fram.   All the partners are currently tackling major construction projects and the development of new flagship buildings and facilities, particularly Utrecht, Oslo, Dundee, Zaragoza, Aarhus and Coimbra.   Strong connections to the European Capital of Culture initiative: Genoa and Vilnius have already hosted the event; Aarhus will do so in 2017; Utrecht is applying for 2018. Alba Iulia has expectations for 2021.   Genoa and Zaragoza first decided to impulse a strategy on city branding just after hosting a World Exhibition, in 1992 and 2008 respectively.   Utrecht, Coimbra and Aarhus as University towns.   Powerful healthcare clusters in Coimbra and Oslo. Competitive renewable clusters in Aarhus and Dundee. World-class logistics clusters in Genoa and Zaragoza. Cruise sector in Genoa and Oslo, etc.   
ADDRESSING THE URBACT LOCAL SUPPORT GROUPS  
During the preparatory phase in 2012, all the partners involved in CityLogo expressed the ambition for addressing URBACT Local Support Groups as potential platforms not just for participation in designing city brand strategies, but also for implementing them and codelivering the set of communication initiatives. In this sense, leadership and capacity of facilitation will be required to conduct the process as a win-win initiative, where nobody will lose. For the partners with no substantial previous experience in stakeholder involvement within city promotion, the project will be an excellent opportunity, as in the cases of Genoa, Coimbra or Oslo, for instance. For others who are running some kind of collaboration platforms –such as the Aarhus Marketing Alliance or the Advisory Board for Dundee-brand there may be room for improvement.  In any case, the work to be done by the Local Support Groups will be clearly integrated in the CityLogo comprehensive model. In this sense, the mission and main tasks of the local groups of stakeholders may range from brand-design orientation to brand-management, depending on each partner´ s level of maturity in the field. A first choice on the composition of the URBACT Local Support Groups has been made by the participating cities. Some adjustments will have to be made before starting a systematic work during the implementation phase. At this point, a number of key messages can be made facing the specific field of place branding:  To ensure a more balanced participation of the private sector: global players, experts, business associations and chambers of commerce and son on.   To ensure participation of local bodies which are more engaged with the outside world like port authorities, technology parks, cluster management structures, fair and congress centres etc.   To try the engagement of entity(s) at regional/national levels to ensure effective multi-governance in city branding, going beyond the municipality and its nearby satellites.   To catch the attention of local schools of design and architecture and similar entities... aimed at creating inputs for the strategy in visual communication, and more broadly to promote what hereby we have called a better “visual culture of the city”. For instance, we mean entities like DOGA Norwegian Centre for Design & Architecture in Oslo, Centro de Artes Visuais de Coimbra or ETOPIA-Centre for Arts and Technology in Zaragoza.   To involve the creative sector as a suitable area for testing some integration in city promotion between both the business and tourist worlds.

"City Mobil Net 
Network for co-productive development of sustainable urban mobility plans empowering cities to create joint visions, targets and sets of measures to manage their future city progress. 

Introduction: urban transportation as a problem of high awareness CityMobilNet answers to the policy challenge of how to plan and subsequently develop urban mobility in a sustainable way. The best descriptions of this challenge as well as of the urgency and importance implied by it are actually given within two important strategic documents of the European Commission (EC) on urban mobility, its “Action plan on urban mobility” (COM(2009)490 final) and its “Urban Mobility Package” (COM(2013)913 final): The EU’s cities are home to 70% of the EU’s population and are generating over 80% of the EU’s GDP (Cities of Tomorrow, European Commission, 2011). They are thus at the core to main objectives of the EC such as growth and employment. For this, cities need efficient transport systems to support their economy and the welfare of its inhabitants. But they face the challenge that mobility within the cities is increasingly difficult to manage and even displays an increasing inefficiency. Recent data displays that cities: - account for about 23% of all CO2 emissions from all transport in Europe - are virtually all struggling with complying to EU legislation on air quality - suffer from chronic traffic congestion which is estimated to cost 80 billion Euros each year (Total cost of congestion; see SEC(2011)358 final) - are the location where 38% of Europe’s road fatalities occur with the fact that progress in reducing road fatalities has been below average compared to non-urban areas - are producing a considerable development gap between a few advanced cities in terms of sustainable urban mobility development against a large majority trailing behind The reason for this is the complex challenge that the development of urban mobility comprises: cities need to design their urban mobility taking diverse aspects into consideration: - Urban mobility needs to be as environmentally friendly as possible in terms of reducing GHG emissions, other air pollutants and noise (coming up to the objective to reduce GHG emissions by 20% compared to the 1990 values in 2030 and by 60% in 2050). - Urban mobility needs to allow for a high competitiveness of its economy mainly hampered by high figures of congestion (see above) and the current state of play that urban mobility is still heavily reliant on the use of conventionally-fuelled vehicles. - Urban mobility needs to address social aspects such as health problems, demographic trends, economic and social cohesion, the needs of mobility impaired persons, of families, of children. - Urban mobility needs address long-distance transport, for goods and persons, since first and last mile are taking place in cities mainly. To summarise, European cities are facing the challenge to design their urban mobility in ecological, economic and social favourable ways – in short: sustainably – taking a participatory approach in this. To tackle the commonly recognised problem of urban transportation development, the EC (and by this the EU member states) identified the need for a new approach on urban transport planning. Former traditional planning mainly focused on a sectoral planning approach within an authority’s own limits. Moreover, traditional planning cultures mostly showed a strong focus on the objective to enhance traffic flow capacity and speed and related to these mainly infrastructural measures on the expense on behavioural and organisational measures. The idea was simply to provide enough road space for all users, but without a real user need assessment. Due to the technical knowledge needed for this approach, planning was mostly done by traffic engineers and participation of stakeholders and citizens was rather low. An integrated approach of planning transportation including the needs and goals of other urban policy areas as well as placing transportation development in the framework of the entire city development were hardly part of traditional transport planning. Traditional planning led to the problems of pollution, congestion, exclusion of population groups and a massive allocation of public space to mainly motorised individual transportation. The new planning approach however needed to give answers to the above mentioned needs and problems that cities are facing today. A part of this is that urban transport policies cannot be seen as a stand-alone development issue, since transport touches virtually all policy fields of cities and even more so all citizens’ living conditions. Stakeholders and citizens themselves were recognised to be a crucial part of urban transport development plans, since the transport system in place is used by them in the end and thus has to meet their needs. The European Commission took the lead in proposing and developing such a new planning approach step by step through its main policy documents of the most recent years, coming up to the definition and uptake of a planning scheme called “Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan (SUMP)”. The EC’s guideline on SUMPs defines them as follows: “A Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan is a strategic plan designed to satisfy the mobility needs of people and businesses in cities and their surroundings for a better quality of life. It builds on existing planning practices and takes due consideration of integration, participation, and evaluation principles.”1 The new approach of SUMPs can be summarised in the following main elements: - They put the emphasis of urban mobility planning on people’ / stakeholder’s needs. - They carry out the development of sustainable urban mobility in a strong participatory approach integrating citizens and stakeholders along the entire development process. - They deal with a balanced development of the different urban mobility modes and their intermodal use as well as the different mobility needs. - They aim for a change in mobility behaviour in favour of viable sustainable choice of transport mode. - They take on urban mobility in its both main strands: passenger traffic and goods. - They consider the functional urban area and are placing the actions on urban mobility into a wider urban and territorial strategy. - They are developed in cooperation with a city’ different policy areas (such as transport itself, land-use and spatial planning, environment, economic development, social policy, health, road safety) - They integrate different administration levels and neighbouring local authorities in the planning process. All in all, SUMPs are an instrument to answer the challenges cities face today as described above. They take a realistic view on existing spatial patterns and are striving for a sustainable development balancing the existing and often contrasting needs to a joint vision and future development. The special strength of SUMPs is that they their development requires the integration of all views of the different administration departments and policy makers, of stakeholders from all sectors of society such as the economy, social or environmental institutes and also citizens themselves. The Guidelines “Developing and Implementing a Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan” by the European Platform on Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans published a confrontation of the traditional planning approach and SUMPs (p.7, see source above). The following section is displaying the development of SUMPs by the European Commission alongside with the reasoning for introducing the concept.  

The development of SUMPs in the transportation and urban development strategies of the EU as an answer to the urban transportation challenge  The European Commission (EC) lists urban mobility development as one of the pressing issues of the  EU’s cities since long already as documented by the White Paper on Transportation, its forerunner  policy documents and its programmes dedicating initiatives on urban mobility. The EC introduced the concept or SUMPs in its more recent policy strategies and elaborated this concept consequently up to a detailed description alongside with measures to place and financial resources to dedicate.  This started in 2007 with the Green paper “Towards a new culture for urban mobility” (COM(2007)551final). It states the need for mobility plans integrating the wider metropolitan conurbation to realise comprehensive and feasible urban mobility development. It defines Sustainable Urban Transport Plans as the appropriate tool and names the development of such SUTPs to be addressed in the discussion for the development of the Action Plan on urban mobility.  This statement proved true, since the development of the Action plan on urban mobility (COM(2009)490final), for which extensive stakeholder consultations e.g. with cities took place,  resulted in placing the need for the development of SUMPs (previously SUTP) as the plan’s very first  action. By this Action 1, Theme 1, the EC encourages local authorities to produce SUMPs for their urban / conurban area and announces support for this by providing guidance materials, best practice exchange and educational measures.  This strand of recognising the challenge of urban mobility had been further developed by the EC in its White Paper on Transport “Roadmap to a Single European Transport Area – Towards a competitive and resource efficient transport system -COM(2011)144 final). As published in 2011, the EC states that “today”, the cities of the European Union suffer most from congestion, poor air quality and  noise exposure. Latest developments had shown no improvements but rather a setback, while urban  transportation is expected to contribute to the fulfilment of the transport sector’s GHG emission  reduction goals. The White paper calls for fostering Urban Mobility Plans, which comprise land use planning elements and all policy areas related to transportation. It thus sets a dimension for the future of mobility planning as a non-sectoral but comprehensive planning task.  The major document for the definition of SUMPs and their role in developing urban mobility schemes sustainably was published as the Urban Mobility Package (COM(2013)913final) finally.  Its first action and one of the main answers to the urban mobility challenge directly addresses the need for new approaches to urban mobility planning in form of Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans. In this, the EC stresses the comprehensive nature of SUMPs comprising all aspects of transportation being well placed in cities’ overall strategies and connected with other policy areas. It calls especially for a focus on people as main drivers of urban mobility and by this the urgent need for citizen and stakeholder engagement in the production of SUMPs. The EC however highlights the necessity that the concept of SUMPs needs to be adapted to the specific requirements and existing planning practices in each Member State and their respective local authorities.  The Urban Mobility Package describes a SUMP’s main characteristics:  - They consider the functional urban area and are placing the actions on urban mobility into a wider urban and territorial strategy.  - They are developed in cooperation with a city’s different policy areas (such as transport  itself, land-use and spatial planning, environment, economic development, social policy,  health, road safety); with different governmental administration levels and are integrating  authorities in neighbouring areas, be it rural or urban areas.  - They deal with a balanced development of the different urban mobility modes and their intermodal use as well as the different mobility needs.  - They take on urban mobility in its both main strands: passenger traffic and good transportation.  - They put the emphasis of urban mobility planning in this on people’ / stakeholder’s needs.  - They aim for a change in mobility behaviour in favour of viable sustainable choice of transport mode.  - They carry out the development of sustainable urban mobility in a strong participatory approach being a co-productive one integrating citizens and stakeholders along the entire  development process.  SUMPs are further characterised and described by the first Annex to the Urban Mobility Package COM(2013)913final).  The EC as well states in the Urban Mobility Package its support to national, regional and local  authorities to develop and implement SUMPs by two aspects mainly:  1) Facilitating exchange of experience and best practice. In detail, the EC specifies this as measures to share experience, showcase best-practice and foster cooperation across the EU through e.g. by the URBACT III programme (COM(2013)913  final).  2) Financial support:  European Structural and Investment Funds (ESI-funds) should be used more systematically  for funding of integrated packages of measures based on integrated local transport plans  such as SUMPs. These funds should be available for cities of all sizes and aim at creating opportunities for capacity building, training, technical assistance and the development of comprehensive and local mobility strategies and plans.  By the Urban Mobility Package, the EC consequently elaborated the development of SUMPs and their characteristics as set out in 2007 by the Green Paper on urban mobility already. It assigns high priority to the use and take-up of SUMPs by local authorities and integrates all policy levels to this aim. The EC itself further commits funding and programmes to the goal of achieving a sustainable urban mobility development.    

Conclusions for CityMobilNet from the State of the Art.   
The European Commission stresses the importance the concept of SUMPs is expected to take in tackling the urban transportation problems Europe’s cities are facing today. By putting an emphasis on a comprehensive approach, focus on citizens’ needs as well as integrated planning with intense stakeholder and citizen participation, costs from congestion as well as high loads of GHG, particle and noise emissions should be reduced. The EC is investing considerable effort and resources to foster the uptake of SUMPs by its member states, their cities as well as transport professionals: Highest visibility of EC investment shows the European Platform on Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans and its guidelines on the development of Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans. The platform offers - explanation of the SUMP concept and process, - extensive guidance by its guidelines including practical and methodological examples, - the current development’s state of play of the SUMP concept by the running and recently finished EU-projects on SUMPs - a case study section showing practical implementation examples from cities EU-wide - learning and exchange of experience events with the highlight of the yearly European Conference on Sustainable Urban Mobility Planning All these services are of high relevance to the CityMobilNet partners for their task of developing their respective SUMP. Some special lessons can be drawn from the Platform and its guideline: - Partners should create a permanent team of representatives from different policy departments, which is reporting to elected representatives, aldermen and if feasible the Mayor constantly to keep them informed and committed. - Partners should take good consideration for the skills they need to develop their SUMP. From that, the task is to plan how to gain capacities and skills through CityMobilNet’s transnational seminars as well as through external support, such as including universities to their work. - Partners must translate the new focus of mobility planning being people – SUMPs focus on people’s needs and people’s involvement – into their own planning process and SUMPs. - The guidelines on SUMP development describe a well-developed and documents process, but they are yet guidelines: the local situation is always a different one and needs adaptations and own rules, which are deviating from the ideal case process as laid out in the guidelines. CityMobilNet’s partners need to consider this and have to remain open-minded enough to deviate, whenever this is to their benefit. The uptake of the SUMP concept by member states is showing a clustered picture. There is historically given uptake in some exceptions, full uptake in rare cases, uptake in form of connecting access to EC-Operational Funds for transport to the existence of a SUMP as well as no uptake but similar planning process in place and simply no. For CityMobilNet partners, this first means to adapt to changes. That these happen show the examples of Hungary and Croatia, which have just recently introduced the need for a SUMP to be able to apply for OP funds. Knowledge on potential next steps by their government might be useful in terms of how to design their SUMPs, when they need to be finished with it as well as who to integrate to the development process in terms of national responsible representatives for legislation. Second this means for cities on countries with little or no uptake information on where to look for other countries city examples: the higher the level obligation to produce SUMPs for cities, the higher the number of SUMP case studies will be. The currently most used form of SUMP uptake is the connection of applying to OP funds only with SUMPs in place (ES, IT, HR, HU, PL, PT). Depending on the time of introducing this rule, the number of case study cities is a larger one. Third, the integration of SUMPs to general city development as demanded in Romania and France is of high interest to CityMobilNet’s partners. Integrated planning is one of the approaches of both, URBACT and SUMPs, which makes good practice and methods on how to perform this, most interesting. Additionally, cities in the Netherlands tend nowadays to fully place mobility plans into spatial and environmental policy plans. There are no own mobility plans any longer. This development, should it be successful, might be a future radical change to mobility plans once again. Nevertheless, SUMPs are a step in this direction already, since they are integrated with other plans and policy fields. Almost all countries for CityMobilNet provide cities with some good practice of SUMP development and implementation at hand. This is especially important to enable all cities not only to look at international examples and exchange of experience but to have information from the same background at hand as well. Malta sticks out here, since the only two examples for mobility plans in the spirit of SUMPs known right now are from Tarxien and Paolo, two councils on the South East Region of Malta, the CityMobilNet partner. Regional SUMP development are still rare (but existing mainly through the EU funded project Poly-Sump), which would be of special interest for the Metropole Aix Marseille Provence, who looks to create a method of transferring their regional SUMP to local circumstances. The European Platform on Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans’ coordinating group consists for the largest part out of recent EU funded project on SUMP development. All of them deliver useful results and information for CityMobilNet. However, the following ones are especially valid: - The EVIDENCE project for its summary report on “The Economic Benefits of Sustainable Transport Actions” and its “Access To Evidence” database. - The Ch4llenge project for its 4 Ch4llenge descriptions and the coming 4 Ch4llenge kits to come spring 2016. - The PUMAS project for its “Alpine Voice on SUMP” with 10 key messages on the state of SUMP development - The ENDURANCE project for providing the best information source on national state of play of SUMPs as well as a high number of city examples on SUMP - The ADVANCE project for its audit scheme being a support for SUMP starters as well as an monitoring options of the SUMP progress Most of EU-funded projects have produced training materials of relevance for the coming transnational seminars.

"1. Introduction   
1.1 Main objectives of CityRegion.Net   
As already stated in the EEA report No. 10/2006 and in the Communication from the Commission on “Cohesion Policy and cities: the urban contribution to growth and jobs in the regions”, urban sprawl is synonymous with unplanned incremental urban development and creates environmental, social and economic impact.  By discussing different aspects of multi-level governance the network addresses the question of how cities and regions can steer, coordinate and organize their future spatial development in order to improve their competitiveness and to guarantee sustainability. The – more and more complex - regional steering and coordination structures therefore include formal and informal elements as well as governmental and non-governmental actors.  The functional, political and administrative linkage of cities and their surrounding municipalities is enormous and at the same time regional economic problems do not end at city limits. Furthermore, a fair sharing of costs and burdens between the cities and their neighboring municipalities is a matter of central concern.  The central challenge of this network lays therefore in reacting to this dynamic of development. The future European city faces the situation of having to preserve its identity and of having to be a motor for development at the same time. Therefore the partner cities will focus on the integration of their surrounding areas into the common urban planning process of the cities.  As a result of all these problems, surrounding municipalities should be integrated more into the general development and urban planning in the future.  Therefore the partner cities of this network intend to define common strategies in developing  “master plans for cities and their surroundings” including not only strategic measures but also  the implementation by concrete pilot projects (e.g. in the field of mobility questions).  The main objective of this network therefore is the elaboration of working programmes and policy recommendations for improving the cooperation between cities and their surrounding municipalities. The main challenges include:  1. Common land use policies and instruments for integrated urban – regional planning.  2. Definition of new financial instruments to meet the multiple tasks and projects of general interest.  3. Identification of successful regional structures as basis for city hinterland cooperation.  4. The participation of relevant key actors by (re-)defining the criteria for integrated regional development.    
4.2 Key issues of exchange
Graz:
Strategies of an integrative development
1. for a better coordination of the city with the surrounding municipalities.
2. for a better cooperation in traffic problems.
3. for the improvement of the framework and the access to inner city areas.
4. for a common spatial plan and against urban sprawl.
5. for new aspects of regional cooperation in the field of legal and financial instruments,
shared tasks and participation processes.
Częstochowa:
1. Methodologies of the formation “Częstochowa Metropolitan Area” and close
cooperation between the City of Częstochowa and neighbouring municipalities
2. Solutions on integrated and sustainable urban management, development planning
and efficient management of the city space.
3. Tools for the improvement of functioning and development of modern transport
system: in the city and out of the city (neighbouring municipalities).
4. Strategies for the stimulation of enterprise development and innovation of local
economy and public services to secure a high dynamic economy development.
5. Tools for the revitalization of the city centre, degraded areas and land development
of the housing estates.
6. Elaboration of sustainable development and environment protection programme for
the city and implementation of environmental management, especially in the range of
the power planning and power, heat, gas and water supply.
Châlons-en-Champagne:
1. France has experimented since 1982 the development of inter-communal
relationships. As such, Châlons-en-Champagne could share with the partners of the
network its experience in inter-communal cooperation.
2. Also, the implementation of the territorial strand of the competitiveness operational
programme requires the establishment of specific governance for the selection and
the development of projects granted by ERDF. This methodology is not applied in all
French regions and probably not in other European regions. Thus, the local support group may rely on the steering committee of the programme developed for this
occasion.
3. Finally, the Community of agglomeration participates in an experimentation of the
French government for the development of specific governance for urban renewal
projects. Only 20 medium-sized French cities participate to this experimentation,
which probably will begin in September in Châlons-en-Champagne. The results of
this project could also be shared by the URBACT partners.
4. The city of Châlons-en-Champagne is especially interested in comparing the methods
of governance and implementation strategies.
5. Additionally, strategies for the identification of criteria for projects of common interest
and for financing them and innovative methods for the identification of stakeholders
should be developed within the network.
Oradea:
1. The elaboration of a Local Action Plan.
2. The setting-up of a Local Support Group, with relevant partners with expertise on
integrated urban planning;
3. Identification of best practices, recommendations for managing the spatial planning at
the metropolitan level.
4. Financial Instruments.
Kielce:
1. Regional solutions for transport system issues;
2. Issues and solutions connected with public-private partnership: if it works, when it
works, how it can be used the best for inhabitants;
3. Methodologies connected with straggling against urban sprawl and suburbanization
4. Soft measures: how to build effective cooperation with hinterlands so everybody has
the win-win situation.
Trikala:
1. Measures for a rational solid and liquid waste management, implementation of
innovative recycling system.
2. Methods for the development of “Green Spaces” and “cultural heritage” (Integration of

Best practices, know-how, adaptation of models to local needs.
Local Action Plans.
Proactive policy to improve the different cooperation forms.

Setting up a local support group or steering committee for identification of key stakeholders and projects to be implemented on the territory. Establishment of a steering committee for political validation of the various stages of experimentation.  Mobilizing the population through the so-called neighborhood councils. Realization of communication tools. Information campaigns for the dissemination of the project activities. Creation of a network database, where the Lead Partner collects best practices of all the partners in those pre-defined fields of urban planning that are of most interest    
10. Conclusion and analysis  
Cities function as motors for social and economic development and are vital for common integrated planning. They are also basic service providers for the whole region. It is essential that urban development and planning goes hand in hand with integrated development of the hinterland.  On basis of the city visits, the baseline questionnaires and the outcome of the two workshops, the main issues of the thematic network CityRegion.Net can be described as the following:  The main overall objective of this network is the elaboration of working programmes and policy recommendations for improving the cooperation between cities and their surrounding municipalities as described in the Declaration of interest. The special issues that all of the network’s partners would like to be addressed have been now clustered into two sub-themes and not three as described in the Declaration of Interest. All the partners agreed that the planning tools should be linked with the financing instruments because it is of utmost interest to also develop financing possibilities for projects of common interest. The interdisciplinary  subject deals with processes of citizens’ participation.  The two sub-themes are:  1. Planning tools and financing instruments for a sustainable city-hinterland  development with the focus on:  a) Tools for efficient land use and against suburbanization  b) Tools for an efficient public transport system between city and its region  c) Tools for a sustainable economic development and the revitalization of the  city-centers  d) Tools for efficient environmental development  e) Definition of criteria for projects of common interest and possibilities of  financing them  2. Regional structures as basis for a successful cooperation with the focus on:  a) Necessary regional structures for a successful city-hinterland (region) cooperation and methods of financing them  b) Shared functions and tasks  c) Special methodologies for cooperation between big city and smaller  municipalities  d) Strategies on the involvement of key players and key investors  e) Legal preconditions for city-hinterland (region) cooperations. By exchanging experiences, finding best practices and case studies, but also by identifying barriers the network would like to define key success criteria for an efficient cooperation between a city and its hinterland (surrounding region).  Individualized solutions and implementation measures should be found for the main challenges of each city (summarized in each Local Action Plan) with the help of these common criteria. By the inclusion of the local stakeholders and the Managing Authorities in the Urbact Local Support Group a constant coordination with the key players in the region is  guaranteed and the implementation of the defined measures should be facilitated.

"1 CoNet – The cohesion network.  
The general idea of our network is to learn more about integrated approaches to strengthen social cohesion in neighbourhoods and to implement this knowledge in innovative local projects – especially in the fields of community life, economy and employment and education. Concern: Need for action Integrated approaches do have more impact to improve the situation than traditional and sectorial projects. This is highly needed – especially in CoNet´s concerned urban areas. Social segregation and polarisation are increasing, even in rich European cities – in spite of the fact that a lot has been done to improve sustainable living conditions in deprived areas and to better the chances of the inhabitants. Of particular importance to social cohesion are the fields of economy and employment, education and community life, themes which CoNet decided to focus on. Depending on the local situation, other important fields – like housing, health or environment – may of course also be included within the framework of integrated projects. Topic: How to bring action fields and actors together? Various programmes helped to disseminate the integrated approach across Europe, but it still remains a major challenge to manage these complex forms of cooperation in concrete local projects. This includes the enlarged forms of cooperation, decision making and realisation. A large range of partners has to be included: from local, regional or national authorities to economic actors and civil society. This means coordinating different levels of responsibilities, learning to work with different professional cultures as well as with the citizens of the neighbourhoods themselves, who often do not have the same opinions and the same communication patterns. In short: the issue is, to explore new governance and its role in the management of integrated area based approaches. How we proceed Action learning is the way we want to work within the network; this means target based learning from the partners local practice and for the projects the cities selected for procession. Thereby we can benefit from the analysis of best practice examples – that are numerous in our network – as well as examples documented by others. Mutual consulting, visits and short internships will take place. These exchanges should primarily explore working processes and methodologies, which focus on producing results and lead to long lasting success. This will be backed by thematic and methodological analysis. Best practice examples are set in the background and are not so important in themselves. Expected outputs - What we want to achieve We expect various benefits: Every partner city will have designed a local action plan to strengthen social cohesion in the selected area. These plans will be of high value, because the relevant stakeholders will have taken part in it from the start and a good deal of knowledge will have been incorporated: i.e. the full support of Conet partner cities and the advice of the network´s expert. In every participating city, knowledge about new governance, in relation to integrated approaches and its impact on strengthening social cohesion in deprived areas, will be deepened and put into practice. The basics of this modern, complex and sophisticated approach and its associated know-how are transferable. This will also insure benefit to other projects. The networks between the partner cities of CoNet and the other projects in the whole Urbact network are strengthened. They are of great value too. To put it in the terminology of community development and empowerment: social and cultural capital is continuously being produced in Europe. The huge involvement of many local partners, and the impact of the European network on the public will be used to highlight concerns (especially in the political arena) which include: ¯ the necessity and chances to strengthen social cohesion ¯ and the development of new integrated approaches which have more impact and which are part of the European set of goals. Furthermore, the new promising approaches that will help us achieve the European target will be publicised, too.  
2 Preparation Phase - Our Course of Action  
CoNet’s initial project application featured the first general ideas for our exchange network. Meanwhile we used the preparation phase to further clarify the needs and goals of each partner city and to put these into focus – in relation to the working processes and methodologies of integrated approaches. Baseline Study The baseline study documentation reflects several trains of thought concerning integrated approaches and their role in strengthening social cohesion: ¯ the state of the art in the partner cities and across Europe and in the different branches of the profession. ¯ the assessment of how to further the course of action in the cities – needs and gaps. This is in relation to: ¯ the local projects, which the partner cities consider to be an important further step. ¯ the city as a whole or also even the broader levels of regional, national or European policies. The questionnaire served as a basis for the common understanding of the different local approaches and for project planning within the framework of the local action plan in each city. Most partners developed their analysis and ideas in two phases, a draft for discussion and an update following the visit of the expert and after a round-table-meeting with the local project teams or the nucleus of the future Local Support Group. Visits of the expert – Kick off in the partner cities The Lead Partner, the Berlin Senate Department for Urban Development, has appointed Prof. Dr. Rotraut Weeber as Thematic Lead Expert to support its activities over the entire duration of the project with methodological and thematic input and contributions to programme level activities. The expert visited all partner cities of the Cohesion Network: ¯ the initial five, who participated in the first application: Berlin, Liverpool, Vaulx-en-Velin, Sofia and Alba Iulia, ¯ as well as the new partner-cities, who joined during CoNet´s preparation phase (April-October 2008): Brussels, Apeldoorn, Zabrze, Malmö, Gijón and Palermo. Within the partner cities, the expert met the main stakeholders of the projects to be developed. These visits were held on-site in order to discuss their view of the specific local situation, the problems which should be tackled and the achievements already made. Following that, in nearly all cities a round-table discussion with the local project teams or the nucleus of the future Local Support Group was held and in most cases at the end of the meeting the shape of the local project became clearer. This procedure was complex and laborious, especially during summer and holiday time, but it has been very much worthwhile. It promoted dynamics to the project development and team building processes in the cities and supported the clarification of a common understanding about issues and procedures of the CoNet exchange. Questionnaire as a working tool The questionnaire was developed as a working tool, which considers the main questions of project planning – preparing the action learning and exchange of experience in the network, as well as the local projects to be elaborated.  It reflects: ¯ the local situation regarding social cohesion and the major problems to be tackled. ¯ the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, risks in the action fields of strengthening social cohesion. ¯ best practices and main questions for learning in the network. ¯ the goals, the chosen territory and the first ideas of the local project – where the local action plan will be developed. ¯ the concerns of main stakeholders and the possibilities for any future constructive work together. Project preparation - analysis At the beginning of the preparation phase, all partner cities took time to reflect on their starting situation and needs, as well as to clarify issues and objectives in relation to their CoNet project: talking in their teams, with persons of the Local Support Groups and with the expert. Some partner cities have already worked on well grounded comprehensive studies, on which they can build and which can be added to depending on the needs of the projects. At the beginning of the preparation phase, Alba Iulia started to work on an extensive study together with the university to do with social cohesion and the needs of the population. In the framework of the baseline study, we tried to get comparable statistics. This attempt was partly possible. The preparation phase at a local level is still underway and further diagnosis and needs analysis will be part of the exchange process. The formation of the Local Support Groups All the partner cities have laid the foundation of their Local Support Groups. The basis of the local project and the tasks involved as well as the possible members of the Support Group and the organisation of the meetings have all been thought over. In some cities, the nucleus of the Local Support Groups has already started working: in Berlin, Vaulx en- Velin, Liverpool, Sofia and Alba Iulia – the original first five cities that participated in the first application. The other cities, which have only had a very short time to prepare, will have their first meetings after the kick off in Berlin, using the time in between to catch up. Kick off meeting in Berlin. The Berlin kick off meeting in October 2008, with all CoNet partners, provided an excellent opportunity to get more acquainted, to exchange views and coordinate conclusions and planning schemes. The committed participation of all the partner cities was very much appreciated. Many thanks to everyone involved.  
3 Integrated Area-based Social Cohesion Policy in Europe  
3.1 Long term processes of social and urban change 20 years of integrated policies to strengthen social cohesion in neighbourhoods – and everybody is still practicing Years of area-based integrated social cohesion policies in Europe and everybody is still learning and practicing - that is not astonishing, but necessary. Far-reaching changes in thinking and acting are involved – Cities in Europe are working on long term processes of societal change. This is based on a new understanding of social and urban development, so fundamental that we may even speak of a paradigm shift. Three aspects form the focus: 
3.1.1 Social Cohesion More inclusion in all important fields of life – involvement and proactiveness of citizens. Multidimensional understanding of poverty Elimination of poverty is a central aspect of social cohesion. But the poor are not only those who do not have money – the poor are those, who have so little economic, cultural and social means, that they are excluded from a normal (minimum) social life in society. This modern definition of poverty explains, that more is needed than giving money, alimony or maintenance. We know – and it is well proven – that the causes of exclusion are highly interconnected. Accordingly interactions are important: social deprivation in different fields of life enhances each other. It is obvious that an integrated approach to tackle poverty will be more successful. Inclusion and an open society – Accessibility of public amenities and social life. Talking about inclusion, as opposed to mere material or physical poverty, changes the approach in another important way: Inclusion is a two-sided active process. Society must also be open and supportive to let disadvantaged people in, so the cities target to strengthen the accessibility of education, social and cultural life, the accessibility of public amenities etc. This is not only a question of formal opportunities, but of attitudes and images as well. Preconditions of inclusion are tolerance and reduced prejudices against minorities. Low opinions of social groups or even disdain are crucial barriers to inclusion. The most difficult part in strengthening social inclusion is to change mentality in these aspects.  Inhabitants’ involvement and proactiveness On the other hand, everybody – also the disadvantaged - should be active citizens and should be supported in this role. To develop their goals and projects from the bottom up and to enable people to decide their matters themselves are two aspects of real involvement. It is a long learning process – often to be repeated – that must be based on respect and recognition. The beneficiaries need to take an active part, otherwise help will prove mostly to be unsuccessful. Thus, an often occurring problem is caused by professionals’ lack of consciousness: ""We do so much for them, but they don't appreciate it"". Also in social work, it proved to be worthwhile to focus on the strengths and not primarily on the weaknesses. To summarise: People should not be the object of care and top down developed projects and decisions. They should be considered as actors, who do a lot for managing and deciding their own matters. Thus, giving support to proactive citizens is an important part of help. 
3.1.2 Integrated Approaches and New Urban Governance New forms of urban governance have been developed and should further be developed to increase the governing capacity of cities and to cope with the changing of society. Integrated policies at the local and project level are only possible by introducing a new form of governance. In doing so it widens the attention – to take into account the wider configuration of state, markets and civil society. Integrated urban policies are area based: they reflect the complexity of urban life in contrast to sector-based traditional administration. The policy making thus becomes more bottom-up and less top-down. This is a huge step to make. The word governance means the processes of steering and decision-making and the processes by which decisions are implemented (or not)1. It focuses on the formal and informal structures and on the formal and informal actors involved to arrive at and implement a decision. At this point it should be noted that governance is a current English and French buzzword. However, in many other languages, there is no counterpart of this expression, which exists. The most important point of new governance is to make an effort to strengthen cooperation and participation. Administration, those in politics, investors, citizens, state, municipalities, social organisations and other stakeholders should act together. It is especially important that citizens themselves – the beneficiaries - should have a direct role in finding solutions to their own problems. The empowerment of groups of people who are not used to participating and who have not yet learned to bring up their own interests is a corner stone of the new approach. Often these groups are women, young people, migrants, the poor and less educated.  Governance in the wider picture There are three further reasons in wider discussion why the word governance has become a trendy term since the late 1980's. They are also connected to new governance in area based development. Good governance Bad governance is one of the main causes of misery and poverty – this was emphasised by the World Bank in the 'The Political Risk Yearbook 1989, Sub- Saharan Africa'. The push for good governance became a central focus of development policies. The developed characteristics and ranking systems of good governance had a growing impact on further decisions. Private and public enterprises, professional associations and other parties are also discussing their general values. They try to come to agreement as to what good governance means in their fields in the hope this will contribute to better rules and relations. Competitiveness Globalisation enforces world–wide competition, also between cities and regions. In order to strengthen their competitiveness and to attract investments they also change their traditional kind of governance. Ideas and expectations about how municipalities should act have shifted. Expectations are for example: ¯ provide more room for private initiatives, both commercial and charitable, ¯ to seize opportunities, to negotiate to reach the best offer for the city, ¯ to give incentives and support to innovative processes, ¯ to enforce big investments with public-private partnerships, ¯ to diminish bureaucratic and public regulations and to build more on the proactiveness and responsibilities of the people involved. All these new ideas are highly controversial, but the fact is, that governance of communities has become much more complex with municipalities taking on an ever increasing role of mediation. The European City The active and important role of the citizen is part of European tradition and still has a clear presence in many cities. The pride of citizenship can be seen in many old town halls and market places across the continent. The identification of the citizens with their city becomes fact when people maintain social, cultural and political initiatives for the benefit of the city and the social cohesion in the city. Many influences increase the risk, that these long standing ideals could be undermined - suburbanisation, migration, progress of social security by big anonymous systems (which include the risk that local initiatives seem to be unnecessary), consumer culture and so on. In several aspects citizens, professionals and politicians are working on a renaissance of the European city2: moving back into the centre of the city, preserving the historical memory and identity, strengthening participation of the citizens. 
3.1.3 Integrated approaches in disadvantaged neighbourhoods Large and strong social networks in the neighbourhood benefit individuals as well as the wider community make an effort to strengthen cooperation and participation. Administration, those in politics, investors, citizens, state, municipalities, social organisations and other stakeholders should act together. It is especially important that citizens themselves – the beneficiaries - should have a direct role in finding solutions to their own problems. The empowerment of groups of people who are not used to participating and who have not yet learned to bring up their own interests is a corner stone of the new approach. Often these groups are women, young people, migrants, the poor and less educated. Territory - framework for integrated action. To strengthen social cohesion in an area-based approach is of special importance to deprived neighbourhoods. The pressure to act and to have success is especially high where social, economic and physical disadvantages are concentrated. This supports the integrated approach. ¯ The needs and the benefits of cooperation, cross sectorial and public private partnership are particularly obvious in the real world contact of people and projects. ¯ The visibility of actions and results can be high, if they are locally concentrated. It is easier to exceed the critical amount of improvement. ¯ The common interest of well-being in the neighbourhood is a chance for the mobilisation of partners. ¯ Very different stakeholders have similar interests, which encourage them to work together and to produce synergies. ¯ Last but not least: The concrete task in a specific location is a first class experimental field – with more freedom of trial and error and a lot of opportunities for implementing innovative approaches. Of course after so many years of effort, nobody overestimates the impact of policies which try to solve the problems of social exclusion and poverty within only particular areas. Current attempts try to have better synergies of general, regional and local policies – to act not only from the bottom up, but with simultaneous harmonised top down acting. To support inclusion – Developing social and cultural capital Why so much focus on enhancing people’s involvement and participation especially in disadvantaged areas? In middle or upper class districts there is often less of it and it is not seen to be a problem – so why? This is often asked. The criticism of communitarist thinkers, who put much importance on community life and community involvement, is that these ideas are based on wishful thinking. But the reason for participation is not only the usefulness of the expertise of the people themselves and the needs of democracy. In these communities it is especially essential to build social networks and people's know-how to invest in their own interests – in other words to develop social and cultural capital. The sociologists Pierre Bourdieu (France) and Robert D. Putnam (USA) describe in their research and theories the importance of social and cultural capital; while Bourdieu focuses on the benefits to individuals, Putnam emphasises the benefits to the community. Social capital is seen as an important indicator of social cohesion3, in the wider sense of keeping society together. Important aspects of social capital are: ¯ involvement in associations and the public sphere, ¯ relations with friends, families and acquaintances, ¯ trust in fellow-citizens and institutions, ¯ a feeling of security and a sense of belonging. In disadvantaged neighbourhoods social and cultural capital is very much needed. People here are much more personally affected by economic globalisation, the increasing risk of unemployment and poverty, growing social and cultural diversity and exclusion. But social and cultural capital, which is needed to cope with these difficult living conditions is often less existent in these areas. In his studies4 Putnam claims that ethnic diversity reduces solidarity, social capital, trust in one’s neighbour, community cooperation, and having friends. So in multicultural areas an enhanced effort is needed to strengthen social networks and community life. This is an important approach to sustain and strengthen mixed neighbourhoods and to fight ghettoisation, which constitutes an important aspect in regeneration strategies across Europe. Another aspect has to be noted: In their every-day life it is people in the deprived areas who create integration for the entire city, not the people in the segregated upper class areas. So it is only fair that these efforts should have the best support: with the best schools, space for children's and youths activities, a colourful neighbourhood life ect. – all these efforts are also measures against further segregation  
CoNet in short.  
Urbact – European Network CoNet: Exploring current approaches to strengthen social cohesion in neighbourhoods Within the framework of Urbact, eleven European cities have joined to form CoNet – the social cohesion network. They exchange experience on how to better realise current integrated approaches in order to strengthen social cohesion in deprived neighbourhoods – especially in the fields of employment, education and neighbour-hood life. It is hoped that this knowledge will evolve into innovative projects in each of the partner cities. Integrated projects allow greater progress to be made: all stakeholders are involved, the citizens participate actively, and projects contributing to different aims and functions are bundled. The opportunities offered by the use of integrated approaches have by no means been exhausted. Yet this is an important tool in the successful and sustainable fight against the increasing segregation and social polarisation faced by our cities. Berlin initiated the network in 2008 and will coordinate it for the next two and a half years. The other members of the network are Liverpool (UK), Vaulx-en-Velin (FR), Sofia (BG), Alba Iulia (RO), Brussels (BE), Apeldoorn (NL), Zabrze (PL), Malmö (SE), Gijón (ES) and Palermo (IT). As the network's Lead Expert, Prof. Dr. Rotraut Weeber will support the project with methodological and thematic input. Furthermore, in collaboration with the partner cities, she authored the Baseline Study. In Europe, these approaches of broadened cooperation and more intensive civil participation are currently being discussed under the term ‘new governance’. How to motivate stakeholders? How to steer the process? How to make decisions? How to actually get things done? These key methodological questions form the focus of the CoNet exchange. In improving the social stabilisation of deprived neighbourhoods it is especially worth applying and optimising these new approaches. However, there are also many associated unique questions and challenges that arise when putting these approaches into practice – particularly in the fields of employment, education, neighbourhood life and civil participation.

"Introduction  
This report summarize the work undertaken by the thematic network on Creative Clusters in Low Density Urban Areas during the so-called first phase of development, from April to October 2008, under the framework of the URBACT II Programme. Once the final partnership of the network, lead by the city of Óbidos, has been completed along this phase, this study will be the starting point for the activities of the network established in the ad hoc work programme for the second phase or implementation phase. The URBACT network on Creative Clusters in Low-Density Urban Areas is an added value cooperation project with the goal to perform a collective “learning by doing” exercise in the field of urban creative clusters. The fundamental assumption is that creative issues in local economic development are also a functional pattern outside the context of the main urban hubs and core cities. Even more, creativity as source of innovation should act as a cross cutting approach to re-think economic and social development in middle size and small towns given the new opportunities related to accessibility, community life, culture an so on. According to the programme guidelines, this baseline study consists of three main chapters: _ An assessment on the state of the art, particularly at European level, on the topic of urban creative clusters. A systematic review of the existing knowledge, key findings, policy actions and the most remarkable experiences. _ The partner profiles for better understanding different starting situations, ways of approaching the project theme and expectations on the final goals of the cooperation process. Mainly this short analysis is based in the study visit and the completion of a questionnaire as an internal template to tell each local story [see on annex]. Generally these profiles cover the spatial context, main economic challenges, assets and city background on the issue of creative clusters, main gaps, on-going projects and main expectations as regards the forthcoming local action plan dealing with the creative issue as well as the preliminary composition of their local support groups. _ Finally, a synthesis bringing together the issues arising from analysis of the situation in the partner cities with the State of the Art, resulting in a clear definition of the theoretical framework, a selection of a limited number of preferential sub-themes and the basis for focused and straight local action plans.  
THE MEANING OF CREATIVITY IN SPATIAL DEVELOPMENT | THE CREATIVE ECOSYSTEM 
 The importance of creativity has emerged as an essential resource to be competitive in the global world. Nowadays, creativity together with innovation and knowledge [the immaterial component of society] are differentiating factors that influence ideas, products, services and places leading to competitive advantages in all fields of economy. The “Economy of Culture in Europe” report [European Commission, 2006] 1 states that “Creativity is a complex process of innovation, combining some or all of the following dimensions: ideas, skills, technology, management, production processes as well as culture. Creativity has the ability to benefit almost all economic sectors.” In this context, the concept of creative ecosystem recently posed by the Portuguese think tank on spatial development INTELI it is very useful. The creative ecosystem is an environment of excellence focused on creativity. It comprises: creative people (creative class and entrepreneurs), creative economy (creative industries and clusters) and creative places (creative districts and cities). It is supported by specific creative policies (European, national, regional and local strategies) towards sustainable creative frameworks. 
POLICIES | CREATIVE STRATEGIES 
Concepts such as “creative economy”, “creative cities” [intelligent, innovative or learning cities] and “creative industries” have been increasingly present both in academic literature as well as in national, European and international public policies. In fact, international and European institutions like European Commission, OECD, UNCTAD or WIPO [World Intellectual Property Organization] have been widely recognizing the importance of creativity to economic development, such as: • The OECD published in 2005 the report “Culture and Local Development” showing how public policies can foster culture as a lever for local economic development in terms of partnerships, tax relief, and other innovative instruments. • In 2008, United Nations Conference on Trade and Development [UNCTAD] has published a report on Creative Economy2, expressing its vision about the subject. • The European Commission made public in 2006 the report “The Economy of Culture in Europe” 3 stressing the importance of the creative and cultural industries in Europe in terms of employment and GDP. • Currently, the EC is preparing the report “The Impact of Culture on Creativity” in the context of the 1999 European Year on Creativity and Innovation” 4, to be published in February 2009.  
PEOPLE | CREATIVE CLASS
 Human capital and talent are becoming the driving forces to achieve economic growth in the knowledge and creative economy, and the ability of attract and retain them builds regional competitive advantages. Florida and Tinagli (2004) 6 advocated that “The winners and losers in the global creative economy will be those nations that are best able to attract, retain, and develop creative talent and harness their creative assets and capabilities.” Creative people or “creative class” 7 generate economic, social and cultural dynamism as well as have the capacity to create new ideas, new technologies and new content adding economic value through creativity. Creative people refer to people who work on science, engineering, architecture, design, arts, music, entertainment, etc. For Richard Florida the creative class also includes creative professionals in business, finance and law. Creative people and talents are attracted to environments characterized by openness, a diverse and inclusive community and the existence of abundant and vibrant high quality experiences. They look for urban diversity, in spatial, social and economic terms, local uniqueness and community involvement. Different segments of creative people search for different types of environments, for instance, students are attracted for cheap accommodation, prestigious universities, life style environments, etc. in contrast with creative people related to the media sector whose interests remain on urban diversity, creative spaces, cultural agendas, an son on. In this context, the notion of creative entrepreneurs is also emerging. They are creative practitioners with the capacity to turn ideas into creative products and services for society. Their creativity surpass the artistic sphere; their entrepreneurial vision allows them to identify new opportunities in the marketplace, using business skills to transform ideas into products and into profits. 
ECONOMY | CREATIVE INDUSTRIES
 As creativity, innovation and knowledge are becoming the main drivers of economic development of cities and regions, a new creative economy is emerging: “In the contemporary world, a new development paradigm is emerging that links the economy and culture, embracing economic, cultural, technological and social aspects of development at both the macro and micro level. Central to the new paradigm is the fact that creativity, knowledge and access to information are increasingly recognized as powerful engines driving economic growth and promoting development in a globalizing world.” [UNCTAD, 2008]. At the heart of the creative economy are the creative industries. The concept of creative industries includes a diverse range of businesses in sectors where talent and individual creativity are the key factors of production and where the idea of business is crucial. The products and services resulting from creative industries have their value in creative, innovative and artistic attributes. This kind of industry is based on creative individuals in association with managers and technologists. This industry is simultaneously art, science and business. The concept of creative industries is broader than the cultural industries notion, encompassing not only creative contents with cultural and intangible nature but also other products and advanced services with a significant creative and innovative component, covering other sectors such as: Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), fashion, design, video, photography, cinema, computer games, architecture, visual arts, advanced services, etc. The concept of creative industries emerged in the 1990s, through the Department of Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) of the UK government. Its first report (8) integrates a definition of creative industries which is still used and very popular: “activities which have their origin in individual creativity skill and talent and which have the potential for wealth and job creation through the generation and exploitation of intellectual property”. However, this notion is not generally accepted and at least two additional different models can be identified in Europe (European Commission, 2006, cited here). On one hand, the French approach carried out by the “Département des Etudes de la Prospective et des Statistiques” (9) defined creative industries as “a set of economic activities that ally conception, creation, and production functions to more industrial functions of manufacturing and commercialising at large scale, through the use of material supports or communication technologies.” In comparison with other definitions this approach doesn’t take into account education activities, press critic activities, or the activities of collective management societies. In contrast with the UK approach which is one of the widest definitions. On the other, the Nordic approach, which is derived from the concept of an emerging “experience economy” based on staging experiences, is related with everything that is considered as such by the consumer. In addition to the scope of the UK “creative industries” it also includes toys/amusement, tourism, sport, and edutainment. Creative clusters generally emerge organically in specific urban frameworks through relations of production, work, research, education, entertainment and leisure. Therefore, this type of clusters has particular characteristics, originating dynamic and distinctive urban areas as places to live, work, learn and play with a 24/7 life style. Creative clusters can be promoted in a top-down approach by national, regional or local authorities who recognize the importance of their development or can emerge spontaneously in a bottom-up approach.  PLACES | CREATIVE CITIES Creativity has strong relations with territories and places. Creative workers look for places with particular environments, distinctive and diverse urban contexts favourable to creation and innovation. Increasingly cities and regions are competing to attract and retain not only companies but talents. To promote creative clusters, cities need to ensure specific amenities to provide the needs of the creative industries such as flexibility, networking and high concentration of creative talented people. In the above mentioned report “Europe in the Creative Age” (2004) Florida and Irene Tinagli rated countries on the basis of their Euro-Creativity Trend Index. The best performers on this account at Country level were Ireland, Finland, Portugal, Denmark, Spain, Greece, Sweden, Belgium and Austria. Therefore, cities should encompass particular features namely, cultural amenities, high-tech facilities, healthy places and a diverse and international atmosphere. 
CREATIVE CLUSTERS IN LOW DENSITY URBAN AREAS | THE ULTIMATE DEBATE IN LOCAL DEVELOPMENT 
Both in academic literature and in EU and national policies and strategic documents, creative clusters are considered as viable only in big cities, due to the concentration of human, economic and institutional resources in these main urban nodes. However, creativity can act as a driving force for the development of small urban centres even as a driver to re-think rural development, combating the desertification and exodus of population to core and large cities. Thus, the presence and the role of creative clusters and talents in low density zones need to be more widely acknowledged and better understood in order to pursue innovation policies and strategies aimed at developing small economies. Creative people live mostly in big urban centres, but are also attracted to small and low density environments characterized by the presence of endogenous assets, such as natural-rural and historical-cultural amenities and by a good and healthy quality of life. These types of low density urban areas can attract especially talented young families, midlife career changers, active retirees and others in order to create a talent base. Small creative businesses in the areas of design, crafts, art and antiques market, music, advertising, architecture, etc. are the result of the active entrepreneurial spirit of these talented people who want to live, work, learn and play in these communities. Therefore, as expected, places with a higher concentration of creative occupations tend to have more creative activities. Furthermore, creative industries provide a range of innovative inputs and knowledge spillovers to traditional sectors of rural and small economies: tourism, crafts, agriculture, gastronomy, textiles, furniture, etc., promoting their development and prosperity. INTELI, a think tank on innovative spatial development based in Lisbon [www.inteli.pt], has proposed a conceptual model for a better understanding of how creative clusters in low density urban areas can be developed. This model will be a suitable framework of the URBACT thematic network on this issue. Small urban centres with particular amenities should transform themselves into communities to live, work, learn and play - into “creative places”. They are characterized by important natural-rural and cultural historical assets and by constructed amenities, such as arts and cultural facilities. Concerning the natural-rural assets one can point the climate, landscapes… the physical and human geography. In what concerns historical-cultural amenities, there are the material and the intangible heritages such as memories and traditions. These amenities induce quality of life, symbolic capital and place identity. Regarding the built amenities, there can be knowledge infrastructures, arts and cultural facilities, live-work houses, creative incubators, temporary creative events, etc. These assets create diversity, a vibrant environment and a mix of lifestyles. It is also important to stress that small towns with good accessibilities are most likely to be creative class magnets. Nowadays, the accessible-remote duality is more relevant than the urban-rural one. Accessibility is a key. Consequently, the proximity of an urban centre is essential for a polycentric spatial development. Low density urban areas should base their development strategy on the attraction and retention of talents and on the promotion of creative entrepreneurship, in coherence with their historical path, characteristics, dominant players, identity, etc. Local and municipal policies have a role to fulfill, promoting strategies oriented to the attraction and retention of creative talents; enhancement of creative entrepreneurship; promotion of creative and cultural industries; creation of cultural and artistic facilities; launching of events, fairs, exhibitions and workshops; and promotion of creative urban regeneration. These development strategies represent a mix of history and technology; tradition and innovation. The human habitat is related with the endogenous characteristics of the city, town or village, regarding its places (built environment); community (social interactions); and environment (natural assets). Places or the built environment is an important component to attract creative clusters, encompassing architecture of the place, the urban landscape and image, the public spaces, and other tangible aspects of an urban framework. Community or social interactions is the component related with the local population who live and work in towns and midsize cities, and who gives the social atmosphere of the place. The environment or natural assets of the place is another crucial dimension to attract and retain creative talents based on the natural landscape as well as the climate, biodiversity, etc. Regarding the Cultural and Economic framework is associated with what creativity and culture can enable over the Human Habitat, through the attraction of creative people (entrepreneurs), creative activities and events (culture, leisure and education) and creative economy (creative industries). The connectivity dimension is a critical driver for success of creative urban contexts since it fosters cooperation between creative workers, activities, resources and territories. This dimension encompasses both virtual (digital communications) and physical accessibilities. 
Synthesis: approaching the implementation phase 
MAIN ASSUMPTIONS | THE CREATIVE ISSUE AS A KEY DRIVER FOR NEW STRATEGIES IN LOCAL DEVELOPMENT 
From the creative class to creative clusters | from creative clusters to the creative place In the creative economy, regional advantage comes to places that can quickly mobilize the talent, resources, and capabilities required to turn innovations into new business ideas and commercial products. Leading regions establish competitive advantage through their capabilities. They are vehicles for mobilization that can almost instantaneously bring together the resources required to launch new activities and turn innovations into successful products, For these reasons, the nexus of competitive advantage shifts to those regions that can generate, retain, and attract the best talent. This is particularly true because creative workers are extremely mobile and the distribution of talent is highly skewed 13. This general assumption rapidly diffused due to the successful work of Richard Florida has re-shaped many working agendas in urban economic development around the World, especially in the OECD context. This vision [strongly based on the seminal work of Jane Jacobs in the 60`s about the role of the community life] leverages another key ideas resulting all in a new relevance on the creative issue as a cross cutting driver or inspiring idea to inform a new generation of local economic development strategies. Some of these key ideas are: 1. The fact that new emergent productive realities, creativity-based and cluster-based, are growing in importance. For instance the so-called TIME cluster: Technology, Information, Media, Entertainment. It means that the creative class is much more than artists and people from the cultural word, including professionals, tech-people or scientists. Moreover we are in front of a powerful source of a new kind on innovation that in most cases remains ‘hidden’ at the light of traditional innovation indicators as the think tank NESTA has reported on a research on five British creative industries [videogames, product design, advertising and broadcast production] 14. It means that creative activities usually act as a more relevant actor diffusing innovation than we think, and this fact has important consequences in term of spatial development. 2. In the new theory of business management, creativity is a new driver for facing growth in every business, once knowledge has been already assume as a crucial factor. A recent report commissioned by the British HM Treasury stated the ""the intelligent application of creativity and design allows businesses of all sizes to access new, global markets by increasing the distinctiveness of products and services and competing on the basis of the added value of their unique appeal to consumers"". 15 A proof on how the creative issue is re-shaping the agenda on spatial economic development is the comprehensive paper edited this year by the director of EURADA [European Association of Development Agencies] Christian Saublens 16. However, we all should take care about approaching the Florida ideas in a simplistic way, the ultimate mixtification in local development. Nobody well informed can take the “three T model” as a truly urban theory, although as inspiring idea is very useful to refresh urban policy. 17 In fact, the success of the creative issue in business and in local development is an answer for placing people at the core. Analyzing amongst our partnership the real motivation why theses cities want to participate in a project on creative clusters, the answers vary significantly and not always are strictly related to the impulse of a business cluster in new emergent tech. or cultural based activities. So, one key assumption is to frame the creative issue in a local development model that not necessarily has to be labeled as “creative”. Ones refer to local smart growth 18. Here labels do not matter, what matter is to put people and spatial functionality at the core. Anyway, it is clear that a strong leadership and an ambitious vision are key conditions to promote creative clusters and the creative city. Finally, the main added value that the work of this URBAC network can produce is to transfer the “creative city model” [too much focused on big and middle-sized metropolis - Barcelona, Dublin… Singapore] to low-density urban areas. In other words, to transfer a range of so far considered urban attributes [accessibility, cultural life, tech. facilities, competitive clusters, global networking…] to middle-sized and small towns. This is relevant at EU level because we are going to explore the capacity of the creative issue to impulse a sort of leapfrog in terms of social and economic development for small and midsize towns as well as an excellent opportunity to re-think rural development. From the geographical point of view we are no going to handle with the duality urban-rural in our URBACT cooperation project. In this framework “low density urban areas” matches with: i) the OCED concept of “intermediate region”; and ii) the remoteness/proximity duality, in fact accessibility to a main urban hub. Amongst the urban and the rural OCED has introduced a third category of “intermediate” regions. “Regions that are neither rural nor urban and which are composed of small and medium-sized towns - are a vital component of regional and local development. They provide a link between urban and rural areas and local and international economies. But these regions of potential economic importance often fall between the cracks when planners and legislators are drawing up development strategies”. So, remoteness/proximity to an urban centre is a main criteria to place a geographical area in the “intermediate” category 19. Thus, a region is considered close to a city if more than half of its residents can drive to the centre of a city of at least 50.000 inhabitants within 45 minutes. 
MAIN SUB-THEMES TO BE TACKLED BY THE URBACT THEMATIC NETWORK
 At the beginning of the Development phase a working agenda was set up covering eight main topics on promoting creative clusters at local level: _ Talented people: attraction & retaining. _ Promoting quality of life. _ A new cluster reading for local economies. _ A new range of facilities and infrastructures. _ Vibrant cultural agendas as catalysts. _ Financial support measures for creative entrepreneurs. _ Public agencies and other useful tools. _ Branding the creative place. A new cluster reading of local economies In the last years research, cooperation projects and position and policy papers regarding cluster development initiatives have increased in number significantly. As a consequence cluster development policies are mainstream at EU, national and regional levels as well as in the case of large urban centres 20. However, frequently it has not happened in the case of middle sized towns. Europe has strong competitive advantages in sectors of creative industry that include: Luxury goods (perfumes, eyewear, watchmaking, leather goods, etc.); Fashion (clothing, footwear, etc.); Automobile design and household furniture; Tableware; Software in some areas (3D CAD-CAM); High-speed rail; Racing, sports and luxury cars; Architecture; Gastronomy; Diesel engines; Aerospace; Design tools (software); or Cultural tourism [Saublens, C. 2008]. A new cluster reading of the local economic base [no matter what dimension of the local economy] has to be seen as a refreshing exercise to re-think urban economy in order to: i) identify and impulse new emergent realities [the cases of Reggio Emilia and Barnsley on new media clusters]; ii) and/or to activate new growth potential in existing industries [Mizil, Enguera in eco-tourism or Hódmez_vásárhely with its tradition in ceramics]. Both kind of processes will be of great relevance within the partnership work along the implementation phase. Therefore will be crucial the understanding of what a cluster development process is, incorporating recent background at EU level. Talented people: attraction & retaining Creative environments do not deal just with creative entrepreneurs but in a wider sense with creative people. Non entrepreneurs but creative professionals are looking for creative and intelligent organizations. Maybe the most interesting chapter in the Florida´s best seller (2002) is the one entitled “life in the horizontal labour market”. “people don´t stay tied to companies anymore; instead of moving up through the ranks of one organization, they move laterally from company to company in search of what they want”. Now the retention of talent is a key issue in business management. We need creative big and medium-sized organizations in our local economies if we want to face the challenge of building a creative place. It is clear that mobility is leading to an increasing level of labour-market internationalisation and integration, and competition for talent is now influencing innovation policy initiatives across the globe. 22 On a credible basis, combining a smart city branding and communication strategy together with a set of relocation incentives, a creative midsize city could attract and retain creative class, besides its local talent. Promoting quality of life The creative city deals with placing people at the core. Concerning the new creative class, creative entrepreneurs and smart organizations it means to match their locational factors. A few come from the past experience in the 80´s with the appearance of sun-belt tech-regions [Texas, California, French Riviera…] and the technological park booming. Most of them are quite new: • Hyper-accessibility, what does not mean to live near an international airport but to get easy access to it by train or highway. • Fuzzy borders between work and leisure, between the working space and the private space. • Easy access to housing. • Environmental friendly local policies: fight against noise, pollution and urban speculation. • Networking facilities is essential in the era of the wikieconomies: massive access to ADSL or Internet broad band. • Education local systems, not just thinking of the expatriates´ sons but in the incubation of the local talented people of the future. Like in business in local economic development size does not matter but isolation. A new range of facilities and infrastructures The enhancing of cultural life and the emergence of new creative clusters demands a new generation of business and city facilities, even a new kind of urban public spaces, at different scales: from creative hubs or cultural districts [in many cases as a gentrification process in deprived central areas] to art incubators, artists´ residencies, design centres, centres for the commercialization of intellectual property [Wales], etc. Vibrant cultural agendas as catalysts A continuous improvement of the cultural life and agenda is a good sign to recognize the creative place. Trying to move from the seasonal events to a day-to-day cultural environment. To create an attractive city brand for the creative class is not a matter of huge marketing campaigns like the ones from Dubai or the Gulf Countries. Sometimes the strategy is the promotion of a creative event, with high credibility, an event that quickly expands through the word-of-mouth. Financial support measures for creative entrepreneurs The proposal concerning the “Small Business Act”, adopted by the European Commission on 25 June 2008 is a unique opportunity to take a step forward for matching with specific characteristics of the micro and small businesses, the majority of the creative start-ups. Anyway, there is a role to play by the local level [the creative cluster manager or the creative city] providing specific support tools to creative entrepreneurs and business [also using funding schemes from national and European level]: _ Tax reductions [Tax Free Óbidos], real estate facilities and other measures organized in “welcome packages”. _ Financial tools covering intangible assets. _ Support to networking activities and the creation of the economies of scope within the creative company. _ Support to the recruitment of skilled labour force in the companies. _ Venture capital systems [or effective linkages to business angel networks], operating in every scale are an important tool promoting a creative environment. Anyway, cities should take one step beyond creating new financial support tools adapted to creative start-ups. Public agencies and other useful tools Although there is still much to do as regards the institutionalization of local development in Europe [just see the Mizil, Enguera or even Reggio Emilia cases], this theme is basically related to specific agencies and bodies devoted to creative clusters. Here the United Kingdom is clearly the benchmark with a lot of cases such as CIDA, the Creative Industries Development Agency, in Northern England [www.cida.org] or the Cultural Industries Quarter Agency, CIQA, [www.ciq.org.uk], in Sheffield and surroundings. There also are other stimulating platforms like the Intellectual Assets Centre in Scotland [www.ia-centre.org.uk] aimed at the development of the intangibles in businesses and organizations. Nevertheless, in many contexts it could be enough a local development agency with a straight vision and an updated working agenda in economic development, commitment from the local private sector, effective linkages with the urban physical planning and a strong leadership from the local government. 25 Branding the creative place Branding and communication should be a link in the chain of a creativity-based local strategy not the starting point. Credibility is a key-word in this kind of public performance. Much more, branding should be approached as a process aimed at the production of a new visibility of the city, a sort of re-thinking the local identity. 26 Now the trend is to mix the attributes of a functional business place with the attributes of a unique urban experience. The Seville [Spain] and Turin [Italy] cases are very significant. From very different starting points, Seville a vibrant city associated to sun and flamenco, and Turin associated to production and car industry, both are trying to converge in the same middle point. The first one with a campaign entitle “Seville, a place in business” and Torino with the motto “Passion lives here”. Networking strategies at city-city level are extremely useful in a framework of promoting creative clusters. It is a rapid way to set up interchange programmes related to cultural production, creative people and creative businesses. At the end of the Development phase and as a result of the work with each of the city partners during the study visits and further discussion with them on the approach for Local Action Plans and future expectations, this preliminary battery of eight topics were reviewed and re-arranged resulting on five key sub-themes finally. _ Creative clusters: diversifying local economic base & opportunities to young people The partnership will face not only the impulse of new emergent clusters in creative industries but also to use the creative issue to re-think some mature local industries in order to foster them with a new growth potential, with a special reference to tourism. Also, the challenge of job creation and employment opportunities especially for young local people will be a important issue to deal with during the implementation phase. _ Events and cultural agendas as catalysts Culture and cultural life as key ingredients for addressing the creative city. A common assumption within the whole partnership is to blur the limits between the cultural and the economic development policies at the urban scale. _ Promoting the creative city: a new range of facilities and infrastructures This will be the more physical dimension of the work of the partnership. Different scales will be considered: from adapting public spaces and city centres to creative activities [where the mixing of land-uses is crucial as opposite to the past zoning schemes], cultural districts… always placing people at the core, to a new generation of facilities to creative business and entrepreneurs. Here the potential role of the associated Managing Authorities participating in the ad-hoc financial schemes for this kind of local investment will be crucial. _ Creative entrepreneurs and talented people: attraction and retaining Packaging financial and advising support measures specifically adapted to creative entrepreneurs and businesses. Branding the creative place will be considered here as a framework for a smart and focused diffusion of these support tools. _ Setting the basis: creative education environments at local levels We have noticed during the Development phase that many of the cities approaching seriously the creative paradigm, they are displaying innovative and creative local education systems in primary and secondary levels. In this field Reggio Emilia is an international bechmark at World level, but also Óbidos or Barnsley are active introducing advanced methods in public education. It is relevant to diffuse these practices to the whole partnership. 
LOCAL ACTION PLANS AND THE CREATION OF A FUNCTIONAL FRAMEWORK FOR COLLECTIVE LEARNING 
The whole Creative Cluster partnership recognizes the following three elements as the key components for the implementation phase within the URBACT II programme network: _ Participation of the main stakeholders on the Local Support Groups. In most of the city partners a kick-off session of the LSG has already been place. _ Pragmatism, with the elaboration of Local Action Plans. What means to foster on-going experiences and shape future expectations with a real leadership from the local governments. The Local Action Plans will be the tangible results at local scale during the implementation phase. Nevertheless, LAPs do not have to be a final gooal by themselves but a straight and durable vision on urban creativity for each of the city partners. The project should be considered as an inspiring process for catalizing and supporting a new innovation way in the form middle size towns are approaching economic development. _ Financing, getting some kind of involvement from the associated Managing Authorities, as well as other regional or national development bodies or public organizations regarding creative industries and clusters.

CREATIVE SpIN

Introduction.

The Creative SpIN project (2012-2015) was supported by URBACT, a European Programme aiming at fostering the exchange of experience among European cities and the capitalisation-dissemination of knowledge on all issues related to sustainable urban development.
The objective of the project was to define and test tools and methods to connect culture and creative Industries (CCIs) with other sectors of the economy in order to stimulate “creative spill-overs” and contribute to innovation. Its ultimate purpose was to trigger creativity in businesses and organisations by encouraging artists, creative professionals as well as cultural and creative industries to engage with other sectors to share their competences, creativity, skills and services.
Creative SpIN’s fundamental assumption is that culture-based creativity is a key source of innovation in the context of the new economy, very much led by symbolic, immaterial and emotional values. Culture-based creativity is linked to the ability of people, notably artists, to think imaginatively or metaphorically, to challenge the conventional, and to call on the symbolic and affective to communicate and innovate.
The project gathered nine partners: Birmingham City Council, Lead Partner; Bologna City Council; Essen City Council; Kortrijk City Council; Košice 2013 European Capital of Culture; Mons City Council; Óbidos City Council; Rotterdam City Council; and Tallinn Creative Hub. Creative SpIN’s cities were accompanied and assisted by a Lead Expert (Philippe Kern, founder and Managing Director of KEA) throughout the entire project.
Through the exchange of knowledge and practices, Creative SpIN’s partners have been able to better grasp the creative spill-over concept and the role of cities in setting up the right ecosystem identify potential complementarities between culture and targeted economic sectors (ICT, tourism, education, manufacturing, urban development, and health), as well as identify tools and processes to support cross-sectoral collaborations. Local Action Plans have also been developed to test such tools and stimulate creative spill-over actions, as a follow-up to the project.
This Final Report aims at presenting the main outcomes of Creative SpIN. It starts with the presentation of the socioeconomic context that explains the need of such a project and then moves to a detailed presentation of the project, its main achievements and leaning points. Practical examples and case studies, taken both from Creative SpIN’s partners and other sources, are presented throughout the report, to concretely illustrate the innovation potential of creative spill-overs. Main conclusions and policy recommendations are presented in the last chapter.

2. CONTEXT & CONCEPTS
2.1. THE NEW ECONOMY REQUIRES INNOVATION
Today’s post-industrial economy is led by innovation, be it technological or non-technological.
Whilst in the XXth century innovation was mainly called upon to improve productivity, today innovation is of paramount importance, both to improve productivity (e.g. process innovation) and to help companies differentiate from competitors (e.g. new branding strategy or innovative products/experiences) in order to succeed in an increasingly globalised, fast-paced and competitive economic arena.
The new economy is characterised by:
• Speed in the production and consumption;
• Customisation/individualisation of the product offer
requiring differentiation (often though better
design, aesthetic, branding);
• Prevalence of intangible values (aesthetic, brands,
design, meanings…) that are increasingly given as
much importance as the functionality of the product: the cultural or creative value of a product becomes as important as its economic value;
• Experiential values that are considered increasingly
important, both at the demand and supply side1;
• New social trends where people attach as much or
more importance to sharing, than to owning.
Culture-based creativity is an essential feature of this new economy.
This is linked to the ability of people, notably artists and creative professionals, to think imaginatively or metaphorically, to challenge the conventional, and to call on the symbolic and affective to communicate.
Culture-based creativity has the capacity to break conventions, the usual way of thinking, to allow the development of a new vision, idea or product.
The nature of culture-based creativity is closely linked to the nature of artistic contribution as expressed in art or cultural productions.
The spontaneous, intuitive, singular and human nature of cultural creation enriches society2.
Culture-based creativity can intervene in companies through the sale of a variety of creative services (from the provision of creative goods such as a website or a video to consulting services) or the integration of creative staff in organisations at production, distribution as well as management levels.
A company indeed needs more than an efficient manufacturing process, cost-control and a good technological base to remain competitive.
It also requires a strong brand, motivated staff and a management that respects creativity and understands its process. It also needs the development of products and services that meet citizens’ expectations, or that create these expectations.
• Being at the crossroads between arts, business and technology, CCIs are in a strategic position to trigger spill-overs in other industries and stimulate cross innovation through the combination of multidisciplinary forms of creativity.

2.2. HOW CREATIVE SKILLS CONTRIBUTE TO INNOVATION
CCIs’ innovation potential is closely linked to the ability of artists and creative professionals to question routines and challenge the systematic, relying on the unpredictable or unwanted surprises born from the meeting of diverse skills and competencies.
What are the creative skills capable of supporting innovation?
Artists and Creative Professionals have:
• A critical and disruptive vision of a situation, space and time;
• The capacity to question “progress”;
• A capacity to give non-functional meanings;
• The ability to generate emotion;
• A capacity to transform society as drivers and leaders of changes (political, social, economic or technological);
• A “sharing attitude”: artists are first movers in the sharing economy;
• The capacity to create a fan base community (networking);
• An aptitude to work with people from different backgrounds and cultures;
• Ability to work in teams (at least in some sectors) and in a flexible and collaborative way;
• An aptitude to think laterally and express abstraction and symbolism: creative people are often brokers across
disciplines, where skills and attitudes are conducive to creativity.
Cultural Institutions and Operators are able to:
• Attract and gather people and enable socialisation;
• Reinvent/rehabilitate (unused) places;
• Entertain and “stage” experiences, whether individual or collective;
• Transmit culture and knowledge;
• Promote common history and cultural values;
• Challenge and Educate.
Culture and Creative Industries have the ability to:
• Entrust artists and creative professionals;
• Manage risk and understand failure;
• Create trends as critical brokers between creativity and the market;
• Generate experience and emotions whether individual or collective;
• Promote user-led and sustai
nable values and working practices.

2.3. THE “CREATIVE SPILL-OVER” CONCEPT

Creative spill-overs are about putting the innovation potential of CCIs at the service of other industries or services.
Creative spill-overs might be defined as benefits arising from the activities of CCIs, including artists and creative professionals, which determine positive effects on other sectors of the economy or society.
Those positive externalities result from processes through which culture-based creativity spreads out from the CCIs, across economic sectors and industries, thus contributing to innovation in the wider economy.
Creative spill-overs can result from unplanned interactions between economic agents but they can also be approached in a more strategic way with a view to tapping into the potential of culture-based creativity for socio-economic development.
The benefits of interacting with CCIs’ skills are well-known:
• Product and service by combining new ideas, designs or expressive components such as symbols or
aesthetics enabling companies to engage with customers’ sensibilities and create a unique relationship (e.g. cultural contents such as music or videos contribute to provide entertainment but also emotional experiences
in relation to various (ICT) products and services).
• Human resources by enabling creativity to flourish in companies’ and public organisations’ HR management
strategies, to shape better products and services (e.g. through design management, artistic interventions3 in companies or the public administration, or valorisation of creative functions).
• Organisational processes by contributing to creative production or delivery methods that directly involve
and/or better take into account consumers’ needs in a “user-led” fashion (e.g. through the introduction of
design-thinking techniques4), that rely on collaborative and decentralised work and entrust creative
professionals (e.g. CEOs coming from the creative field onto the executive board of technological companies),
or that are based on the combination of multi-disciplinary competences (e.g. artists mingling with scientists
open new R&D avenues5).
• Branding by adding a creative or artistic dimension as part of a brand’s distinctive identity (e.g. large
fashion brands are linking up with artists, designers, crafts and art to give higher end (luxury) status to handbags, perfumes and catwalks; museums’ collections, art exhibitions or performances are sponsored by private companies as part of branding or Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) strategies).
Arts and culture can also contribute to brand territories and develop new urban areas, including distinct
’creative quarters’ in cities.
• Communication for instance to illustrate companies’ results and communication in a clearer or more
appealing way either to investors or end-users.

2.4. CITIES: THE BEST PLACE TO FUEL A CREATIVE ECONOMY

We live in an era of great socioeconomic transformation. Many European cities are confronted with industrial delocalisation, the shift towards a knowledge-based economy and rising levels of unemployment. Globalisation, the economic and financial crisis and post-industrial constraints, are drawing cities into intense competition to attract and retain talent and develop new and innovative economic activities. Cities are setting up departments to recruit foreign investors, they pamper local companies with a variety of incentives, set up hubs, clusters and industrial parks to encourage entrepreneurship and better connect the research and business worlds, and they invest in broadband connections and transport infrastructures to remain connected.
Indeed, in the knowledge economy, innovation is not associated with isolated industry, incubators, business parks or research labs. It is rather promoted through a network of connectivity, collaboration, knowledge exchange, learning and spill-over benefits nurtured by the development of new connections across sectors and disciplines, and the adoption of new innovation processes (cross-sectoral innovation, open innovation, user-led innovation, design-thinking, etc.).
Cities (including both big metropolis and smaller towns) can count on an extraordinary pool of resources (cultural, technological, educational, etc.) which can be mobilised with a view to promoting economic growth and competitive advantage in this networked economy. Rather than companies taking centre stage, urban environments with lively neighborhoods are thus increasingly at the heart of innovation strategies.
Cities have the most appropriate size to act as R&D centres, by connecting intellectual, technological and cultural resources and enabling knowledge flows and unexpected encounters. As argued in numerous studies6, a limited geographical area allows information to flow more easily thanks to lower transport costs, larger pools of skilled workers as well as facility of social interactions and networking opportunities. However, the capacity of companies to “absorb” new inputs, depends not only on individual firms, but also on external factors such as the characteristics of the local productive structure, the presence of a creative environment and the institutional framework. Local authorities are therefore in a crucial position to deploy the right resources, tools and measures and enable local ecosystems to foster creative spill-overs for innovation.
Cultural resources have a key role to play in triggering economic and social innovation. Yet, they are often overlooked. The soul of a city, its unique cultural identity, and its capacity to be festive and make noise, are crucial factors of distinctiveness in the competition to attract industries and talents. In turn, the skills offered by artists, cultural organisations, and creative professionals help businesses to differentiate themselves whether in product innovation, branding, or communication. Creative people and artists are key, because they develop the ideas, metaphors and messages which help to drive social networking and attractive collective experiences.

3. THE CREATIVE SpIN PROJECT
3.1. OBJECTIVES & RATIONALE

Creative SpIN was a URBACT Thematic Network (2012-2015) which aimed at defining and testing tools and methods to connect culture and creative Industries (CCIs) with other sectors of the economy, in order to stimulate “creative spill-overs” and contribute to innovation.
Cities are increasingly aware of the potential of CCIs for creativity, innovation and growth.
Still, various challenges remain to be addressed to connect CCIs with other sectors, including the lack of common vocabulary between different sectors (both at industrial and policy level), preconceptions of the CCIs’ nature and functioning mechanisms, and the reticence of CCIs themselves to engage with other businesses and commercial interests.
Cities are the best placed to trigger “Creative SpINs”: they know very well their local cultural assets and creative companies, which are very often micro-enterprise.
They are in a unique position to set the ecology
fostering interactions as their size facilitates
exchange and learning.
They can act as a test-bed to experiment new forms of sustainable economic development enhancing creative spill-overs.
Creative SpIN’s rationale lies in the need to
identify the best tools and methods that can help cities make the most of their cultural and policy
resources, break the (still existing) silos and foster an ecosystem leading to creative spill-overs.

3. KEY LEARNING POINTS
A number of key learnings (further explained in the following pages) can be acknowledged:
A) Cities have a wealth of cultural resources
B) Culture can help local authorities reach various policy objectives
C) Creative spill-over is possible for both small and large cities
D) But several bottlenecks and challenges remain to be addressed
E) A creative spill-over ecosystem is needed
F) Local authorities have a key role to play
G) Policy tools to promote “creative spill-over” are numerous and can take different forms
H) The ability to connect People is key to foster creative spill-over Processes and Projects: the role of “creative
mediators”
I) Creative spill-over does not require large public investment: it is rather about reallocating of existing
resources to break barriers to cross-over
J) It is important to value experimentation and track it down to share experiences
A) CITIES HAVE A WEALTH OF CULTURAL RESOURCES
As confirmed by the preliminary analysis of the partner cities and subsequent site visits, Creative SpIN’s cities can count on a wealth of cultural resources that can be mobilised for creative spill-over objectives.
These can be classified as follows:
• Territorial Culture - including identity, languages, natural landscapes, geography, food, social behaviors,
folkloristic traditions, local literature, intercultural society, etc.
• Historical and Cultural Heritage sites;
• Cultural Icons (in the field of art, literature, poetry, music, etc.);
• Cultural Institutions & Operators – from museums to performing art organisations;
• Culture and creative industries - from individual companies to creative clusters;
• Artistic Interventions in public and private organisations or urban settings (in the form of exhibitions,
festivals, parties, performances, art works, etc.);
• Educational - including all kinds of education, training and research institutes which contribute to human
capital development by raising artistic, cultural and creative skills and competencies, as well as helping to
shape multidisciplinary minds able to work across sectors and disciplines.
If adequately exploited, cultural resources are an essential source of “authentic” differentiation, in different ways: on the one hand, Cultural Icons, Heritage and Territorial Culture provide cities with a distinctive identity and image that help strengthen their “unique” attractiveness potential. Think of Mons and the popular festival “Doudou” which has become a cultural icon for the city and a very strong symbol of identity in which all the inhabitants recognise themselves. Since 2005, the Doudou has been classified as UNESCO World Heritage. That competition to get these kinds of title is more and more increasing is a clear sign of how culture becomes a key distinctiveness and attractiveness feature for cities.
On the other, Artistic Interventions, Cultural Institutions and Operators, and Culture and Creative
Industries owe a number of different creative skills that are likely to generate unconventional and original ideas and contribute to innovation in any economic sector.


B) CULTURE CAN HELP LOCAL AUTHORITIES REACH VARIOUS POLICY OBJECTIVES
Creative cities are those who are able to integrate culture and the creative industries in their development plan. As a result, cultural policy is no longer only about funding art institutions alone or preserving cultural heritage to attract tourists.
Such innovation and large-encompassing vision of cultural policy is well reflected in Creative SpIN’s LAPs. The Local Action Plans clearly show the range of objectives that are being pursued through culture and creative spill-overs, as illustrated in the table below:
POLICY OBJECTIVES
Economic innovation & entrepreneurship:
• With focus on tourism and ICT
• With focus on manufacturing
• Social innovation
- With focus on health and wellbeing
• Urban regeneration/planning

C) CREATIVE SPILL-OVER IS FOR BOTH SMALL AND LARGE CITIES
To be a creative city is not a fixed trait. Creativity can be nurtured in all cities, from large to small ones. At the foundation of a creative city, lies the belief that cultural and social capital can be better used to express the creative potential of a city.
Cities like Mons (see in particular Box 9), Kortrijk, Bologna, Tallinn or Košice show that creative spill-over ecosystems can grow in smaller urban areas, due to the presence of truly shared local culture, identity, “language” and traditions and closer relations.
Indeed, although medium and small-sized cities may not have the same visibility and developed infrastructures as big metropolises, they have specific advantages. The creative and knowledge-based sector indeed requires informal alliances and networking involving public and private stakeholders, something that is easier to handle in simpler governance systems that are found in smaller cities. Compared to big cities, smaller ones often also feature less pollution, proximity to nature, affordable spaces for business and living, less environmental degradation and close-knit community25. Medium-sized cities are also easier to network and provide better quality of life. Features such as community engagement, a culture of collaboration and participation, and social proximity can be considered as important strengths of smaller areas.

D) BUT SEVERAL BOTTLENECKS AND CHALLENGES REMAIN TO BE ADDRESSED
Cities are places with abundant creative resources ready to be mined to generate creative spill-overs. Still, several challenges remain to be addressed to connect culture with the rest of the economy and society:
• Need to build capacity in CCIs: the sector is fragmented and lacks a clear interlocutor vis-à-vis policy makers
and the business world;
• Limited understanding of artistic and creative skills and their value beyond cultural productions and
entertainment;
• Scepticism in the cultural sector as well as the business sector due to the existence of different mindsets and
vocabularies;
• “Siloed” visions and working methods (in education, administration, policy, business, etc.);
• Lack of evaluation tools showing impacts.
E) A creative spill-over ecosystem is needed
Whilst cities have plenty of resources featuring a creative spill-over potential (from cultural professionals, companies and skills to business in search of innovative ideas to physical infrastructures where to encourage cross-sectoral interactions), their innovation strategies often need to better apprehend and promote the value of non-technological innovation. This represents a missed opportunity, when cities strive to improve the quality of life and opportunities for all.
A creative spill-over ecosystem, as a system of interconnecting and interacting parts, would enable cultural resources to cooperate with local private and public stakeholders acting in any field with a view to unlock the innovative potential of culture.
Developing a creative spill-over ecosystem is thus a promising, yet ambitious task. It requires:
• the identification of cultural and creative resources and their spill-over potential;
• the adoption of a new vision of innovation that goes beyond technological innovation, thus requiring an
important cultural change and mind shift;
• the integration of creative spill-overs in local innovation strategies;
• the development of ad hoc policy tools to raise awareness and connect operators who are not used to sharing
a dialogue and working together.

F) LOCAL AUTHORITIES HAVE A KEY ROLE TO PLAY
A global creative economy does not indeed mean that we transcend the limits of time and space. Quite to the contrary, the spatial dimension and the interactions generated on a limited territory are crucial for creativity to emerge.
Local authorities are therefore in a crucial position to establish creative ecosystems as an integral part of innovation strategies. They play a decisive role in sustaining the local cultural environment through direct public investments in culture, without which many cultural institutions and organisations would not be in a position to create. At the same time, mainstreaming CCIs across diverse policy areas (e.g. economic development and innovation policies) creates the preconditions for a more holistic ecosystem.
Cities know the cultural and creative players established in their area. To support creative spill-overs, local authorities need to mobilise these players and assess their readiness to economic growth, social development and innovation.
At the same time, local authorities are in a privileged position to mobilise companies and entrepreneurs in traditional fields of the economy. They can mediate new relationships and initiate new connections between different competences, fields and sectors. They can show how to apply transversal thinking in decision making.
The local social fabric and the infrastructure provide the basis for testing new ideas and developing new interactions leading to the invention of new forms of urban planning, new services and jobs as well as the empowerment of citizens.
In Creative SpIN cities, local authorities are playing a key role in setting up the right atmosphere conducive to creative interactions, in encouraging unlikely encounters and in teaming up local creative, technical, business or administrative resources. Various policy actions are being tested in this sense (or are going to be as part of the LAPs) going from the support to big cultural events as an occasion to foster creativity and innovation (Mons), to the creation of physical or management (infra)structures to foster new interactions (Bologna, Kortrijk, Rotterdam), to the support to urban/social regeneration projects (Essen, Birmingham) to skills development (Bologna, Košice, Kortrijk).
G) POLICY TOOLS TO PROMOTE “CREATIVE SPILL-OVER” ARE NUMEROUS AND CAN TAKE DIFFERENT FORMS
There is no recipe to successfully generate creative spill-overs. However, there are a series of tools, including policy tools, which can contribute to their emergence.
Site visit to the cities, exchange of practices and analysis of the LAPs have shown that such tools can take different forms: support creative mediators, awareness raising events/campaigns, support to collaborative ventures (through public funding), innovation vouchers, etc.
Combination of tools, rather than single and “on the spot” solutions, is likely to lead to the development of creative and sustainable ecosystems that acknowledge and make the most of the innovative potential of culture.
H) THE ABILITY TO CONNECT PEOPLE IS KEY TO FOSTER CREATIVE SPILL-OVER PROCESSES AND PROJECTS: THE ROLE OF “CREATIVE MEDIATORS”
One of the main findings of the project is about the key role played by “versatile” people to connect different skills, visions and practices.
“Creative mediators” are intermediaries, brokers between creative people and professionals from other disciplines, not necessarily related to CCIs. They are people able to work across disciplines with an open mind, people that bring their knowledge of a sector (often culture) into another area.
Creative mediators can be civil servants, social workers, entrepreneurs, associations, large or small companies, universities, artists, designers or politicians. From an employment perspective, they may be project managers, assisting the transformation of urban areas, the emergence of multidisciplinary spaces or the development of new business activities and services, or of innovation capacity. Importantly, Disruptive Connectors can also be found in cities’ administration.
Their function is to trigger new Processes and Projects that facilitate fruitful interactions between disciplines, departments or people thus enabling economic and social innovation. Disruptive Connectors play a key role in the process as they instill new ideas in organisations and provoke a disruptive influence on traditional and routine thinking.
I) CREATIVE SPILL-OVER DOES NOT REQUIRE LARGE PUBLIC INVESTMENT – IT IS RATHER ABOUT REALLOCATING OF EXISTING RESOURCES TO BREAK BARRIERS TO CROSS-OVER
The appointment of creative mediators, the setting up of awareness raising events/campaigns or calls for projects are not particularly costly. Physical spaces for interactions and funding for innovative projects are often available, too.
A creative spill-over strategy requires the adoption of new visions and priorities and the adaptation of current policy tools, rather than big public investments.

J) IT IS IMPORTANT TO VALUE EXPERIMENTATION AND TRACK IT DOWN TO SHARE EXPERIENCES
Cities are increasingly aware of the “transformative power” of culture. Yet, creative spill-over remains a very much new policy field. Cities are experimenting tools and actions to foster new forms of cooperation and projects hopefully leading to the development of creative spill-overs.
As creative spill-over is about challenging the existing to get something new and innovative, beyond traditional schemes, traditions and beliefs, valuing and promoting experimentation is a key condition enabling the development of creative spill-overs.
Experimentations can either target a specific sector, or address multiple sectors at the same time. The sectoral approach has been adopted and maintained by the majority of cities in Creative SpIN (Birmingham: health and wellbeing; Bologna and Kortrijk: manufacturing; Bologna and Birmingham: education; Mons and Košice: tourism and ICT; Essen and Tallinn: urban planning). Only Rotterdam opted for a transversal approach. The objective is to give people the freedom to experiment in any sector where a call for creativity and innovation could emerge.
As creative spill-over is a very much new and exploratory policy field, and as suggested by many project Partners, it is important to monitor creative spill-over actions and tools and keep track of results in order to share experience and learn from the implementation of LAPs.

5.CONCLUSIONS AND POLICY
RECOMMENDATIONS
Europe’s multiculturalism is a chance to stimulate creativity. Europe’s diverse cultures, its history and geography are a significant source of creativity. It is Europe’s diversity and its patchwork heritage that has shaped its destiny and will determine its future. Pluralism, openness and cosmopolitanism, typical of the European model, are an extraordinary resource of creativity.
The challenge for Europe is to make the best of its cultural diversity to deal with the great economic transformation of our time in the context of globalisation.
To a large extent, Europe’s future is dependent on its ability to transcend local identities to harness creativity but also to ensure the presence of diverse local identities in an international context. By asserting and developing its creative ambitions, Europe can become a very significant force for the generation of innovative ideas and services which have both significant economic value and the capacity to improve the quality of life of its citizens.
A spill-over policy would be about making the most of Europe’s cultural and creative diversity to help EU remain competitive but also build an economy that is sustainable and social friendly. To this end, policy makers at all levels should make sure that available instruments take all forms of innovation and support into account to reinforce cross-sectoral fertilisation.
The European Union has extensively recognised the innovative potential of CCIs (Communication on “Innovation Union” (2010), “Promoting cultural and creative sectors to for growth and jobs in the EU” (2012), “Industrial Renaissance” (2014), etc.) and invited in particular local authorities to invest in this industry as it “can help to boost local economies, stimulate new activities, create new and sustainable jobs, have important spill-over effects on other industries and enhance the attractiveness of regions and cities” (Regional Policy contributing to smart growth in Europe 2020).
1) Raise awareness about the innovative potential of culture by:
1.1. Identifying (local) cultural resources (from territorial culture to cultural operators to creative industries, ..) and acknowledging their creative spill-over potential;
1.2. Making use of tools such as mappings, impact assessments, events, conferences workshops, good practices or communication campaigns to raise awareness about the innovative potential of culture.
2) Integrate creative spill-overs in local innovation strategies by:
2.1. Embracing and promoting a broad vision of innovation (both technological and non-technological);
2.2. Integrating cultural resources in local innovation policies and strategies to make cultural investment more sustainable, build interconnections and raise creative skills that can benefit the local economy and society, at large;
2.3. Associating culture departments in the work of all other relevant departments (economic development, innovation, tourism, urban planning, health/public services, etc.);
2.4. Making the most of big cultural events as an opportunity to reshape local development/innovation strategies and foster new relations between local actors and talents who are not used to work together (culture, ICT, tourism, etc…);
2.5. Incorporating creative bottom-up initiatives in top-down strategies with a view to include innovative perspectives and insights in local policies, empower citizens and make them feel part of a “common project” and co-produced solutions;
3) Enable and assess creative spill-overs by:
3.1. Supporting creative training and processes (e.g. design-thinking) to raise creative capacities;
Cities are indeed the best setting to experiment new processes and tools for creative spill-overs. Cities (particularly, European cities) can call on a wealth of cultural and creative resources ready to be mobilised for innovation purposes. They feature an adequate size to favour encounters and knowledge exchange, facilitated by the existence of shared “codes”, languages and cultures in territorial communities. They have a number of tools (funds, public procurement, physical infrastructures, etc.) that can be used for creative spill-over objectives.
Creative SpIN took creative spill-over policies a step further as it enabled cities to pass from a spill-over “vision” to concrete “actions”. However, creative spill-over policy remains in an “embryonic” phase and more awareness and evidence is needed to fully unlock CCIs’ innovative potential. A follow-up to the Creative SpIN project would thus be very much helpful to monitor creative spill-over actions, track impacts and share learning across Europe. Programmes such as URBACT but also INTERREG, Creative Europe, Horizon 2020, COSME, Structural Funds or Erasmus + should be mobilised both by cities and the European institutions in this sense.
The Creative SpIN project suggests the possible direction of future projects and policy actions to stimulate creative spill-overs. Based on the project’s experience, a number of policy recommendations are proposed below. These are mainly directed at cities but can certainly be a source of inspiration also for policy makers acting at regional, national and European level.
3.2. Finding people in the city, with a motivation and ability to act as “creative mediators” between different sectors, codes, vocabularies and culture;
3.3. Using all available tools (from public funding to tendering processes to physical infrastructures) to provide incentives to interdisciplinary collaborations (e.g. through calls for projects or associating culture and creative industries);
3.4. Establishing dedicated management structure to stimulate cross-sectoral encounters;
3.5. Setting up or joining European projects to share and learn from good practices in Europe, under different programmes URBACT, INTERREG, Creative Europe, Horizon 2020, COSME, Structural Funds, Erasmus +);
3.6. Developing appropriate tools and methodologies to monitor progress and assess creative spill-over’s tools and impacts on innovation.";"17.txt";"17"
"CSI Europe: City Sustainable Investment.
Introduction.
At the end of August 2012, around €1.8bn had been committed to the JESSICA initiative across the European Union. This covers 55 European regions and the establishment of 41 Urban Development Funds. Alongside the implementation of existing funds, efforts are still underway to create new funds within the current 2007-2013 Structural Funds Programming Period, while increasingly attention is being drawn to preparations for the next Programming Period 2014-2020. The rapid development of the initiative at the same time as the deterioration of the economic environment across Europe has brought a number of challenges and opportunities. It is nevertheless clear that there is considerable existing and growing appetite for this type of initiative. This enthusiasm is supported by the draft regulations for the next Programming Period, which include an enhanced role for financial instruments, together with the growing need for cities to establish alternative, more sustainable mechanisms for public financing of urban development projects, especially given the ever-challenging banking environment and current financial crisis. We believe there is a strong rationale for the proposed CSI Europe URBACT Thematic Network. CSI Europe will, through a programme of learning and exchange with partner cities with different JESSICA implementation experiences, aim to capture the lessons learnt and best practice developed so far in the implementation of the initiative. CSI Europe will focus on the extent to which the JESSICA mechanism can be more efficiently embedded and ‘mainstreamed’ within development policy and delivery at city level and build upon the initial ERDF investment by attracting further public and private investment. The Network will also strive to use the experience and evidence it assembles to influence the design and development of future urban-based financial instruments, especially those under development for the 2014-2020 Programming Period. 
Background to JESSICA 
Joint European Support for Sustainable Investment in City Areas (JESSICA) is an initiative developed by the European Commission in partnership with the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the Council of Europe Development Bank (CEB). The initiative aims to support the sustainable urban development of cities through the creation of revolving investment funds. JESSICA responds to the need to support sustainable urban development by addressing a shortage of investment available to support regeneration projects. JESSICA was launched with a view to providing new funding opportunities for Managing Authorities and Cities in the current (2007- 2013) programming period by: • ensuring long-term sustainable support to urban development through the revolving nature of the public investment in the Holding Fund and/or Urban Development Fund • contributing financial and managerial expertise from specialist institutions such as the EIB, the CEB and other financial institutions • leveraging additional resources for PPPs and other urban projects in the regions of the EU • creating a better balance between risk and reward, enabling the public sector to achieve its policy objectives but potentially participate in the selected intervention at no net cost. JESSICA can also act as a powerful catalyst for the establishment of the partnerships between Member States, regions, cities, the European Investment Bank, the Central European Bank, other banks, investors and fund managers. The initiative has been designed in the context of EU Cohesion Policy for 2007-2013, as governed by the Structural Funds Regulations (including the General Regulation, the ERDF Regulation, the ESF Regulation, and the Implementing Regulation, collectively referred to as the SF Regulations)1. Preparations are already underway for the next Programming Period and as indicated in the draft regulations for that period it is anticipated that significant amounts of future cohesion funding are expected to be invested using financial instruments. Both a proposed ring-fencing minimum of 5% of ERDF contributions for urban development and with much greater focus on energy efficiency/renewable energy activity in particular, ‘JESSICA-type’ financial instruments will cease to be special projects within the programme and will instead be part of the mainstream funding package for the 2014-2020 Programming Period. Through the Network, we will strive to demonstrate that there is potential for the initiative to become much more than an ERDF funding mechanism, seeking to identify/ demonstrate models for UDF governance and ways in which they can invest. In some cases, it is already evident that the initial ERDF and match funding contribution to the UDF is really viewed as seed/catalytic financing, which represents a basis upon which a structure can be created, a track record developed, investment strategies broadened, and further public and private investment ultimately leveraged. Through this evolution, the hope is that the UDF can become a much more intrinsic element of a city’s urban policy and delivery architecture, thereby delivering greater impact on the ground. However, with a greater role sometimes goes a need for greater alignment with the city’s governance; in these cases, it may then cause further complications in respect of public balance sheet implications and the treatment of public sector debt. On the other hand, if a fund is to attract private sector investment in the future, the governance arrangements must be acceptable to private investors. In terms of the resources the UDF is able to invest, a range of match funding sources and investment approaches are currently in operation. The match funding combinations include private sector co-financed UDFs, public sector cofinanced UDFs, as well as hybrids of the two. The Network will look at assessing the relative merits of these respective combinations. In respect of the manner in which the UDFs are able to invest, a significant breakthrough in the state aid framework for JESSICA was achieved in mid-2011, when the first JESSICA state aid approvals were obtained in the North West of England and Andalucia regions. These decisions now allow for subcommercial public investment being made alongside investors investing under the market economy principle. This not only potentially enables UDFs to support a broader range of projects, but also significantly improves their attractiveness for private sector investment, both at fund and project levels. The Network will consider the extent to which these state aid decisions could be replicated in each of the partner cities and assess the potential for it to ultimately form an EU-wide framework. 
SYNTHESIS 
Cities within the CSI Europe partnership have a range of different experiences in implementing JESSICA, but a number of common issues have emerged from the Baseline Study work and partner visits. These issues have been grouped into five key themes identified for further exploration and analysis through the Implementation Phase. The findings and recommendations of each of the themes are considered relevant for the Local Support Groups, the Network as a whole, and wider stakeholders such as the European Commission. To maximise the exchange of learning, best practice and ideas across the partnership, each partner has been allocated to one of the first four themes and paired with another city or cities (depending on the breadth of the theme). Themes have been allocated based upon each city’s interest, knowledge and understanding. The final theme will be addressed by the partnership as a whole, but managed by Manchester as Lead Partner, and it is intended that this work will follow the first four themes. Partner cities will test and reflect the findings of each theme at a local level through their Local Support Groups. 
WORKPLAN  
The work plan of implementation phase will be broadly divided into three phases: research, analysis and dissemination. Phase 1 - Research (February 2013 - April 2013) Theme leads will initially build upon the information provided in the baseline study to further research their respective theme. This will ensure that each partner city and their supporting LSG have the opportunity to develop their own learning base in the chosen topic, recognising of course that five of the partners are relatively new to the project and may not have direct experience of the topic in question. This period will also allow partners the opportunity to reacquaint themselves with the project and energise the LSGs, given the three-month time lag between the submission of the final application and the decision of the URBACT PMC. During this period the partners will, through their LSG, each develop their Local Action Plan, which should identify the local priorities for action, in addition to embedding the key themes in the LSG’s work. Theme Leads will be expected to hold at least monthly video conferences or equivalents to discuss progress and findings and hold quarterly LSGs. During this period, theme leads will also develop their work plan for the analysis phase. At the end of April 2013, the partnership will hold the first meeting of the Implementation Phase. At this meeting, each partner will present details of their Local Action Plan and theme leads will present the outputs from their research and their proposed work plan for the key theme for the next phase. Phase 2 - Analysis (May 2013 - June 2014) The second phase of the theme work programme will commence immediately following the first meeting. The second phase will be the longest of the three phases and will run until June 2014. The focus of this phase will be on the development of proposals/model approaches to address the issues raised in each subtheme as well as implementing the Local Action Plans. During this period, partners will be expected to continue to hold quarterly LSGs to analyse the issues and develop and test proposals. Theme leads will be expected to hold regular bilateral videoconferences or equivalent to share learning experiences and constructively challenge each other’s inputs into the proposals. The partnership as a whole will come together four times during this phase, with each meeting focusing on one theme and the implications of the findings and proposals on the final theme – standardised fund models. By allowing the partnership to collectively focus on one theme in this way, the partnership as a whole will have the opportunity to develop a much greater understanding of the specific detail of each theme. It will also allow the theme leads to benefit from peer review of the findings and recommendations to help further refine their thinking. Phase 3 – Dissemination (July 2014 – March 2015) The final phase of the work programme will focus on building on the findings of each theme to develop standardised fund models for the future 2014–2020 Programming Period and then disseminating and publicising the findings, conclusions and recommendations of the project. A specific transnational seminar will be held three months after the start of this phase. This seminar will focus on pulling together the recommendations from each of the previous four thematic seminars and presenting possible standardised fund models for replication in cities. Following this seminar, partners will then organise a local conference to present the conclusions of the project and the recommendations of their Local Action Plans. Local Action Plans will be expected as a minimum to propose how the standardised fund models could be embedded within the relevant city structure. A final partnership plus external attendees conference will be held towards the end of the remaining period March 2015. Further dissemination events will be planned as appropriate and the final reports will be prepared and launched. The themes and subthemes are explained in the following sections. 
THEME - UD F/CITY ALIGNMENT 
This theme will explore the extent to which the investment strategy of financial instruments such as Urban Development Funds (UDF) can be aligned with the urban development strategies and community-led development strategies of the cities in the area. The partner cities in the Network all have clear strategies for regeneration that reflect the particular conditions in their area and the city’s priorities for action. The strategies, which have been developed through the city’s democratic structures, often in consultation with local businesses and residents, provide a framework that will guide action and investment by the city in the future. These strategies are often further supplemented by community-led development strategies prepared by local action groups. As financial instruments become embedded in future ERDF and other funding mechanisms, it is essential that the UDFs active in a city’s area have investment strategies aligned with the city’s and the relevant local action group’s priorities. The Network will explore how cities can ensure alignment between UDF and city strategies through UDF governance mechanisms that ensure cities have the ability to influence and guide the funds’ activities. This would include city involvement in the development of a fund’s overall investment strategy, development of project pipeline, identification of complementary financing, and utilisation of the fund’s resources in conjunction with other public funds, including a grant where necessary. The experience of partner cities to date has been mixed. The baseline study identifies how, to date, much of the activity has been directed towards the establishment of UDFs rather than the investment into projects. Furthermore, in the current economic climate demand for the funding is relatively low. As a result, funds are investing in an opportunistic way, supporting projects that are sufficiently advanced and capable of supporting the investment. This has meant that there has sometimes been limited dialogue between cities and funds and this has contributed towards a lack of awareness and understanding between the parties of their respective requirements. The Network will seek to consider how this can be addressed, recognising that if financial instruments are to become part of mainstream public funding for urban development, it is essential that the governance arrangements reflect the public interest, as identified in the city strategies, as well as the traditional risk and return considerations of investment funds. The work of the Network will look at how to ensure cities can add value to the governance of UDFs in areas including: • Future Integrated Plans for Sustainable Urban Development - initiatives such as Smart Cities and Smart Specialisation Strategies for Regional Investment, place cities at the centre of innovation, providing strategic leadership to guide future investment of public funds. • Identification of priority projects - as demand increases it will be vital that financial instruments utilise their funds to support those priority projects that will have the greatest impact on urban development. • Securing policy priorities - using the UDFs to secure wider policy priorities, including high-quality urban development, public realm and other social benefits. • Use of subcommercial investments - as state-aid compliant frameworks are developed to enable UDFs to make subcommercial investments, cities can provide leadership to guide how and when such support can be deployed by funds. The partner visits have identified a range of different governance structures for funds established, or being established in the partner cities. These range from national or regional funds under the management of public and private sector banks and other financial institutions to a fund wholly controlled by a single city. The range of different governance arrangements active within the Network will allow experience to be shared through the implementation phase, with the transnational learning being cascaded down through the LSGs. 
THEME – TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE 
The majority of public sector intervention in urban development has historically been funded by grant support from a mixture of European and national funding sources. As a result, cities and their public sector partners have developed strong expertise in grant regimes, grant appraisal and information requirements, the relevant regulations, monitoring requirements and state-aid considerations. However, reducing public sector budgets has limited the availability of grant resource increasing the need to use more financially sustainable forms of public intervention, including through the use of financial instruments in the future. While the management and appraisal of grant resource provides an excellent grounding for the development and management of financial instruments, financial instruments are more complex, have different regulations and demand different skills and expertise. Aside from the structural and regulatory differences, financial instruments require public servants to be able to take a dual approach and to be able to develop and assess projects that not only deliver regeneration objectives and benefits but that are also capable of generating a financial return. During the partner visits, a number of partner cities have expressed a need to increase their knowledge and understanding of financial instruments. This is to achieve the following aims: • To increase knowledge and understanding of fund managers’ project requirements – so as to enable cities to play a greater role in developing suitable investment propositions for fund managers. If public servants better understand the information requirements and types of projects fund managers are seeking, this will enable public servants to better ‘feed’ UDF pipelines, increasing the UDF pipeline and also improving the alignment between the UDF and the city’s own investment strategies and fund impact. • To enable public servants to better understand the opportunities and risks of participating in JESSICA-type financial instruments, hopefully increasing the take-up of financial instruments by cities. In some instances public servants have insufficient information and understanding to be able to assess how a city should best engage in the development of financial instruments. JESSICA-type instruments are quite complex and novel and the lack of completed case studies and sometimes vague regulations can lead to a perception that the instruments are unproven and risky. This can result in cities taking a more passive role in the financial instrument and arguably not always optimising the potential opportunities presented by the funds. The availability of grants has also proved essential in enabling cities to develop capital regeneration programmes, to test the feasibility of concepts, prepare masterplans and planning applications, prepare remediation strategies, designs, costs, undertake market assessments and ultimately develop investable propositions. Therefore limited grant budgets also often equate to a lack of public resources available to fund the predevelopment costs of public and private sponsored projects. This type of expenditure is necessary to work up project ideas into a sufficiently mature state so they would withstand the information requirements and due diligence appraisals of fund managers. Without budget support for the activity, public sector priority projects are overlooked in favour of more advanced and investment-ready proposals. As predevelopment expenditure is effectively risk capital, private developers also are often unwilling to commit expenditure to work up projects where there is uncertainty around the likely funding structure and sources for the ensuing main project. Without mature project proposals to review and provide assurance around deliverability and viability, funders are unable to provide the comfort developers seek prior to investing funds to further develop projects. This results in progress stalling, or at best progress being slowed down, with projects being developed iteratively to minimise the developer’s exposure. Fund managers operating in some partner cities have cited that there is no shortage of project ideas for their consideration, but there is often a lack of defined and mature projects that are investment-ready. It would also appear that this is even more of a prevalent issue in smaller cities, where resources can be even more constrained. To conclude, this theme will consider ways in which public servants’ knowledge and understanding of JESSICA-type financial instruments could be expanded to address the issues identified and support the more effective engagement of cities in Urban Development Funds. It will also consider the feasibility of developing a technical assistance fund to support city and UDF project pipeline development, so as to accelerate delivery progress and impact in preparation for the next Programming Period. 
THEME - STATE AID AND PRIVATE INVESTMENT 
Both Manchester and Seville benefit from the first JESSICA state aid decisions so far secured from the European Commission1. The decisions follow a very similar format and the notifications were prepared with input and support from the European Investment Bank. It is understood that these decisions are subsequently being reviewed by other Member States to ascertain whether a similar approach to state aid and JESSICA would be beneficial to them. Further similar notifications are expected to follow shortly during the latter part of 2012. The state aid decisions provide significant advantages to the JESSICA mechanism, which are listed as follows: • By permitting the provision of debt and equity on subcommercial terms when certain conditions are met, the state aid decisions enable UDF investment to be used to help overcome viability issues, broadening the scope of projects that could be potentially considered by UDF managers for investment. • UDFs are consequently able to address a wider range of market failures. The impact and regenerative benefit of UDFs is as a result potentially greater. In this respect a trade-off between socioeconomic and financial returns is possible. • The more flexible deployment of the UDF investment in the manner permitted by the decisions should engender greater confidence from developers and other investors, encouraging a potentially greater and earlier level of development than may have been the case. The possibility of fund level private sector investment is also increased. • The ability to include grant funding and/or align the UDFs to existing sources of grant funding is significant. The ability of UDFs to combine both grant and repayable investments in projects ought, subject to the right incentives, result in more efficient use of public sector resources. It is understood that although each notification is following a very similar format to the UK and Spanish decisions, to date an EU-wide JESSICA state aid exemption based upon similar conditions to the existing decisions has not been progressed. From the partner visits, state aid is clearly an issue and partners would appear in some circumstances to require greater clarity and flexibility. Given the potential advantages provided by the existing state aid decisions, there is merit in exploring the feasibility of such an EU-wide exemption as a theme of the Network. This theme will therefore consider in more detail the need and justification for such an EU-wide exemption. The state aid decisions are also significant in that they enable UDFs to offer preferential funding terms to potential investors at fund level. A number of partner cities have raised the need to attract a greater level of private investment to support their regeneration plans and programmes. Urban regeneration by its very nature can be typically viewed by potential investors as being high risk, with low return levels, often with long-term payback periods. The level of uncertainty around risk and return often dissuades investors or leads to investors overpricing risk into their investment terms, rendering the costs of finance unaffordable. The fair rate return methodology included within the state aid decisions enables the UDFs to adjust their own return levels to enable private investors to secure a preferential or priority return where a project would not otherwise be viable if funded on a purely commercial basis. The presence of a subordinated funder within a fund or project capital structure reduces the risk presented to the private investor and hopefully encourages them to invest where they might not otherwise. This theme will assess the benefits of this approach and it will also consider other methodologies for securing greater private investment alongside or in UDF activity. 
THEME - REGULATORY FRAMEWORK 
This theme will aim to increase knowledge and understanding of the regulations that affect financial instruments. It will also seek to track and influence the developing regulations and guidance for the use of financial instruments in the next programme. The JESSICA financial instruments that have been established in the current programme have all had to address the challenge of implementing investment funds within the Structural Fund regulations, which have been developed to enable funds to be provided by way of grant rather than loan. This has led to considerable uncertainty about how UDFs can ensure that their investment operations are compliant with the Structural Fund regulations. The regulatory position was in part clarified by the ‘Guidance Note on Financial Engineering Instruments under Article 44 of Council regulation (EC) No 1083/2006’ issued by COCOF on 21 February 2011. The guidance provided promoters of funds and Managing Authorities with some clarification of a number of key issues regarding the setting up and implementation of funds. It is expected that the next programme will provide a clear set of rules that build on existing guidance which captures synergies with other forms of support such as grants, and provides a clear framework for use of financial instruments to support urban development and other priorities. The Network will seek to respond to the developing regulatory framework, sharing experience through the transnational work to enable the cities to support and develop existing and new UDFs to use financial instruments to their full potential. In addition, a number of partner cities are seeking to develop innovative approaches to integrating different funding sources into an integrated programme. This may be through the development of Integrated Territorial Investment (ITI) or Community Led Development strategies or other innovative approaches, which could see the UDF blending different sources of funding such as ERDF and ESF at city level. This work will include consideration of social impact investment type approaches where investment that targets proactive early support for members of the community most in need is funded through financial instruments that are in turn supported by monetary savings resulting from a reduction in demand for ‘acute’ public services in the future. The Network will also seek to consider how local regulation can influence the operation of financial instruments in cities. This will include where regulation prevents UDFs being established, fiscal controls that limit the extent to which cities can directly benefit from financial instruments and planning and other regulations that impact on projects supported by UDFs. In addition to developing cities’ knowledge, sharing experience and building understanding of the risks associated with financial instruments, the Network will seek, through its Communication and Dissemination strategy to act as a voice for cities in the development of regulations and associated guidance for the next programme. 
THEME - ‘STANDARDISED FUND MODELS’ 
The draft Common Provisions regulation for the next programme of regional aid propose the development of standardised fund models that Managing Authorities will be able to utilise to establish financial instruments in their area. Such models will be one option available for Managing Authorities in addition to using existing UDFs and establishing further tailored new models. It is anticipated that the Network’s activity, which will seek to address the barriers to using financial instruments, will provide insights and solutions that should be reflected in the development of standard models in the future. This theme will therefore be considered throughout the implementation phase. As each theme reports its findings the implications for future models will be considered. At each transnational conference the findings of the theme leads will be used to develop a series of recommendations for future operation of financial instruments that can be developed further at Local Support Groups and inform the development of this final theme. The experience of the partner cities to date have already illustrated that different models will be appropriate for different projects. The Network will explore models for financial instruments that are both independent legal entities and separate blocks of finance within an existing institution. It will also look at models to provide a range of sectoral products such as investment finance for commercial development, infrastructure funds for long-term investment and funds targeted at smaller investment to businesses in renewal areas. These different models will each have their own specific characteristics and different solutions may be required in practice to achieve similar priorities in relation to the other key themes. This theme will also be an important part of the Communication and Dissemination Strategy for the Network, forming the basis of its engagement with the Commission, Managing Authorities and other key factors to influence the future shape and utilisation of financial instruments for cities. At partner level it is hoped that through the work plans of the LSGs and the transnational exchanges of the Network, partners will be able to test the different models and the applicability and feasibility for their own cities. 
CONCLUSION 
It is hoped that the themes identified during the partner visits and preparation of the baseline study and the work plan and methodology proposed will provide a solid and productive basis for the implementation phase of the Network. As has been outlined, it is envisaged that the transnational learning and exchange and thematic recommendations will be of interest and use not only to the partner cities but also wider stakeholders such as the European Commission, Managing Authorities and other cities.

"CTUR Cruise Traffic and Urban Regeneration of city port heritage.  
INTRODUCTION 
1. Port cities: cities on the move. 
For over two decades, European port cities have held an important place in urban current affairs. 1.1 Cities in crisis. The first headlines are both depressing and alarming. Developers and decision-makers need to find answers to the abandoning of large areas by port and industries, which are the most visible spatial impact of a crisis affecting all the components of cities. In the 1980s the drastic evolution of maritime transport (gigantic ships and containerization), the demands of spatial re-organization and both human and technical restructuring of ports, dismantling of large industrial units of production (steel industry, petrochemical industry, shipyards, etc.)… all strongly shook the socio-economic basis of port cities with an accumulation of negative indicators : demographic decline, unemployment, accentuation of the phenomenon of social exclusion, accelerated deterioration of old urban tissues. The figures in the table below show the extent of this crisis. 1.2 Cities undergoing change Halfway into the 1990s, the spectacular growth of maritime exchanges - with over 25 000 billion tons of merchandise travelling by sea and ocean annually - is favourable to ports, which all show a rise in activity. Container traffic figures confirm this: between 1995 and 2005 this traffic went from 145 million T.E.U. (twenty equivalent unit) to 275 million with an average growth estimated at 8.9% per year. With this new situation, port cities must invest in a double competition: one that the ports have to engage in order to secure and control maritime traffic, and one that drives the cities to reinforce their position on the European territory. Whilst it is in fact shown that economic renewal of cities doesn’t always follow the mechanic progression of traffic (A. Lemarchand, 2006), the news of port cities isn’t any less festive, with the media coverage in Europe of a series of inaugurations of new waterfront developments, replacing quaysides and docks abandoned by modern port functions. Barcelona, Genoa, Liverpool, Hamburg or Lisbon are all examples which confirm a waterfront revitalization phenomenon as the cornerstone of an ambitious regeneration project for the city as a whole. The challenge is first to make port-cities productive and no longer simple transit areas. In this way, the city-port interface becomes a real experimental support for the elaboration of strategies that are able to respond to socio-economic changes imposed by globalization. The challenge is also to solve the tensions between port functions and urban functions, to respond to inhabitants’ aspiration in terms of quality of life, housing and of provision of facilities and public spaces. In any case, the city-port interface, which was, yesterday, presented as a sterile and opaque boundary, now constitutes an « active fringe » around which there is a will to renew the form, the image and dynamics of the city. 
2. Cruise activity: a challenge for the renewal of the port city 
2.1 Cruise Traffic and Urban Regeneration (CTUR): genealogy of the topic 
The topic « Cruise traffic and urban regeneration », initially proposed by the city of Naples, is in the continuity of work carried out from 2005 to 2007 in the framework of the URBACT SUDEST working group, which focused on the study of the specificities of sustainable development of port cities. During this programme, the partners identified a tendency of the port cities to propose the city-port interface as a place where new metropolitan approaches are structured and where, in a way, « the future of the port city » is organized: - new specialized port terminals and large logistic zones are being created in the cities’ outskirts; - the more central sequences of city-port interface are subjected to urban interventions on a large scale which aim, among their priorities, to favour a diversity of functions: functional diversity vs requalified city neighbourhoods; functional diversity vs superior service sector and logistic functions ; functional diversity vs tourism, leisure activity and free time. In most situations, the intention is to develop or reinforce the diversity between port functions and urban functions. In many waterfront development projects, cruise activity is put forward as a strong element of the will of port cities to develop/reinforce the urban tourism industry. Cruise tourism has now become a new market for the ports. In the past 10 years, this market has literally exploded with over 10 million people who embark each year on large ships; the rate is estimated at 8% a year until 2010 (Seatrade, 2006). Let’s note that this phenomenon does not only concern the southern ports nor the ones disconnected from merchandise flows. It also concerns the northern ports and all the big trading ports. In Europe, the topic of cruise activity as a new economic and marketing stake for port cities and a support for urban regeneration, attracts much attention: - Firstly, as we will see in the section on the « state of the art », many comparative studies devoted to port city dynamics in Europe, underline the importance of it. As for the information disseminated by associations specialising in cruise tourism at international and European level, it demonstrates the size of cruise activity development and the importance of its economic effects. - Another indicator of the importance of the topic could be the number of European port cities having applied to the CTUR Network with more than 30 applications (partners included).  2.2 Cruises as a generator of urban tourism and an opportunity for the recovery of urban and port building heritage: CTUR themes of investigation and experimentation. Cruise tourism is a function which necessarily involves the city and the port as much in the definition of spatial organization for operational modalities as for the elaboration of a development strategy. Thus, to be included in the circuits, it is necessary to offer guarantees of port reliability, but also of a « global quality » of the stay. 1 – Its development assumes prior local political intervention. It is then a question of governance, between the « urban and territorial » public institutions, the port authorities, the local economic actors and civil society. As a matter of fact, developing cruise activity assumes a strong engagement from the public sphere and the private local one in the construction of the port city image and in the development of the territorial and urban infrastructures and facilities: international airport, the extent and quality of the hotel industry and the quality of transport connections from the city to the hinterland. Cruise tourism is also favourable to the emergence of cooperation between port cities. As a matter of fact the activity also depends on its inclusion in a « route », a network of cities having convergent interests. 2 – Cruise tourism has close links with urban tourism: the flow of persons it generates is conditioned by the quality of the city’s cultural offer. In the past years, many city ports, whatever their rank in the urban hierarchy, have concentrated on the creation of cultural facilities of national or even international importance. The Guggenheim museum at Bilbao is the best example of this well marked tendency. The urban-port heritage intervenes here as a favourable component in the affirmation of the identity of the places and the offer of a new experience for visitors. For some cities (Naples, Barcelona, Amsterdam, etc.), the presence of an exceptional « historic » urban heritage allows them to establish their tourist reputation. But other cities find it more difficult to bring out artistic and cultural interest in their built environment. For the latter cities, the solution is to give value to the industrial and port heritage, which have a strong identity and social value, and are always seen as a curious and exotic place by visitors, and which need to be transferred into a cultural or leisure field. Nonetheless, there is the question of reuse of these large structures and the capacity of medium-sized cities to absorb them. The commercial function in its most innovative aspects can help to reinforce the preservation and the enhancement of the largest historic port structures. The warehouses and the docksides can be opportunities to revitalize and diversify commercial facilities in the heart of the cities. By associating medium and up market specialist shops with an environment empowered by a strong identity (built heritage and docks), these achievements are offered today as a new kind of urban focal point. 3 – As for employment, the cruise market, and the urban tourism it generates, requires specific and qualified professional competences: - in the training of cruise personnel (on board and land-based); - in urban services (hotel industry, catering industry, business industry, etc.) ; - in the transport sector on a local, regional, national and international level ; - in the servicing of ships (supplies, etc.); - in the activities of naval industry and other industry (purchases by cruise lines). This assumes the setting up of specific professional training open to the local population so as to maximize the social effects in the city.  
SYNTHESIS 
1. Network CTUR: a representative sample A heterogeneous sample… 
At first sight, the partners of the CTUR network constitute a heterogeneous sample in terms of urban and port reality. The “population” criterion distributes the port cities into 5 main categories : - national capitals of northern Europe with more than 500 000 inhabitants (Dublin, Helsinki); - regional capitals of southern Europe with more than 800 000 inhabitants (Naples, Valencia); - cities with a population between 200 000 and 350 000 inhabitants, region capital (Varna, Trieste, Rostock) or not (Alicante); - a peripheral city with about 160 000 inhabitants included in the metropolitan area of Porto (Matosinhos); - a medium-sized city with about 55 000 inhabitants, capital of an island of the Greek archipelago (Rhodes). The “port traffic” criterion distributes the port cities into 3 main categories: - non-specialized and trans-national main port characterized by their high traffic level in containers (Valencia; Dublin); - non-specialized ports that are important at national and trans-regional levels (Helsinki, Leixões, Naples, Trieste, Rostock); - ports that are important at regional level, non-specialized (Varna, Valencia) or more or less specialized (Rhodes). The “passenger traffic” criterion distributes the port cities into 4 main categories: - ports with a total passenger traffic higher than 8 million passengers (Naples, Helsinki); - ports with a cruise traffic higher than 1 million passengers (Naples) and higher than 300 000 (Helsinki), in lead position in the Mediterranean and the Baltic regions; - ports with an increasing cruise traffic of about 100 000 passengers (Alicante, Dublin, Rostock, Valencia); - ports recently opened to cruise traffic (Rhodes, Varna, Leixões). With such a heterogeneous sample, that is to say there is nothing to compare and exchange between the partners? First of all, it is worth stressing that the will of the port cities to participate and to encourage the CTUR network implies that they have altogether the same feeling of belonging to a common reality, which is an essential basis to exchange questions and experiences. Thus, the latest period of crisis of the urban-port system everywhere in Europe (and in the world), and the needs of an adjustment to the globalization dynamics, have encouraged the port cities to come together in order to think on common issues and, probably, to share a relative common fate. Therefore, despite their urban differences and port realities, the port cities involved in the CTUR network constitute a relevant sample: - all the port cities identify the port as a strong component of their local economy, culture, society and identity. - all of them are currently involved in an ambitious project to redevelop the port-city interface in accordance with a sustainable approach, transforming often derelict port and industrial areas into new urban quarters, or trying to improve the relationships between hard/soft port functions with the urban neighbourhoods. - all of them are experiencing a significant increase in cruise traffic and are elaborating strategies to control and stimulate its impacts on the local economy as well as possible . In this way, the network CTUR represents a well-balanced sample allowing to study and exchange on the features of the different European cruise markets: the Baltic market (Rostock, Helsinki), the Atlantic North market (Dublin, Matosinhos Leixões), the Mediterranean market (Alicante, Valencia, Naples, Rhodes, Trieste), and the Black Sea market (Varna). - most of the port cities have a broad urban heritage that sometimes benefits from an international label (Naples; Rhodes); all of them have initiated specific policies to enhance and promote it. In any case, the port heritage is recognized as an essential component of the urban identity and, currently, it is the subject of particular care. 
2. Key problems and challenges within the CTUR theme 
The port cities of the network CTUR are not at the same development level of cruise activity and are not at the same stage in the implementation of their projects. Nevertheless, their key problems and challenges concerning the general adaptation of the port cities in physical, socio-economic, cultural and managerial terms to the requirements of the cruise sector are similar. Planning and spatial organization. Planning the waterfront revitalisation (including derelict industrial areas) in an overall approach of the port city development. Bringing the cruise traffic to the core of the city, improving the connection between the cruise terminal and the city centre or developing the cruise infrastructures most closely with the city centre. Improving the urban accessibility to the cruise terminal and, more generally, to the port in terms of efficient collective transports and in term of quality (landscape; security) of the pedestrian ways. Improving the organization of the passenger port separating cruise traffic and ferry traffic. ??Rationalizing the organization of the port functions setting up the hard functions in a suitable location and taking into account their environmental impacts. Transforming a port-industrial derelict area into a new city quarter. Mixing housing and cruise traffic in a same area and, more generally, creating a mix between maritime and urban activities within the framework of an integrated approach of sustainable development. Conceiving new cruise terminals as open doors between the port and the city. Improving the infrastructures and facilities of the passenger terminal to strengthen the position of the port city on the cruise market and to become a major “home port”. ??Developing urban facilities in the port area without compromising the requirements of security Governance and management. Enhance the governance efficiency to stimulate local energies. Encouraging the partnerships between the port authority and the municipality, between the several public bodies and between the public and private actors. In nearly all cases, the challenge is to associate all the public actors in a global project. Associating the citizens in the port-city strategy and/or project(s) and identifying the local population as the main target of the economic and social impacts of the cruise activity (research of methodological approaches). Economic and social challenges. Developing the cruise activity as a new employment sector. Awaking the interests of the local population (inhabitants and economic actors) to the cruise activities and its potential economic and social impacts. Harmonizing the time of the city and the time of the cruise call considering that in same cities the shops are closed between 2 p.m. and 4 p.m., and, in almost cases, on Sunday. ??Developing/strengthening the cruise industry sector in the port city offering training courses and vocational educations adapted to the specific skills required (land based and on board jobs). In this way, it means encouraging first and foremost the access of young people (training courses) and low qualified workers (vocational education) to the employment opportunities. Adapting the employment in the cruise sector to the new nationalities of the passengers Tourist promotion of the port, the city and its neighbourhoods. Increasing the image and the attractiveness of the port city as a vibrant and “unique” destination at the international level. Promoting the image and the attractiveness of ordinary inner cities or neighbourhoods to neutralize the “jump effect” towards more famous destinations. Enlarging the impacts of the cruise traffic to the regional hinterland offering original tours and diversifying the tourist offers. Taking the opportunity of a major media event to redevelop the quality of the port-city interface, to enhance the urban and port heritage and to improve the quality of life in the derelict neighbourhoods. Improving the tourist potentialities and cultural facilities to transform the city into a cruise destination. Proposing the waterfront as a tourist and recreational place. Promoting the cultural heritage of the city and proposing it as an original and interesting one to the cruise tourists. In this way, it means imagining new itineraries in the city allowing the discovery of the urban heritage and all the cultural places. Bringing up the level of tourist services to improve the well-being of the cruise tourists in the port and in the city. Enhancement of the urban and port heritage. Enhancing the industrial port heritage by elaborating specific inventories. Researching innovative practices to re-use the original port and industrial “icons” (silos, shipyards, power stations, etc.). Improvement of the quality of life and environmental components. Improving the quality of life for the communities living in the surrounding areas of the cruise terminal and, more generally, living on the port-city interface. Resolving problems of pollution and contaminated areas. 
3. Themes and sub-themes to exchange 
From the key problems and challenges, three general thematic routes can be identified to approach the topic of “Cruise traffic and port city heritage as a key for the sustainable regeneration of the port city” in its entirety. Therefore for each main topic, many practical sub-themes have been identified by the partners in their baseline study and during the two meetings of the CTUR network. 1 - Transforming, regenerating, adapting the physical and environmental components of the “port-city system”: Enhancing the attractiveness of the port city: creation/modernization of port infrastructures and facilities in favour of the cruise traffic, improvement and strengthening of cultural and commercial infrastructures, insertion of recreational and cultural places in the port territory, and neutralization of the negative “gateway” effects. Improvement of the port accessibility (multimodal transport connection) and of passenger mobility, and reinforcement of the safety inside the port and on the port-city interface. Development of functional diversity on the port-city interface and port obsolete areas. Protection and enhancement of the port buildings heritage: re-use the industrial and port “totems” as high value “containers”, and enhancing the iconic and identity value of the port. Resolution of problems of pollution and contaminated areas. Management of negative cruise traffic impacts on the environment. 2 - Planning and managing the cruise development within a global port city project. Institution of a good (better) governance between port, city and other local stakeholders including the citizens. Development of public-private partnerships in economic and social matters. Conception of new tools to allow, encourage and integrate the participation of the citizens in the decision-making process. Conception of innovative planning tools to transform and organize the city port in an integrated vision. Creation of innovative communication tools to promote, in a global dimension, the port city and its features (specific know how and skills; tourist potentialities, etc.). 3 - Cruise traffic and port heritage as economic and social generator. Evaluation of the cruise and tourism impacts on the local/sub-local economy in order to identify strengths and weaknesses and build an efficient port city strategy (Research of methodological approaches). Development of the cruise industry sector in the port city revitalising the maritime tradition and know how in a global approach: attracting the cruise industry head-quarters; proposing training courses and vocational education adapted to the skills required by the cruise industry and tourism activities associated (land based and onboard jobs; skilled jobs in the tourist sector, etc.). Awakening the local economic sphere to the cruise challenges: offer of specific products and services; adaptation of the time of the city to the cruise calls; proposing innovative tourist guides and routes; consciousness raising to re-use the port heritage in an economic but also in a social way. Allowing and encouraging the access of young and low-qualified workers to the employment opportunities in the cruise and tourism sectors. Orienting the positive cruise and tourist impacts towards the derelict neighbourhoods. Offer of social housing in mixed programmes developed on the obsolete port areas.

"2nd Chance – Waking up the ""sleeping giants"": Starting position This chapter starts with an introduction why the issue of voids and vacant buildings in Europe matters from the EU level point of view (chapter 1.1). This is followed by a brief overview about opportunities these vacant buildings provide for the European city, but also with which challenges cities are confronted to reactivate them (chapter 1.2). This is followed by some good-practice examples and initiatives, which have already successfully strived for the reactivation of vacant buildings (chapter 1.3). 
1.1 The EU context and EU policies Urban areas are becoming both the causes and solutions of the current environmental and social crisis and future cities will also have to deal with limited urban spaces and resources. In order to cope with these environmental and urban crises, a paradigm shift in conventional urban regeneration is essential. As the EU has entered the post-industrial age, decline of manufacturing industry, suburbanization, changing urban policies and planning systems, this has resulted in producing diverse spectrums of underused and abandoned urban spaces, so called “voids”. Voids can be fallow land, vacant lots, reserved areas, unused open space, space between public and private realms or vacant buildings, which have no permanent use or have fallen out of use. The radical restructuring of global economy in recent decades has resulted in an explosion in the number of such spaces. In 2014, British media published an article, stating that across the EU, enough houses are lying empty to house all of the EU's homeless people1. Housing statistics in the EU (2010)2 showed that in 6-8 % of conventional dwellings in European countries are vacant. Inefficient decision making, lack of corresponding policies, poor land management, poor co-ordination among decision makers, public and private stakeholders as the main policy problems have not given answers how to turn these underused and abandoned urban spaces, which have often lost its original purpose, into opportunities for a sustainable urban development. Because these voids present a great opportunity for the European city: the recycling and reusing of these abandoned urban spaces can be one pathway for greater resource efficiency and new, sustainable growth as important contribution for a resource efficient Europe. These urban voids can be strategic places for the redevelopment of cities and neighbourhoods. Re-using derelict land and widely abandoned buildings can contribute heavily to sustainable development by supporting a compact settlement structure and urban renewal; pushing more resource efficient cities by using the grey energy of the existing building stock instead of building a new one, by improving the energy efficiency of the building through its rehabilitation. This support a more efficient use of urban resources: land and energy. providing space for economic, social, cultural and environmental uses and needed functions in the city / neighborhood ; protecting European cultural heritage as these vacant buildings often have cultural heritage values; developing new cooperative planning processes between city administration, citizens, NGOs and economic operators to give them an active role in shaping the urban development through the revitalisation of such buildings. There are also social aspects in all that. As vacant, abandoned buildings and sites have no official use anymore, there are “open” for something new. They present an opportunity to develop the site also for the benefit of the common goods, within the interests of the people and neighborhood needs. Thus, these sites can contribute for example for the provision of affordable housing or for providing space for start-ups, cultural activities, etc., generating new job opportunities for the community. Thus, it needs policies in the cities which actively seek to use the opportunities of these voids, in particular reusing empty, abandoned buildings, and develop them with the notion of the above mentioned issues to take advantages of them as strategic places for a sustainable renewal of our cities and neighborhoods. The 2nd Chance network wants to make a contribution to it by helping its partners to reactivate their larger vacant buildings and building complexes in the city in support of a sustainable urban development under the notion of the common good, and to develop policies, which actively make use of the opportunities these buildings provide. Because due to the size of these vacant buildings they can provide space for a variety of needed functions; all this within the existing building stock and the city limits. At European level currently the sustainable building initiative is probably the closest to the topic of the network. In the beginning of 2015 DG ENV, DG GROW and the Joint Research Centre called for interest to establish a main stakeholder group to support a study on “Resource efficient Buildings” during 2015- 2017. The aim of the study is to develop a common EU framework for building environmental performance indicators to drive improvements in both new and refurbished buildings. One specific objective of the study is to support more intensive use of buildings in order to reduce the need for further built environment, e.g. use empty buildings instead of building new, use buildings for more than one purpose when suitable, build flexible buildings to be adapted to new functions or changing needs when appropriate. The study responds to the need identified in the Communication ‘Resource Efficiency Opportunities in the Building Sector’ COM (2014)4454 for a common European approach to assess the environmental performance of buildings throughout their lifecycle. There are further EU policy initiatives, but with the focus mainly on the improvement of the environmental performance of buildings in terms of energy efficiency: for example, the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive5 (EPBD) obliges Member States to apply minimum requirements on the energy performance of new and existing buildings. To support EU Member States in implementing the EPBD the European Commission has established the BUILD UP initiative6. The BUILD UP web portal is intended to reap the benefits of Europe's collective intelligence on energy reduction in buildings for all relevant audiences. It brings together new practitioners and professional associations while motivating them to exchange best working practices and knowledge and to transfer tools and resources. Also financial instruments at European level to improve the energy performance in buildings have been established. The European Investment Bank (EIB) provides intermediated lending and risk-sharing instruments combining loans with grants and providing technical support (i.e. European Energy Efficiency Fund7 (EEEF) or Joint European Support for Sustainable Investment in City Areas (JESSICA)). The European Union provides financial support through the Structural and Cohesion Funds for energy-efficiency and renewable-energy investments, not only in public and commercial buildings, but also in existing housing. Another programme of the EU, providing funding for buildings, is Intelligent Energy Europe9 (IEE). In the last decade several EU initiatives have dealt with brownfield developments and temporary uses which have intersections with the 2nd Chance topic. For project examples see chapter 1.3. 
1.2 Challenges, Opportunities, Objectives Challenge & Opportunity In many European cities smaller and larger derelict, vacant, underused sites and premises can be found in or near the city centre. These sites often have a negative impact on their surroundings. On the other hand they present a great opportunity: vacant primarily means empty, but also free and therefore full of opportunity. The voids can be used to complete a compact settlement structure, to confront limited urban spaces and resources, to provide space for needed functions in the city. Large buildings and building complexes that have lost their original purpose, are in decay and derelict, but are at the same time the prime opportunity within voids to support a sustainable city and neighborhood development. Because of their size they can provide space for a variety of needed social, economic and ecological as well as cultural functions. They can provide space for social and economic activities, space for neighborhood groups and activities, space for cultural industry, for start-ups, for alternative uses, etc. Further, they are often landmarks or identity anchor points; they often have great potential for the urbanisation of neighborhoods and the galvanisation of actors. Their revitalisation can blaze a trail for the careful use of space and energy, using the grey energy of the building instead of building a new one. Often these larger buildings are also older buildings with cultural heritage value, which should be safe-guarded through proper rehabilitation and reuse. But these larger buildings and building complexes are often too large to be redeveloped at one time and (financially) too heavy for just one investor. This results in a further decay of the building, up to the extent that they are a security hazard and an “eyesore” for the city. Also long period of abandonment increase social and economic expenses and causes further negative impacts on its surroundings. These voids might be both in public and in private hands. The challenge is to reactivate those ""sleeping giants"" for a resource efficient sustainable growth and for the benefit of the urban (neighborhood) development. It is about to bring these larger buildings and building complexes in use again, to rehabilitate/retrofit them, to improve the energy efficiency, providing space for what is needed in the neighborhood / in the city, to support an appropriation through indefinite users, to support strategic uses of these premises, not only oriented on private exploitation interests, but also on the interests of the common good. Particularly, the potential of local groups and initiatives has so far been underestimated and ignored. Cooperatives, builders' groups, associations or foundations invest capital not for the purpose of short-term profit expectations. Self-organised and with a great willingness to shape, they implement ideas of new living and housing models. Some of the projects have set themselves sustainable social and ecological tasks that hold out the promise of long-term benefit for the city also in economic terms. These local groups are to be activated and involved for the revitalisation of these ""sleeping giants"". The challenge and questions of the 2nd Chance network are: Embedding the reuse of the property in the urban / neighborhood development context. What are the city development objectives and perspectives? What are the objectives and needs for the neighborhood the property is situated? Which opportunities offer the reuse of the property for the city / neighborhood? Which sustainable/ demanded functions could be embedded? Could there be negative effects for the neighborhood because of the reuse/ new functions? How to identify the vacant buildings, which can be of best use for the urban/ neighborhood development? How to make understand that the reactivation is not only about economic development? Physical and economic adaptability of the property to new functions. What is the current physical state of the property? Can the property physically adapted to desired new functions/uses? Is this feasible? Engagement of stakeholders for the reuse of the property. How to identify, activate and engage appropriate stakeholders for the reactivation of a building? How to ensure a lasting cooperation with good communication and coordination between them (unlocking further ‘resources’ for the reuse)? How to activate/engage with property owner for the common reactivation of the property and to achieve a lasting cooperation for mutual beneficial use of the property? How can the public interest / the notion of urban commons be integrated in privately driven project developments? How to identify and coordinate the interests and engagement potential of the stakeholders? How to start the process that people start “taking over” the building? How to ensure the coordination within the different city administration units and the city council / mayor? How to involve universities / higher education to access their expertise / innovation? How to get hold of the buildings when the owner does not want to get active? How to attract and engage investors/ potential users? How to work with local/social media? Development of appropriate strategy, instruments and process for the reactivation of the property? Which policies / instruments are or should be in place to support the reactivation of the property? How to finance the whole process and the reuse/rehabilitation? What is the role of the municipality in the process of reactivation? How to monitor vacant properties / voids? Answering the questions during the 2nd Chance implementation phase will enable the partners to develop collaboratively a flexible development/ reuse strategy for the property, which is embedded in the strategic city and neighborhood development. The strategy can demonstrate alternatives for the reuse. The strategy will include a by all stakeholders accepted vision and objectives for the reuse of the property; (possible) functions/uses to be embedded in the building; strategy, actions, next steps to reactivate the property; financing the further process, etc. It is also possible that during the project certain new uses / functions are tested for example through temporary uses. Objectives Objective of 2nd Chance network will be to find out and try new approaches, new ways / instruments and planning methods to reactivate vacant larger buildings, building complexes or areas with many vacant buildings. The focus will be to develop Local Action Plans (LAP) how such vacant large building complexes can be revitalised together with the community/ different stakeholders for the benefit of the owner, the community, the entire city; how they can be revitalised step-by-step (letting them “grow” like a city) or how a development in cooperation with private property owner and the community could work. The network will develop further organisation and financing models to turn more local actors into players in the revitalisation of such buildings and to strengthen the local potential for innovation. This can provide impulses for new urban developments. The intersection of innovation potential of self-organised builders' groups and principles and experiences of cooperatives harbours an opportunity of creating affordable housing and other uses, such as cohousing, co-working, commercial start-ups of a wider quantitative impact, and finding ways of perpetuating such voluntary tasks and programmes also over generations. In the end, new bottom-up experiences of cities, at political level and administrative level, on “common goods / urban commons” could be another innovative tool useful for the renaissance of vacant large buildings. The intention of the network is to bring partners from European municipalities together which have derelict, underused premises with larger empty buildings, building complexes or areas with many vacant buildings near or in the city centre, which “resist” to be redeveloped. The network will support the partners to exchange experience, to share ideas and to develop new approaches how to activate these “sleeping giants” under consideration of the common good /urban commons. The partners are willing to look for alternative ways to activate and redevelop them. At local level partners will develop Local Action Plans (LAP) for the reactivation of the site/ buildings. The LAP could represent a flexible reuse strategy, embedded in the neighborhood/ urban development. The strategy could include a vision and objectives for the reuse of the property; (possible) functions/ uses to be embedded in the building; actions/ next steps to reactivate the property and implement the functions/ uses and financing possibilities for the further process and the rehabilitation of the building. The LAP will be implemented after the life time of the project. The LAP will be elaborated in close cooperation with relevant stakeholders by setting up a least a Local Support Group (called URBACT Local Group = ULG). The ULG will gather the local key stakeholders concerned by the reuse of the vacant premises. Potential members of the ULG could be divided into three categories: 1. Property owner/investor: private, institutional, public; 2. Municipality: mayor, city council, (urban planning, economic, social, cultural) department service provider of municipality / experts, (neutral) moderator of ULG; 3. Users & Supporters: citizens, neighbours/ inhabitants movements, (potential/ temporary) users, civic associations/ movements, NGOs, creative/ cultural sector, association of building sector, university, managing authority, public media. 
1.3 Good-practice examples for the reactivation of larger vacant buildings and sites. There are several examples in Europe about initiatives which have tried to bring derelict and vacant sites and premises in use. Often these initiatives pursue not only economic goals, but also have social, cultural and environmental goals in mind; thus contributing to the sustainable development, which provides new or alternatives opportunities for the urban population. 1.3.1 Examples for reactivation of vacant buildings HausHalten e.V., Leipzig, Germany Haushalten e.V. is a registered private association working for the preservation and rehabilitation of endangered late 19th century buildings in Leipzig. There motto is “A lot of space for little money”. Due to the leaving of more than 100.000 inhabitants after the fall of the wall in Germany in Leipzig there are many listed, architecturally important buildings, which are vacant since years. Many of them are in a process of decay. Due to the current surplus of available dwellings, the classical refurbishment of these buildings is currently uneconomic from the view of the owner. Thus, there is little prospect of classical redevelopment and re-use. At the same time there are creative individuals with alternative lifestyles and living requirements which typical rental conditions cannot accommodate. Such individuals require premises whose conditions are below or different from what typical users would be interested in. Although there is obviously a need for accommodations for such individuals, there is typically very little on the market. HausHalten e.V. has developed initiatives as the “Guardian Houses” (Wächterhäuser) to ensure the safety and preservation of the endangered buildings and the acquisition of new tenants for these buildings on a noncommercial basis. The main activity is to bring owners and tenants for the re-use of these buildings together, taking into account the following aspects: - Preservation of cultural monuments and the urban landscape - Owner consultancy - Provision of stimulation for urban districts - Promotion of employment and new businesses - Copying the concept The basic principle of the Guardian Houses is the provision of houses through usage. The house occupants become the guards of the house. Their presence helps prevent vandalism, limits weather damage and insures general maintenance. Since general wear and potentially damaging problems are discovered by the occupants early, they are minimized. The users take responsibility for the preparation, operating costs and refurbishment of the property. In most cases the owners allow the users to inhabit the flats free of rent. For Haushalten e.V. people who have a special social, cultural, or commercial attraction for these quarters of the town are of special interest as guards for these houses. Such users are free to design and refurbish the houses according to their needs and aesthetics. This makes them bring their craft and arts skills to the improvement of the buildings. The labour and maintenance of the apartments and remaining areas of the house become the reimbursement to the owners of the house in lieu of rent. The owners benefit, by being relieved of the running costs and concern of the day-to-day maintenance of the house. The owner’s responsibility rests with arranging for the provision of electrical, heating and water supplies to the houses. In some situations owners are able to secure funds for contribution towards making the house basically usable. The model’s key points at a glance: - An interim tenancy contract between the owner and HausHalten e.V. - The building is usually let rent free for the term of the contract - Rights of use and brokerage are transferred to the association - All ownership rights and property duties remain with the owner - An option to prematurely terminate the contract in well founded, individual cases. - Agreement with “house guardians” to pay the occurring operating costs of the building - Independent repair input in the building interior - Control of the unused parts of the building - Paying membership of HausHalten e.V. With such an initiative HausHalten e.V. has provided space for example for the private association Buchkinder e.V., which designs and prints books jointly with children. Noncommercial galleries occupy shop premises, which have established contacts with each other and to KUHTURM, a project run by students. A theatre has settled down as the association Beistandsleistungen e.V. which provides services to eastern European artists and migrants, start-up businesses like the vegan imbiss and new entrepreneurs interested in favourable conditions for establishing their enterprise. Thus, these “Wächterhäuser” have promoted new cultural and social projects and initiativesand linkages between them, which provides a new push for the sustainable development of the area by reusing derelict buildings at the same time. This approach has been transferred to other cities in Germany and it applied successfully there. Further information: www.haushalten.org/de/english_summary.asp Camelot Europe – vacant property specialists Camelot Europe is an international property management services provider, offering a broad range of property management and advisory services to their clients with vacant property. They follow a similar approach as HausHalten e.V. but with a profit orientation. As service to owners with vacant properties they offer “Property Guardian”, which works as follows: - They acquire inhabitants, so called “property guardians”, which are going to live or work for a certain length of time in the building for 1/3 of the average rent in the region. - They manage all contracts and legal agreements between Camelot, the property owner and the Property Guardians. - They manage the relationship with the Property Guardians from the day they view the property and sign the contract, to the day the property is handed back and they move out. Camelot has a strict selection process for the “Property Guardian” to ensure that only reliable individuals act as property guardians. Property guardians are expected to look after the property responsibly. Their main role is to ensure there are no security breaches and that the property is well maintained prior to its ultimate use, immediately reporting issues as they arise. Camelot has following requirements to the property. The property is wind and water tight. It is not vandalised or derelict and basic facilities are in place: electricity and water. For a small start-up fee they install basic 'wheel-in, wheel-out' shower pod units for temporary washing facilities. In addition they use vacant buildings for filming and photo locations, as event space and for pop up stores. Also, together with the property owner they transform outdated vacant buildings for temporary as permanent uses. Several projects in UK, Germany, France, the Netherlands have been implemented. The website “[im]possible living”, supported by an app, is a developed crowd-assisted map site that is identifying vacant properties all over the planet, currently mostly in Italy. The site is trying to play matchmaker between abandoned spaces and people with ideas to revive those spaces, and maybe even some of the money they'll need to get things going. At the website people can map an abandoned building they would like to reactivate and provide further information about the building like a detailed profile including size, location and state of decay. Other people can look for abandoned buildings. Together they can share and commonly develop ideas to reactivate a particular building. In addition to the website, bicycle tours in Bologna and Milan to abandoned properties have taken place as well as a workshop10 with a group of architecture students to plot out ways how abandoned properties could legally be redeveloped and what kinds of uses could occur. Based on the websites first buildings have been already reactivated. City of Leipzig, regeneration of Halle 14 (text from aeidl) The Halle 14 project is part of a large brownfield regeneration project, namely the reconversion of Europe’s (once) largest cotton mill complex in Leipzig (‘Leipziger Baumwollspinnerei’). It is a good example of how brownfield development and creative industries can be used as impetus in a wider urban regeneration. Main objective of the city and the project promoter was to regenerate the historical (and listed) Halle 14 building which was in a precarious state. In order to support the (existing) efforts made by the private owner and by nonprofit organisations in the Halle 14 building, the city of Leipzig – supported by the European Regional Development Fund with 278 000 € (2009-2011) – helped in renovating the building’s façade and windows as well as creating a ‘training room’ for cultural/artistic purposes with a total budget of some 373 500 €. The training room is now an anchor point for various activities for local communities, particularly for children and young people. The ERDF investment forms only one part in the joint efforts to regenerate the Halle 14 building, including improving the building’s energy performance. Total investment into the building from public and private sources amounts to approximately three million €. This five-storey industrial building with a total floor-space of 20 000 m² is centrally located on the cotton mill site. Since the beginning of the 1990s, artists and others involved in the creative sector have built a productive and lively community at this location. It is renowned for being the home of the ‘Neue Leipziger Schule’ (new school of Leipzig) of German painter Neo Rauch. As an independent art centre, Halle 14 should contrast with the now successful galleries and commercial creative companies by serving as a centre for non-profit organisations and young artists. Regular exhibitions, an art library, the art education programme ‘Kreative Spinner’, the scholarship programme Studio14 and the Lounge14 discussion series form elements of the wider Halle 14 project. The project shows how a strongly integrative process, based on mutual trust and support, can make a real difference. A joint vision of private and public bodies for the regeneration 
1.4 2nd Chance network: What will it be about The 2nd Chance network is about the reactivation of larger vacant buildings, building complexes or areas with many vacant buildings, that have lost their original purpose, are in decay and constitute in their current state a problem / challenge for the city and the property owner. At the same time these buildings present a unique opportunity for the sustainable urban development. As these buildings are vacant, they can provide space for needed functions and uses, which so far could not “find its place” in the city or in the neighborhood. In particular due to their size these vacant buildings can provide space for a variety of social, economic, ecological or cultural functions; all this within the existing building stock and the city limits. Thus, the network is about to reactivate these buildings and embed the reactivation in the city / neighborhood development context. This means to provide space in the buildings for functions and uses which are needed in the neighborhood or in the city in general; to support strategic uses of the premises, which bring the interests of the property owner together with the public interest (i.e. interest of the community; notion of common goods). In deprived or neglected neighborhoods in the best case the reactivation of the vacant buildings can be used and present a starting point for the revitalisation of the entire neighborhood. As these buildings are vacant since a longer time and most often are derelict, it needs new stakeholders and to create a new momentum to be able to start off the process of reactivation in a step-by step-process. First/additional users have to be identified, which allow to receive revenues for first rehabilitation actions and/or which support the rehabilitation of the building by themselves or which attracts new uses, which bring further/higher revenues to be used for the rehabilitation process. To build up such partnerships and prepare a participative reactivation process, which allows making us of the opportunities these vacant buildings present, is one focus of the network. Thus, the partners will concentrate on a single building / site to learn from this process (in most cases in form of a pilot project) how to deal in principle with vacant buildings and bring them back in use in favour of the sustainable urban development. The pilot project might be used to develop guidelines, policies and instruments in support of the reactivation of vacant buildings in general in the city. This kind of reactivation of vacant buildings will allow using more efficiently the space of cities, combating further land use consumption and urban sprawl and at the same time improve the neighborhood and city development. of the entire neighborhood was the foundation of all rehabilitation activities on the cotton mill area. Considering the context of brownfield regeneration, the project also shows that taking a step-by-step approach is sometimes smarter than a ‘big-bang’. The former cotton mills complex is, due to its sheer size and need for physical regeneration, a major challenge for every investor. Tackling this aspect with a demand-based, step-by-step approach proved to be a smart solution.

"DIET FOR A GREEN PLANET
Södertälje Municipality has converted its public kitchens to the Diet for a Green Planet concept, which means environmental and climate friendly food with high quality.  This has been done without increasing the budget for the operational costs, and has been possible through structural changes and more professional staff. A key factor was the cooperation with the BERAS Implementation project, during which funding was given during three years for developing the concept, for training and for knowledge exchange both on national and international level in the Baltic Sea region
. General context  
Diet for a Clean Baltic / Diet for a Green Planet  
The “Diet for a Clean Baltic” concept was developed by the BERAS projects in the context of the EU Baltic Sea Region Strategy. However, it is one which is applicable in all corners of the world as “Diet for a Green Planet”. These names refer to the same concept. “Diet for a Clean Baltic”, which is used when referring to the work performed in or by BERAS, while “Diet for a Green Planet” is used when looking forward and describing this project.  
Diet for a Green Planet in short 
 Food and agriculture accounts for a significant part of global environmental challenges including climate change, biodiversity, nitrogen and phosphorus leakage. Thus, changes in food production and consumption can be a driver for sustainable development. This realization forms an important basis for Södertälje Municipality’s decision to make public meals more sustainable. The Diet Unit of Södertälje has had a key role in the development of this practice by successfully implementing it in public kitchens (schools, kindergartens and homes for elderly care). The practice has changed attitudes around food and shown a potential to be a powerful tool for combating climate change and other key global ecological challenges. At the same time it has raised the general quality of the food served, promoted health and empowered the kitchen staff – all within the same strict food budget.  Through projects that the Diet Unit has been involved in and through close cooperation with the BERAS projects, the development of the practice has had a continuous connection to research, global network resources and especially the Baltic Sea Region. Thanks to this, the Diet for a Green Planet concept stands on sound scientific ground. The concept is closely connected to two other concepts developed within the BERAS projects – Ecological Recycling Agriculture (ERA) and Sustainable Food Societies (SFS). ERA is – simplified – organic regenerative agriculture practices with additional requirements of balanced crop rotation and balance between animals and crop production. SFS is the further local societal development, where the food chain and especially the farmer are put in focus in a Triple Helix development. For further information on these concepts, see www.beras.eu.  
The basic principles of Diet for a Green Planet are: Good and healthy food. For food to be popular and make an impact, it must be well prepared and well balanced. Organically grown and ideally from Ecological Recycling Agriculture (ERA) farms. Less meat, more vegetables and wholegrain. The animals are needed on the farm, but the number of animals should not exceed the farm’s capacity to grow its own fodder. A benchmark is for a maximum 20% of the ingredients to be meat and fish. Seasonal food. Products which can be produced in an environmentally friendly and energy efficient way, in the area where the consumer lives, are automatically seasonally appropriate. Locally produced. The definition of “local” varies according to product and market. A maximum of 50 to 250 kilometers from the consumer is a rough measure.  ? Reduced waste. Wastage must be minimized; in production, processing, distribution, catering and from the plate itself. The food waste that is still generated should be recycled to the greatest extent (animal fodder, biogas production etc.).  This concept has shown to be applicable anywhere in the world (projects for adaptation to Dominican Republic/Haiti, Ladakh in north India and Tamil Nadu in south India are under start-up) since its principles are dynamic and obviously require local adaptation work.  An interesting aspect of this strategic and implementation oriented concept is that it – in a longer perspective – triggers engagement from the whole local society. It has far-reaching positive potential not only on the quality of the public meals but on the environment, on health, on local business life, on pedagogical approaches in schools and pre-schools and on general public awareness of the environmental footprint of food.  
The policy landscape  
The Diet for a Clean Baltic concept was developed within the BERAS Implementation project in the context of the EU Baltic Sea Region Strategy. This project – Diet for a Green Planet – targets the action ”Green Economy” in HA Sustainable development in the EUSBSR, contributing to realizing the potential of the BSR to be a model region for environmental, economic and socially sustainable development.  The project has a macro-regional approach to the problem of diversity with respect to socio-economic developments mentioned in the EUSBSR and it addresses environmental and socio-economic challenges with the help of integrated work in the food sector.  Furthermore this project supports the transition of the BSR into a sustainable and prosperous macro-region that results in “improved human well-being and social equity, while significantly reducing environmental risks and ecological scarcities”.  As pointed out in the CBSS strategy on Sustainable Development 2010-2015, lots of different interactions between urban, suburban and rural areas exist which call for better management of urban-rural linkages. This project contributes to increased coordination and synergy by supporting best practices and innovative development in the BSR involving public sector, NGOs, projects, business sector and research. Link to EU 2020 strategy. When it comes to the five targets for the EU in 2020, this project primarily contributes within “Climate change and energy sustainability”3. The main direction of the project in terms of topics related to the pillars of the EU 2020 strategy for innovative, sustainable and inclusive cities is “Developing Low carbon and energy-efficient urban economies”. However, Diet for a Green Planet also has the potential to contribute within other topics related to the pillars of the EU 2020 strategy: Promoting innovation and the knowledge economy (e.g. new business ideas in the tourism sector, new markets for local and sustainable food).Promoting social innovation (e.g. food as a tool for integration of immigrants). Promoting entrepreneurship (e.g. more local companies in the food sector). Enhancing urban planning performance (in particular urban-rural integration). Promoting the inclusion of specific groups (the key target group is staff in public kitchens – and they are to a large degree women from the immigrant population. Key target groups are also school students and elderly people). Fostering regeneration of deprived neighborhoods and combating poverty (free hot meals to all school children and students are a powerful and non-stigmatizing way of supporting the poor).  
Diet for a Green Planet – highly relevant for cities.  
Most food is produced in rural areas, but consumed in cities. If the global problems with climate change, eutrophication of the seas etc. are to be tackled, we need to see systemic changes in production, but also in consumer awareness and behavior. This creates a link between the rural and urban areas that is absolutely vital if a change is to come. And even more so since the detachment between rural and urban areas is just getting bigger. Farmers and agricultural experts cannot accomplish the necessary transition unless there is a strong and dedicated support from consumers in cities. Urban citizens need to understand where the food comes from, and what the consequences are in different kinds of production methods – that our daily choices of food matter. Concepts like Diet for a Green Planet have an important role to play here. It raises awareness and offers concrete solutions for consumers and other members of society in cities. Södertälje is a good example of this. On the one hand it offers groundbreaking and state-of-the-art organic agricultural practices and people (in the rural parts of the society) who are totally aligned with that type of thinking and consuming. On the other hand, citizens in downtown Södertälje have totally different (often opposite) attitudes and behavioral patterns.  More and more we see that cities consider food issues in urban planning and developing. The following is an extract from “Food, agriculture and cities: Challenges of food and nutrition security, agriculture and ecosystem management in an urbanizing world” (FAO, 2011):  “How is food and agriculture part of the “urban mix” of what local authorities and planners need to consider? Even where local administrators are dealing with overwhelming challenges in both poor countries and rich countries, the food sector became a priority. Local municipal governments often come to food and agriculture issues first in terms of urban and peri-urban agriculture, horticulture and forestry and there are many such projects and innovations underway across developing and developed nations. Recently, the food system considerations of local governments and planners have begun to include the rural dimension of food production and distribution, as most cities depend on rural food and fibre production for the majority of their food supply and long-term food and nutrition security.”4  Working to promote local food systems is also an issue of resilience of cities. As stated in the Report of the Special Rapporteur on the right to food, Olivier De Schutter during a session in the United Nations, Human Rights Council: “The strengthening of local food systems would also improve the resilience of cities. It is vital that cities assess their food dependencies, identify weaknesses and potential pressure points and, where possible, develop a variety of channels through which they can procure their food. Urban and peri-urban agriculture, as well as the development of short food chains connecting cities to their local food shed, will therefore play an increasingly important role.”5  Part of the solution  The contribution made by Södertälje municipality, reinforced by its partnership in the BERAS projects can be seen as part of a mosaic of ecological regenerative agriculture and food systems, which is what the world needs. As described in the UNCTAD report: “Trade and Environment review 2013” – “Wake up before it is too late – make agriculture truly sustainable now for food security in a changing climate”: “Developing and developed countries alike need a paradigm shift in agricultural development: from a ‘green revolution’ to a ‘truly ecological intensification’ approach. This implies a rapid and significant shift from conventional, monoculture-based and high external-input-dependent industrial production towards mosaics of sustainable, regenerative production systems that also considerably improve the productivity of small-scale farmers. We need to see a move from a linear to a holistic approach in agricultural management, which recognizes that a farmer is not only a producer of agricultural goods, but also a manager of an agro-ecological system that provides quite a number of public goods and services (e.g. water, soil, landscape, energy, biodiversity, and recreation)”.  In this UNCTAD report, more than 60 international experts contribute with their views to a comprehensive analysis of challenges and most suitable approaches for dealing holistically with the inter-related problems of hunger and poverty, rural livelihoods, social and gender inequity, poor health and nutrition, climate change and environmental sustainability.6  
Global perspective 
 To understand the many layers of the Diet for a Green Planet concept, we will provide a background, which accounts for the problems and challenges that our planet is facing today.  Half of the world’s CO2 emissions come from the food chain  Recent research put ever more emphasis on the food chain as a key for global environment challenges as climate change, biodiversity, water and key elements cycles (nitrogen and phosphorus). According to an FAO/OECD expert meeting in 20117, around half of the world’s CO2 emissions come from the food chain. See diagram below. This shows that:  1. The food sector is more important when it comes to climate change than many think.  2. All layers of the food sector play important roles. Actions need to be taken on an overall systemic level, rather than being focused on end-of-the-pipe solutions.   Modernization of agriculture – a threat to the seas. The modernization of Swedish and European agriculture in the past century has increased yields immensely. At the same time, agriculture’s current dependence on fossil energy and conventional cultivation methods with a specialization of farms to produce either animals or crops, and thus linear flows of energy and resources, has led to a uniform, biologically depleted agricultural landscape and a number of other negative impacts. Most serious of these impacts are reduced biodiversity, pollution of water and the air, the spread of toxins in the environment, climate-changing emissions and loss of soil fertility.  It is clear that agriculture must undergo a systemic change. Otherwise we risk cementing an untenable environmental situation and will lose, once and for all, the vital ecosystem services that the seas can produce. A solution to this problem must be able to go deep into the ecological system questions on the farm and at the same time engage the whole food chain to support the conversion on farm level, which in reality requires a conversion also in the food chain and in food habits.  The Baltic Sea is endangered. The Baltic Sea is a clear example of the negative consequences of a non-sustainable agriculture practice. The Baltic Sea basin gathers around 90 million people and it is affected by water flowing from 10 countries. Today it is severely suffering from eutrophication caused by leakage of nutrients from farms in the region. Today, around 30% of the bottom of the Baltic Sea is suffering from severe lack of oxygen. It is in fact dead. But it is important to note that the situation of the Baltic Sea is not unique. It is just one of many “dead zones” in the world. The number of known oxygen-starved areas has doubled since 1990 to nearly 150, according to the UN Environmental Program (UNEP)8. Hence, finding ways of combatting the eutrophication of the seas is highly relevant in all corners of the world. 
Evaluation framework  
The Diet for a Green Planet concept initiates change on many levels. On city level it integrates different sustainability issues into coherent actions in how the city purchases, prepares and serves food in public kitchens. On global level it is a systemic approach to tackle major environmental challenges such as food security and food quality, loss of biodiversity, soil erosion and degradation, eutrophication of seas and CO2 emissions. On an individual level it offers a way for people to develop awareness of how to eat tasty, healthy food at an affordable price that at the same time helps saving the environment.  
Overall long-term goal  
The overall long-term goal (reaches beyond this project) is a change in eating habits that supports a local and sustainable food production and environmental friendly development.  Final indicators for this overall long-term goal: Key stakeholder involvement reaches “ownership level” (see stakeholder involvement matrix below). Adopted Diet Policy by the municipality. Commitment of resources from the municipality. Signed contracts between municipality and local companies/associations/farms for e.g. product supply, canteen services, advisory services that are linked to the Diet for a Green Planet concept. The project objective final indicators (see below) will function as interim indicators for the overall long term goal.  
Project objectives  
In this time limited pilot transfer network project there are three main project objectives:  1. Practice transfer of the “Diet for a Green Planet” concept. This objective targets a wide group of relevant key stakeholders representing different sectors and competencies.  2. Getting politicians to start the process of outlining a diet policy in each of the receiving cities. This objective targets mainly local municipality representatives, but also other relevant stakeholders. 3. Long-term commitment to concept implementation. This objective targets a wide range of stakeholders on that may drive the process after project end.   A set of objectives, outputs that will support these objectives and final and interim indicators are listed in the tables below. These objectives, outputs and indicators are shared by all partners in the project. On local level, there may be further detailed versions or elaborations of these objectives and indicators, but the ones mentioned here encompass the common ambitions of the project network. 
Level of stakeholder involvement 
 In order to measure the progress of this project we have identified that stakeholder involvement is crucial to its success. There are several aspects to the involvement of the stakeholders: How many stakeholders are involved in the project work. The actual number is of interest. Which stakeholders are involved in the project work? Are stakeholders from different sectors and interests represented? How involved are the stakeholders? Here we have identified three levels of involvement: 1. Information, 2. Participation, 3. Ownership. Identifying the level of involvement will be valuable when evaluating the project and identifying key players when continuing work on the concept after the project. For this purpose we have created a matrix, which will indicate the stakeholder involvement according to the aspects above. See below. This matrix will be used on a local level in the giving and receiving cities, as well as on project level. 
Monitoring.  
The continuous monitoring of the progress of the project will be performed in different ways, among these are: Reports from transnational conferences, bilateral meetings and stakeholder exchange. Project Steering Committee meetings. Financial reporting. Partnership policy documents. List of participants in activities. Protocols from local activities. Informal contacts. The reports from bilateral meeting and transnational conferences together with Project Steering Committee meetings will provide us with the main framework for continuous monitoring of the progress in the receiving cities. These will bring up project critical issues and give room for bringing up difficulties and challenges along the way. On partner level as well as on network level.  
Who does what?  
A competent project organization has been built up at both Lead Partner and Project Partner level to make sure that the project monitoring functions well. The following key persons share the responsibility of continuously monitoring the progress of the project and gathering vital documentation:  Södertälje (Lead Partner) Sara Jervfors, Head of the Diet Unit in Södertälje Municipality: Project Coordinator. Sara is the person who got the clear mandate from Södertälje Municipality to implement the concept in the public kitchens – and also to work on achieving the adoption of a Diet Policy. Sara’s experiences are absolutely vital to a successful transfer of Södertälje’s good practice.  Daniel Dworetsky, Project Management and Communications, BERAS International. Daniel offers experience and expertise from the BERAS project and its valuable contribution to the creation of the concept.  Helena Nordlund, Lead Expert. Helena offers invaluable expertise when it comes to the six criteria of Diet for a Green Planet, the adaption of these criteria into local conditions and the ways and methods of successfully transferring a deep understanding of the concept. Helena has 20 years of experience from international projects and she recently finished a 30 month LEADER financed local implementation project (“Södertälje Locally Grown”) based on the Diet for a Green Planet concept. 
DIET FOR A GREEN PLANET is a Pilot Transfer Network within the URBACT II Programme, consisting of Södertälje in Sweden, Mollet del Vallès in Spain, Lomza in Poland and Molétai in Lithuania.  Diet for a Green Planet raises awareness of the environmental impacts of food on different levels. It uses existing resources and structures to increase the amount of environmental friendly consumption and reduce the climate effects of food. By using local resources and encouraging local and organic producers it also contributes to sustainable rural development and cooperation between urban and rural areas.  The overall project goal is to make relevant key stakeholders in each receiving city aware of and understand Diet for a Green Planet – and willing to act in accordance with the concept

"EGTC : Expertising Governance for Transfrontier Conurbations   

3. THE EGTC PROJECT. 

3.2 Definition of the theme and sub-themes. 
The development of cross-border conurbations and the improvement of the quality of life of their inhabitants call for an innovative approach to go beyond national boundaries. The EGTC URBACT project is dedicated to governance systems of cross-border conurbations enabling them to elaborate and implement common urban development strategies and consequently to improve the environment of their cooperation. The partners will work on the promotion of innovative governance tools in a panel of cross-border conurbations by identifying - all relevant stakeholders - how common diagnosis, strategies, organisation schemes are developed - the added value of public funding and legal tools (e.g. the European Grouping of Territorial Cooperation already put in place in the “Eurométropole Lille Kortrijk Tournai”) - the initiatives aiming to involve inhabitants and the civil society. This project will give cross-border conurbations in Europe, and particularly Project Partners, the opportunity to identify concrete results, successes and failures, the causes of such results, and to transfer those good practices into their own territory, so as to improve their governance system (institutionally, legally, financially…). Whereas some cross-border agglomerations are quite in advance in this process, some others, the European grouping of territorial cooperation (EGTC) is today the most elaborate legal tool enabling crossborder multi-level governance. The definition and implementation of policies through the EGTC will be an important topic of the Urbact Project. This project will aim to study : - How it could become a European tool of reference to support governance of cross-border conurbations? - How to organise the mobilisation of all human, political, legal, financial resources at EU, national, regional and local levels in order to achieve a sustainable development of cross-border agglomerations? The Project Partners will Work on the technical and political aspects related to the daily management of cross-border conurbation governance. We can identify two main strands divided in the following subthemes: - The management of the internal governance: partnership, staff and political organisation, articulation between political and technical levels, financial issues, informal or legal structuring of the cooperation (the opportunities of the European Grouping of Territorial Cooperation will be discussed), etc. - The leadership of the cross-border governance, the interface with external actors: participation of inhabitants, the civil society, the socioeconomic actors, the democratic accountability and the relationship between the co-ordinators of cross-border conurbation project and upper-level public authorities not involved directly in the internal governance (region, State, European programmes and institutions, etc), communication and medias 
3.3 Main challenges in relation with the governance of cross-border conurbations 
By promoting the involvement and cooperation of all relevant stakeholders, governance is essential for the definition and implementation of planning policies aiming to improve living condition, responding to populations’ needs and the global sustainability at the conurbation level. Extending into two or even three countries, the situation of cross-border agglomerations exacerbates the complexity of the problems faced by “national” conurbations. Cultural, political, legal, language… boundaries lead to “border effects”: growth of flows; competition between territories; economic and social interdependencies; different institutional, political, legal and cultural systems on either side of borders, etc. However it can also be a source of innovative methods in terms of urban management. Because of these distorsions and opportunities, cross-border cooperation actors have developed joint strategies and policies to ensure the quality of life of populations and more generally a better functioning of cross-border conurbations How to organise the dialogue between stakeholders in order to have a coherent approach – from the identification of common problems to the development of common solutions – enabling them to elaborate and implement sustainable policies for the whole cross-border agglomeration, so as to manage negative consequences of border effects and develop the potentialities? Governance tools appear to be an essential component for the implementation of efficient cross-border projects based on a horizontal (local private and public actors concerned at either side of borders) and on a vertical partnership (between European, national, regional and local levels, both political and technical ones). Which governance tools are available, enabling the stakeholders to build a political leadership, a long term vision and to have the necessary knowledge of the socioeconomic and cultural realities of the crossborder agglomerations? There is a need for innovation in so far as national legal and institutional environments do not take into account cross-border specificities. Coordination between national authorities of either side of borders may improve the synergy between urban planning policies, and sectoral policies such as transport, economic development, employment, health, culture and education, research, environment and services to population. Furthermore, it is important to ensure that the reality of cross-border agglomerations is taken into account in Cohesion policy programmes Objectives 1, 2, and 3 through partnership with urban local authorities in the programming bodies, funding of monitoring and territorial engineering. 
3.4 Expected outputs and results 
The outputs will be the result of a long-standing work and a strong involvement of all Project Partners supported by the Lead Partner and the Lead Expert, in relation with other cross-border conurbations in Europe when relevant. The discussions will deal with the themes and sub-themes depicted above (see point 2). The contents of the outputs will be defined through the following steps on the basis of the baseline study: - state of the art of common challenges and respective experiences, - exchange of ideas, experiences (success and failure) - assessment of the transferability of good practices - development of recommendations in order to adapt regional, national and European environments to urban cross-border realities In details: The Handbook, aiming to be disseminated at the EU level, will be divided into three parts: - some good practices, potentially transferable to other urban cross-border realities; - a common methodology to structure the governance of cross-border conurbations: some guidelines based on the experience of cross-border conurbations; - some recommendations addressed at the EU level, as an input to raise the awareness of the European institutions and actors on cross-border issues and on their expectations regarding the EGTC tool in the context of a modification procedure of the Regulation in 2011. The Local Action Plans (LAP) is the strategic plan on governance that will highlight, at the end of the project, the added value of the EGTC URBACT project for each cross-border conurbation in relation to the themes and sub-themes depicted above (see point 2). In another way, how will each cross-border conurbation integrate the good practices from other CB conurbations into its own governance system? The LAP will not be simply and necessarily the establishment of EGTC or another legal structure but a detailed description of expected actions enabling daily operational governance. This document will also contain recommendations addressed at regional and national levels in order to raise the awareness on specific urban cross-border challenges. The LAP will vary according to the needs and challenges of each cross-border conurbation. With respect to its nature, MOT will not elaborate a LAP but a report on the added value of the EGTC URBACT project and on the way it will take the results of this project into account in its own strategy (for more information on LAP, see the table in the appendix). Finally, a on-line bibliography on the EGTC URBACT project (inventory of available knowledge on governance in cross-border agglomerations) will be produced. To develop these outputs, several events will be organised (see point 6 on work programme). 
3.5 Approach and methodology 
The methodology is based on a web of multi-scale networks to allow for a multi-level dialogue and exchange of ideas and experience. Each level of network will provide for a platform for exchanges to the relevant actors. An interaction will be guaranteed between these different levels (mainly during the thematic workshops and the final conference). 3.5.1 At local level: stimulating culturally-embedded governance systems At the cross-border conurbation scale, the method will consist in structuring a strategic plan on governance (Local Action Plan) based on the work of a cross-border network of competences and legitimacies (Local Support Group). It will require an objective analysis of cross-border achievements and expectations in terms of territorial cohesion. The Local Action Plan will not be simply the establishment of a legal structure, including a European Grouping of Territorial Cooperation (EGTC) but a detailed description of expected actions enabling daily operational governance. The creation of registered organisations can be an objective, but it is also important to give a lot of emphasis to flexible partnerships to allow some networks reconfigurations. The contextual framework will be taken into consideration when defining the structural agenda of crossborder governance. Partnerships are culturally embedded and place-related, hence the necessity to integrate local realities when defining the needed constellation of actors and the participatory agenda of cross-border governance. Consequently, in parallel with the Local Action Plan, some work will be achieved in terms of place-related recommendations to stimulate an adaptation of the National/Regional contextual and legal environment. 3.5.2 At the European level: reinforcing a European knowledge society and public sphere At the European scale, the method will consist, firstly, in creating a knowledge network to secure the transfer of empirical good practices between the partners of the URBACT Project and also between the URBACT Project partners and other European cross-border conurbations having carried out innovative partnerships. As information is culturally-led and messages reconfigured through territorially-based identities, the transfer will not be simply a one-sided, but an interactive process enabling to discuss about transferability potential (i.e. capitalization of good practices). The knowledge network will be maintained during the whole duration of the project through events (conferences, Thematic Workshops), interactive communication tool such as the internet website and development of a common publication dedicated to good practices. Secondly, the EU scale will be also a level of cross-border conurbations partnership to single out the needed recommendations enabling an evolution of the contextual European framework. The recent creation of the EGTC tool by European Institutions with the consent of National States will not resolve all the legal/political/technical problems linked to cross-border spatial cohesion. There is a necessity to determine, at the EU level, recommendations stimulating an adaptation of public policies in favour of cross-border governance. The recommendations will make sense only if they are based on a legitimate network of National and EU competencies. Consequently, a European URBACT Support Group will be coordinated by the lead partner, MOT. That support group will associate European Union representatives and National/Regional law-making institutions concerned by the six cross-border conurbations involved in the project. 
3.7 Durability of the project results 
The durability of the project results may be analysed at two levels: - At local level: cross-border cooperation requires a long-haul process. The objective of the EGTC URBACT project is to develop cross-border strategies on governance but one has to keep in mind that their implementation might take some time according to local, regional, national and European contexts. The involvement of elected representatives is, for this reason, crucial. The result of the EGTC URBACT project at cross-border level may correspond either at the enhancement of the governance system or at the establishment of a new governance tool. A good governance system, when operational, could, in fine, enable cross-border conurbations to take advantage of all human, natural, economic, social, financial, resources in order to respond to local needs. But such a governance system can only have a long-term settlement insofar as the results of its action are concrete, with the development and implementation of a territorial strategy for the cross-border territory and concrete projects, and visible for the citizens and the Medias. - At European level: being a network and a platform of exchange between all stakeholders concerned by cross-border cooperation at European and national levels, MOT will intend to insure the durability and the capitalisation of the results of the projects. For instance, consistently with its missions of promoting cross-border cooperation and multi-level dialogue, the URBACT European Support Group could be pursued after the end of the project. Besides, the MOT will integrate the EGTC URBACT project’s results in its own strategy at national level, and European level with EUROMOT. That will be the subject of its Local Action Plan. 
3.8 Budget The total amount for the whole project is 299 557 € (for the development and implementation phases).  
SYNTHESIS 
INTRODUCTION 
Spatial organisation is a changing reality influenced by many factors. The main reason for geographical restructuring in today’s Europe is economic globalisation. It offers opportunities but it is also a source of threats for local areas. The ability of local decision-makers to grasp the challenges of economic globalisation and to adopt policies securing spatial assets in a competitive environment is essential for the future of territories. It is also important to keep in mind that economic development is based on networks of urban nodes, each pole trying to stabilise or to improve its positioning in the network to get a stronger influence in it. As Manuel Castells says, the importance of each node is linked to its ability to contribute to the network’s goals. At the same time, the complexity of development in a free-market environment has led to a down-scaling of strategic planning. Local areas are becoming the most important level to define efficient policies. That trend has implied the establishment of territorial communities regrouping multi-scale, public/private decision makers. Governance has become a necessary organisation because of the inability of a single government to defend the interest of a territory. The sharing of sovereignty which has been taking place during the past decades in most European countries between EU institutions, Nation States and local authorities to the benefit of locally-based agenda is one of the two most visible evolutions of territorial management. The second most important change in the definition and implementation of development is the participation of non-elected bodies such as privates businesses and the citizens themselves. The white paper on European Governance adopted by the European Commission in 2001 put a lot of emphasis on the participatory agenda. The same trend exists in most EU countries. Economic globalisation and international competition can destabilise traditional spatially-based communities hence the necessity to renew a sense of belonging and to regenerate democratic processes through innovative consultations of citizens. The success of territorial cohesion policies implies a strengthening of democracy and solidarity. Urban conurbations located in cross-border areas are more concerned than others by the opportunities and threats of globalisation as they are potentially more crossed by international flows than their counterpart internally situated. The flows of goods and people tends to create cross-border urban groupings which are not necessarily functioning well as spatial management is put into the hand of nationally-based authorities. Territorial cohesion in cross-border conurbation requires innovative governance methods to overcome the problems linked to the overlapping of national competences. The first level of cross-border governance implies the co-ordination of public authority’s policies. The second one is the implementation of cross-border strategies through a co-decision process. It means the progressive establishment of a European public sphere including an involvement of the civil society. The European Grouping of Territorial Co-operation (EGTC) is a governance tool enabling the definition of strategies and the implementation of an action plan. However it will be of the responsibility of each territory to define the contents of the cross-border governance. The EGTC URBACT Project (on governance), whose objective is to contribute to efficient cross-border governance, links territories facing common challenges in spite of different regional and national environments. The current governance system in each of them is anchored in a recent history and the existing organisation can have led to some strategies and concrete results. At the same time, most of them are to enter in a new governance framework. Consequently the cross-border conurbations’ network created by the EGTC URBACT Project can become an information and exchange platform stimulating innovative methods in terms of cross-border urban partnership. The activities and the outputs developed in the framework of the EGTC URBACT project are complementary to previous initiatives undertaken by networks of border local authorities such as MOT. The increasing role of this structure, original by its nature (association and interministerial), its positioning in the institutional environment (as a relay on cross-border cooperation between local, national and European institutions) and its missions (operational assistance for structuring cross-border territory projects, help for the definition of national and European strategies, training, information and communication), has demonstrated the need for local stakeholders to benefit from an external support for structuring their projects and strategies. The specific architecture of URBACT projects and especially of the EGTC URBACT project - a network of cities, a Lead Expert, a Lead Partner having a strong expertise in the field of governance of cross-border conurbations – might be highly valuable for the involved cross-border conurbations. 
1 DIFFERENT TERRITORIAL ENVIRONMENTS BUT A COMMON FUNCTIONAL INTEGRATION 
1.1 Different categories of areas 
The six territories involved in the EGTC URBACT project can be classified in different spatial groups. In one way or another, they are all sharing similarities. For instance, in terms of size, the Eurometropole Lille-Kortrijk-Tournai, the Eurodistrict Strasbourg-Ortenau and the Trinational Eurodistrict of Basel (“TEB”) belong to the same group of large European metropolitan areas with a population ranking between 650.000 and 2.000.000 inhabitants. They are urban poles concentrating high services and competing in the world-wide grid of capital cities. The other 3 conurbations (the Frankfurt (0)/Slubice conurbation, the Eurocidade Chaves-Verin and the Ister-Granum Euroregion1) are medium-sized ones concentrating between 40.000 and 90.000 inhabitants. They can have assets helping them to position themselves at the European level. For instance, the Ister-Granum conurbation has a strategic car factory for the whole of Europe and employs directly and indirectly 30.000 people in Hungary. In terms of regional environment, the three large metropolitan areas are located in the central part of Europe concentrating wealth and population. On the contrary, the 3 other areas have a peripheral situation in regional environment facing often a population decrease and an economic restructuring. Still, the global regional differences can hide different realities at the local scale. For instance the Eurometropole Lille-Kortrijk-Tournai has had to face an economic restructuration during the past 30 years due to the decline of traditional industrial units and some efforts are still developed locally to overcome problems inherited from the past such as in the conurbation of Frankfurt (O)/Slubice. At the same time, the more peripheral Ister-Granum Euroregion has received massive investments of external businesses leading to an economic boost and a shortage of some competences. History also connects the territories. The current process of cross-border conurbation is anchored in a long term and often chaotic history. For instance, Frankfurt (O)/Slubice, Strasbourg-Ortenau, Ister-Granum Euroregion and the French-German parts of the Trinational Eurodistrict of Basel were located in the same state less than a century ago. The two national parts of the Eurometropole Lille-Kortrijk-Tournai and of the Eurocidade Chaves- Verin have shared a common interlinked economy over time. 
1.2 A functional integration due to EU public commitments and private strategies. 
The end of communism in Eastern Europe, the progressive integration of countries in the EU and the long-term political integration at the communautary scale (Single European Market, Introduction of the Euro, Schengen agreement) meant an intensification of flows in the six conurbations of the URBACT project. The flows were also made possible because of the building-up of bridges and motorways very often financed with the support of the European Union. The most emblematic of these investments in terms of size is probably the crossborder airport located in the TEB2. Some other ones have also a strong functional and symbolic signification such as for instance the Maria Valeria bridge in the Ister-Granum Euroregion, destroyed during the second world war and rebuilt more than 50 years later. The most significant aspect of this functional integration is job-related. Data are not available in all territories to have a complete overview of cross-border workers and when data exist, the flows vary from one area to the next. However it is common phenomenon everywhere. People cross borders to get better job opportunities. It can have been illegal for some time in specific areas such as the conurbations located between Poland and Germany but it is a strong characteristic shared by the six areas. For instance, Spanish doctors and nurses cross the border every day to work in Portuguese hospitals in the Eurocity of Chaves-Verin, thousands of Slovak workers of the Sturovo region are employed in the Hungarian factories of Esztergom in the Ister-Granum Euroregion. It is also the case of thousands of French workers living in Strasbourg and crossing the Rhine River daily to be employed in German businesses. The cumulated flows of cross-border workers in the Eurometropole Lille-Kortrijk- Tournai and in the TEB are respectively of 17.400 and 58.000 people. Retailing is also an activity leading to cross-border flows of people. People migrate easily to the other side of the urban area to get cheaper petrol and goods and even housing. The search for a larger choice of items or simply the desire to access specific services or culturerelated artefacts can also be responsible for these migrations. However, public legal commitments at the EU scale and the financing of public infrastructures is not enough to organise a sustainable development at the cross-border conurbation scale. The European policies have enabled to liberate some flows only. A public policy is still needed in favour of territorial cohesion as public space is not yet planned at a cross-border level. 
2 CROSS-BORDER TERRITORIAL COHESION POLICIES. 
2.1 History of the cross-border co-operation 
The history of modern cross-border co-operation at a regional/local level is relatively recent in the territories involved in the EGTC URBACT Project. Most of the local cross-border collaborations have started in the 1990’s. For the Eastern European cross-border conurbations, the collapse of communist regims has enabled to reconnect border regions (Germany-Poland, Hungary-Slovakia). More generally, cross-border conurbations became a progressive reality when their National States entered the European Union. The functional integration of cross-border areas due to the European Single Market, the Schengen Agreements and the Single Currency has been instrumental in the establishment of new public transnational links at a local level. The Interreg programmes were also a major tool inciting connections. They were used firstly to test bilateral relationships on single thematic objective. Progressively, the number of cross-border projects uniting different public organisations has increased. Consequently, the projects have been responsible for the creation of a web of local authorities. That grid has been often the substratum of the current political agenda and governance in favour of territorial cohesion. In parallel to thematic projects, a few territories have initiated some strategic planning frameworks. An institutional platform was created between the municipalities’ partnership of Lille and the nearby Belgian local authorities to promote cross-border spatial strategies for the metropolitan area (the COPIT in 1991, which was transformed into an association under French law in 2001). The same spatial planning agenda became also a central issue (without any common association) in the Frankfurt (O)-Slubice area in 1994 and in the Basel region in 1995. It took a few more years for the third cross-border metropolitan zone of the URBACT Project (the Strasbourg-Ortenau one), to enter the same strategic planning process beginning in 1999. 
2.2 Cross-border governance tools and commitments. 
The European Grouping of Territorial Co-operation (EGTC), which supplements the already existing “legal tool box” available for cross-border cooperation, appears as a potential governance tool by all partners of the EGTC URBACT Project. It differs from the other instruments because it is available to all twenty-seven member states of the European Union and it is open to a very broad partnership, including State level. Some of the partners are more advanced than others in the creation of an EGTC. The Eurometropole Lille-Kortrijk-Tournai is the only one to have an official EGTC. Its organisation should become operational in the near future with the recruitment of its director. The Ister- Granum Euroregion has also put in place an EGTC but it must still be recognized by the Hungarian Government. The 2 EGTC have a different executive organisation. The French- Belgian one is a power-sharing system associating all public authorities (local, provincial, departmental, community-related, regional and national ones) whereas the Slovak- Hungarian project is centred around local authorities only. Connections with authorities located at a larger scale will be organised through thematic projects and external collaboration. The Eurocidade Chaves-Verin is also engaged in the creation of an EGTC through a global project put into an Interreg application form. Elsewhere, apart from the Trinational Eurodistrict of Basel (TEB) which has a registered association since 2002, the cross-border conurbations have no legal structure. Governance is based on local politicians’ commitments. The engagements can be officialised by a convention such as for instance in the Eurodistrict Strasbourg-Ortenau since 2005, a convention describing in details the cross-border partnership and the structures involved. When the process is more flexible, there is always an inner circle of local authorities connected with upper-level decision-making authorities through various projects. The political will to structure cross-border conurbation is expressed in 3 different ways. First of all, there is a commitment in terms of time and networking at political and technical levels from both sides of the border. Meetings between politicians take place at least every month to discuss about strategic decisions and common agenda. When formal commitments exist (structure/convention), meetings take place at least twice a year or annually. Technicians meet one another on a more regular basis (weekly/fortnightly). At the moment, apart from the Trinational Eurodistrict of Basel, no conurbation has technicians employed by a cross-border structure. It should soon be the case for the 3 EGTC projects mentioned previously. When there is no structure, it is the most powerful local authorities on both sides of the cross-border area which employ the staff dedicated to cross-border co-operation (e.g.: The Ortenau Kreis and the Municipalities partnership of Strasbourg in the Eurodistrict Strasbourg-Ortenau – The 2 Sub-regional development agencies located in the Ister- Granum Euroregion). The co-ordination of the co-operation is financed above all by local authorities. No Interreg funding has been asked for the cross-border management. European money has only been used for projects. It is also important to keep in mind that internal governance can be interlinked with other cross-border initiatives in favour of territorial cohesion. We can distinguish 2 different types of governance tools in which the conurbations are more or less involved. The first type is regionally-based urban network: the “City Twin” network regrouping 14 twinned cities located in border regions of Poland, Germany, Estonia, Finland, Sweden, Lithuania, Russia and the Czech Republic) and the “Eixo Atlantico” network regrouping 34 cities and medium-sized towns located in Galicia and Northern Portugal. The objectives of these urban networks are to stimulate cross-border collaboration, good practices exchanges between its members and also to create a communication platform at the European scale. The 2 cities of Frankfurt (O)/Slubice are taking part into the “City Twin” network and the cities of Chaves-Verin are members of Eixo Atlantico association. In parallel with these networks, there can be Euroregions whose role is to build-up an interregional strategic policy. The Eurodistrict Strasbourg-Ortenau and the TEB are associated to the work of the Upper-Rhine Region and its Conference. They can for instance be involved as spatial laboratories of Euroregion innovative planning strategies. The same Euroregion structure exists between Galicia and Northern Portugal with the “Working Community of Galicia-Norte de Portugal”. The cities of Chaves and Verin are working members of that community through the specific territorial commission dedicated to their common Valley of Tamega. The same Euroregion structure exists between Galicia and Northern Portugal with the ""Working Community of Galicia-Norte de Portugal"". This working community, is a member of the working group created for the project Eurocidade Chaves-Verin, two cross border municipalities in the Tamega Valley . At the EU level, there can also be a link between these conurbations and other information platforms, in the framework of the Association of European Border Regions and Mission Opérationnelle Transfrontalière (MOT) or EUROMOT. Secondly, the political consciousness is expressed through the drafting of a common crossborder strategy. Some territorial strategies have been defined since the mid-1990’s (Eurometropole of Lille and the nearby Belgian local authorities, Frankfurt (O)-Slubice area, Basel region and Strasbourg-Ortenau). National initiatives can have been taken in favour of cross-border strategic planning. For instance, in 2005, the French national planning agency, the DIACT, has encouraged large conurbations to built-up a metropolitan strategy. In border regions, that metropolitan agenda has involved local authorities located on the other side of the frontier. Lille Metropolitan Area and the Strasbourg-Ortenau conurbation have defined a cross-border metropolitan project. The entry into the 2007-2013 Structural Funds period also meant a lot of co-operation locally to get a global strategic policy for the whole territory (e.g.: the Eurocidade Chaves-Verin and the Ister-Granum Euroregion). Finally, in parallel with the writing of a strategy, a symbolic decision has been taken in favour of cross-border conurbations. A name has been generally given to the cross-border conurbations. Apart from the Frankfurt (O)-Slubice one, the other cross-border areas were given names carrying a symbolic European meaning: one Euroregion (Ister-Granum), one Eurometropole (Lille-Kortrijk-Tournai) two Eurodistricts (Strasbourg-Ortenau, TEB) and one Eurocity (Chaves-Verin).
 2.3 Objectives of cross-border co-operations 
2.3.1 Structural projects and culture-related actions In terms of cross-border projects, structural and lighter actions have been put forwards. Achievements have been real ones. The structural results are mainly connected to transportation and environment. A lot of the URBACT Project Partners have a project in common: the building or rebuilding of bridges as a first physical and symbolic link when a river divided nationally the conurbation (Danube, Rhine, Neisse). Secondly, logistics have also been a sector connecting both sides of the border for instance in the Chaves area. Finally, cross-border water treatment plants have been made in the Eurométropole Lille- Kortrijk-Tournai. However these concrete actions haven’t been necessarily carried out by the local authorities coordinating the cross-border conurbation. Furthermore, they can have been put in place to resolve a local problem, to exploit a common asset or to work on the symbolic side of cooperation but not in a global territorial cohesion policy. They were the first steps of collaboration showing the ability to reach some results. Lighter projects have also been put in place in the conurbations. They are mainly linked to tourism, communication, culture and education/languages. The publishing of a common cultural agenda is carried out in some areas (Eurocidade Chaves-Verin – Euroregion Ister- Granum). The promotion of the neighbour’s language targeting especially youngsters is also stimulated through the financial support of pupils mobility (Eurodistrict Strasbourg-Ortenau), the opening of bilingual class (e.g.: the “euro kita” bilingual kindergarten in Frankfurt (O)- Slubice) ,the printing of pedagogical materials in both languages (Eurodistrict Strasbourg- Ortenau) and the development of entirely bilingual cross-border TV programmes (Eurometropole Lille-Kortrijk-Tournai). In terms of tourism, cross-border maps and touristic routes linked to common cultural heritage have also been promoted (Eurocidade Chaves- Verin – Euroregion Ister-Granum). Some events are also organised for the local crossborder populations. 2.3.2 The strategies The recent strategies developed in the cross-border conurbations of the URBACT project have many points in common: The central role of culture and citizenship to succeed territorial cohesion The construction of a cross-border territory has a strong cultural meaning. It requires a balance of identities and languages. In most of the cross-border conurbation, there are cultural differences which need to be treated carefully, especially when there is a minority issue. The most symbolic example is in the Ister-Granum Euroregion. Both sides of the Danube are above all inhabited by Hungarian native speakers and on the Hungarian part of the Euroregion live a Slovak minority who has kept its language and culture during the past 3 centuries. The Slovak culture is a minority one on both national sides of the Ister-Granum Euroregion and the Hungarian populations living in Slovakia is a minority at a Slovak regional scale. The choice of Latin to name the cross-border territory is an expression of local politicians to prevent any misunderstanding concerning the balance of identities for external actors in both countries. The same minority issue goes for French and Flemish minorities. In the Trinational Eurodistrict of Basel, only 8% of the population is French-speaking but all the communication is in German and French. The exclusive use of German in France and especially in Alsace would be difficult to imagine. In the Eurometropole Lille-Kortrijk-Tournai, Dutch is a minority language as French in Belgium and the inhabitants of Lille in France are French native speakers. Even if French can be the lingua franca of the cross-border collaboration, the use of Dutch is considered important for the Flanders partners of the cooperation, not only for the written communication but also for the spoken one in some technical groups. It shows the sensitivity of cultural identities in today’s Europe. The same goes at the border between Poland and Germany even if German is lingua franca of the cross-border co-operation. In the case of the Eurocidade Chaves-Verin, the situation is more similar to the Ister-Granum Euroregion. Locally, the cultural sensitivity issue is not a central one. Portuguese and Galician people can understand one another by speaking in their own language and the past century was a relatively peaceful period in terms of cross-border relationships. However, at a National scale, in Spain, the Galician culture is a minority one like the Basque and the Catalan ones. This minority situation at a National scale can have an impact on the use of Spanish locally. For instance, in terms of education, in the Eurocity, is it more appropriate to promote bilingual connections Portuguese-Spanish to help Portuguese pupils to learn the second most spoken language in the world or bilingual relations Portuguese-Galician to increase the cultural connections between both regions? The notions of culture and citizenship are interlinked. The association of the local population to the cross-border process is fostered. It was the case in the drafting of many cross-border strategies. The participatory agenda is most of time mentioned, mainly through representatives of the local interest groups and through actions targeting the local population. It is a way to regenerate local democracy and to work on Eurocitizenship. Public services response to the needs of the whole cross-border population The Eurocitizenship will become a reality when a European public sphere is organised locally. The public sphere implies a public opinion and public opinion at a cross-border scale can exist partly if there is a common access and use of public services, a sense of solidarity. The most challenging objective in terms of structural projects is related of course to common investments but also the common use of public services. It requires the progressive reduction of national legal barriers limiting that cross-border access. On that side of the cooperation, few results can be displayed up-to-now. In the Eurodistrict Strasbourg-Ortenau, some special agreements have been reached in terms of cross-border emergency services and vocational training. Some other examples show the necessity to create proximity logics. For instance, in the Ister-Granum Euroregion, the citizens of Sturovo in Slovaquia must travel 50 km to reach the first major hospital inland whereas the Hungarian hospital of Esztergom is 5 minutes away from the Slovak city. In case of urgent treatment or maternity needs, the Slovak patients’ life can be at risk. The same goes for education and all the other services aiming at the local population. For instance, the Portuguese City of Chaves has a new Art school which could be used by the local Spanish pupils of Verin who must travel long distances to have access inland to the same facilities. The building-up of some futures education equipments are only thinkable if the catchment areas are cross-border ones. Another example is the under-construction co-operation for a cross-border public cremation service in the Eurometropole Lille-Kortrijk-Tournai. Sustainability and territorial marketing agenda Cross-border flows of goods and people imply an intensification of traffic. Roads in the border regions can be congested and public transport services as a main tool of a sustainable mobility are not automatically planned at a cross-border scale hence the necessity to promote cross-border public transport policies. At the same time, a cross-border management of natural resources is a central point because pollution doesn’t stop at national borders and a common used/preservation of the natural assets can be a source of development. Moreover, environmental and climate policies usually cover larger regions or natural basins beyond the cross border conurbation area (e.g.: the thermal strategy of the Eurocidade Chaves-Verin; the sustainable energetic policy mentioned in the Metropolitan strategy of the Eurodistrict Strasbourg-Ortenau). Urban competition in a globalised environment also requires the development of territorial marketing policies at a critical size. Consequently, cross-border conurbations need to develop an image and an external communication platform in order to be more visible and European at the international level. 
2.4 A required evolution in terms of cross-border governance: an overview of local action plans and local support groups 
The development and the implementation of the three broad strategic objectives previously mentioned implies a change in terms of partnership, hence the interest of all the territories to participate into the URBACT Project to exchange ideas concerning their local action plans related to governance. The content of these local action plans can be divided in two parts: the internal governance tools and policies and the external connections with multi-level private/public partners In terms of internal strategies, we can distinguish three main objectives. The first one is the improvement of existing governance models such as for instance in the Trinational Eurodistrict of Basel which would like to develop a more efficient metropolitan governance. The second one is the selection of new governance methods/structures adapted to the local decision-makers needs (e.g.: the Frankfurt (O)/Slubice conurbation, Eurodistrict Strasbourg- Ortenau). The third one is the definition of an operational management (technical/political) within the framework of a newly/shortly registered cross-border organisation and more precisely within the EGTC (e.g.: Eurometropole Lille-Kortrijk-Tournai, the Eurocidade Chaves-Verin and the Ister-Granum Euroregion). The three objectives are strongly interlinked. The objectives related to interactions with external networks are mainly the same for all the cross-border conurbations. Firstly, it consists in deepening or adapting the relationships with the decision-makers located at an upper-scale and not participating directly to the local governance system. Secondly, the aim is to keep in mind the necessary link with the local population and interest groups living the cross-border conurbation. Participative methods have been tested. They must be improved, developed, adapted to the new environment of cross-border co-operation, that is to say the implementation of structural policies integrating border regions. In parallel with the participatory agenda, the question of communication will be a central one in the local action plans. Efficient governance strategies will be based on a clear definition of communication, target groups and visibility/interactive tools. The construction of these local action plans will be made possible because of the building-up of local communities associating experts, multi-level decision-makers and legitimate civil society representatives from either side of borders. The URBACT Local Support Groups (ULSG) will associate a part of these local communities because the inclusion of all territorial networks into the ULSG would make them difficult to manage. Four cross-border conurbations have put in place an ULSG involving mainly public authorities (Eurometropole Lille-Kortrijk-Tournai, Eurocicade Chaves-Verin, Trinational Eurodistrict of Basel, Eurodistrict Strasbourg-Ortenau). The two other ones have decided to create local group associating public authorities, some experts and civil society representatives (the Frankfurt (O)/Slubice conurbation, Ister-Granum Euroregion). MOT, as a network, will not set up a URBACT Local Support Group involved in the development of a Local Action Plan. In order to bring local needs expressed in recommendations up to the European level so as to input the evolution of the contextual European framework, the MOT will organise a URBACT European Support Group (UESG). The recent creation of the EGTC tool by European Institutions with the consent of National States will not resolve all the legal/political/technical problems linked to cross-border spatial cohesion. There is a necessity to determine, at the EU level, recommendations stimulating an adaptation of public policies in favour of cross-border governance. The recommendations will make sense only if they are based on a legitimate network of National and EU competencies. The UESG will associate European Union representatives and National/Regional law-making institutions concerned by the six cross-border conurbations involved in the project.

 ENTER.HUB  European Network exploiting Territorial Effects of Railway Hubs and their Urban Benefits. 
 
 The project intends to create a network of medium sized cities sharing the opportunities and challenges derived from the presence of existing or planned transportation hub of regional relevance, (i.e. high speed stations or major transport interfaces).  The network aims to support cities in re-defining their territorial, infrastructural and transport systems, planning functions and activities to satisfy the territorial needs and strengthen new linkages with different EU regions, as a base of competiveness and innovation transfer.  Main issues to be addressed:  How a medium sized city can become competitive in the framework of EU cities and in this context of economic crisis?  How to exploit the benefits brought by the presence of an inter-modal HUB / interface, being at the same time a tool and engine for a sustainable urban and territorial development of the surrounding areas, at local, regional and EU level? 
  ENTER.HUB ASSUMPTIONS:  
1. ENTER.HUB focuses especially in PERIPHERAL CITIES/REALITIES, partly isolated from major international circuits of exchange. This because: 1. Of medium size and 2. Usually located between two large centres. We could advance that it makes more sense for Europe to invest in medium-sized cities, especially the most disadvantaged in terms of visibility, because this helps to rebalance and redistribute future investments: development of the peripheral cities – development of polycentrism.  2. CITIES are the CORE of the ECONOMIC and RELATIONAL DEVELOPMENT of a territory (Lisbon Agenda) 3. KEY FACTORS described by the Lisbon Agenda as indicators of city attractiveness are transport connections, metropolitan transport, ICT infrastructure, environment, social fabric and culture. Thorough analysis and integrated propositions of these 5 fields is necessary to make them become the pillars of new innovative planning strategies, especially for middle-sized cities which aim to become ATTRACTIVE AND SMART CITIES.  4. ACCESSIBILITY, among other factors, determines the COMPETITIVENESS of a city and a territory.  5. TRANSPORT is a major component of public service (Transport White Paper and Treaty of Rome).  6. European network hubs have a strategic role in the regeneration of a city and a territory because of the direct INTERRELATIONSHIP between good ACCESSIBILITY to a city and its REGENERATION.  7. in order to overcome the economic crisis, cities have to promote and better exploit the RELATIONAL NETWORKS AMONG PEOPLE, their sense of pride and belonging to their local/regional (and even EU) community and capitalize on the human resources  8. High Speed (HS) and European corridors are the BACKBONE of Europe not only at an infrastructural level, but as a consequence influencing the level of interactions and economic and cultural development (according to the revised TEN-T policy).  9. RAILWAY LINES, especially in the form of HSL, are at DIFFERENT LEVELS OF DEVELOPMENT across Europe. In the next few years they are bound to overtake air transport and to become the most important and environmental sustainable transport system, especially for the medium distances. This is in line with the EU communication “Keep Europe Moving, the “Connecting Europe Facility” and the Transport White Paper especially approach C and measures proposed, because railway development improves the accessibility through a sustainable and alternative mode to road and air mobility, able to reduce congestion and pollution.  10. It is NOT ONLY CITIES with their railway junctions/transport interchanges that need to be exploited, but also the AREAS that SURROUND these hubs, that means, other cities in the area. The effects will then, albeit in a different way, be multiplied found over the whole catchment area.  11. This urban CONFIGURATION (medium city and its surroundings, not only single city) will be INCREASINGLY PRESENT in the European context (as groups of cities will be served by these hubs). 

SYNERGY WITH THE CITY the railway interface has a strategic role in the redefinition of a city asset. The investigation will concern the new economic, cultural, social dynamics established (e. g. housing demand, market, tourism and cultural activities renewal, social effects, …) 
SYNERGY WITH THE HINTERLAND (catchment area): the territorial effects of these hubs can even be perceived at a wider level. The focus will be on how an intermodal junction spread its influence in the territory gravitating on it.
 TOURISM AND CULTURE the insertion of a o node of regional significance or a HS station can also be accelerator of tourism regeneration at a local and regional level. In turn tourism can act as a throttle to urban and territorial regeneration. 
 URBAN AND ENVIRONMENTAL INSERTION of the junction and infrastructure at the service of the node in order, at the same time, to harmonize the infrastructures with the territory, and to reduce their impact and to help users in reaching the station or, from the station, their destination (and this with special care when the destination is the historical city centre), following the European Landscape Convention outlines. 
 COMMUNICATION/ PARTICIPATION/ GOVERNANCE make users and local stakeholders/ actors aware that the interface will serve the entire catchment area and as such can be a driving force for certain economic activities, especially in the tertiary field (to install new or revitalize existing ones). To conceptualize a graphic model/restitution of the catchment area. 
 CREATION OF NETWORKS between these hubs and their polycentric regions (networks of accessibility, economic, social, cultural nature). The investigation will concern the definition of tools and strategies for developing such a network. 
 NEW PLANNING TOOLS AND TOOLKITS that are based on the new non-political boundaries of the catchment area. It will be important to define the reference catchment area for supra-city area, involving therefore also nearby cities which become part of the catchment area, and have the appropriate planning tools for the area; new proceedings and negotiation tools will be needed to foster voluntary cooperation.
 RAILWAY-RAILWAY NETWORKING as intermodal junctions, these hubs have to strengthen their capacity of connecting different rail networks in order to make them able to feed each other and to satisfy the demand of transport service of the whole territory.
 RAILWAY-ROAD NETWORKING: the need to optimize (instead of the extend) road infrastructures in order to make them able to serve an intermodal hub need a specific investigation, in particular for networking the highway and the railway (both the main and the local lines) systems. 
 ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES to be installed or renewed thanks to the node and nearby: the junction can have a multiplier effect and be a ""speaker"" of innovative thrust of a whole region. It would be important to identify the indicators that companies prefer, to localize in a particular area and prepare the creation of a ""unified package” (“one-stop-window”) of procedures, documentation and permit remise (a kind of conference of services for private entities, so as to streamline the course of procedures that a company had to afford to install).


ENTER.HUB AIMS: 
 to DEVELOP A WELL BALANCED POLYCENTRIC SYSTEM: to make these medium cities attractive and competitive; to address the existing hierarchies among the cities and the preferential connections before and after the arrival of a intermodal hub, the TEN-T corridors and HSL; to carry an equal re-distribution of the urban weights and a re-definition of the urban centre systems; to maintain an equilibrium of the urban and rural contexts by working on their peculiar identity, strengthening effective connections but avoiding shrinking or dispersion phenomena. to INTERVENE AT DIFFERENT LOCAL LEVELS (starting form cities, because they are “engines” of the territorial development):   a-- the LOCAL level of the station area and of the city itself (i.e. relations with the historical city centre; measures for avoiding the urbanized areas dispersion, especially in the cases of decentralized stations). For example, in-depth studies at EU level have highlighted that the arrival of a HSL, livening up the internal dynamics and bringing an image of a really European and “open-minded” city, can give a great development push to the city and to all the spheres of the economy  b-- the REGIONAL level of the territories gravitating on each of these new railway hubs: how making the station accessible and regenerating for the whole catchment area; how spreading the HS and railway EU corridors effects on the whole influence area.  c-- the EUROPEAN level of all the EU territories connected by these preferential channels, to be perceived as infrastructural and relation channels: how to foster these relationships in order to create a new EU exchange network for the sharing of economical-social-cultural flows able to face the crisis. This will revitalise the rail transport on the medium/long distances too (it has been pointed out that for distances up to 600 km the HS train is competitive with the plane).  to make cities able to reach the difficult BALANCE among some variables like GROWTH, EQUITY, ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY, LOCAL IDENTITY, in order to face the current economical crisis;  to bring COHESION AND VALORISATION on the internal RESOURCES-identities-heritages, being them at the basis of the economical and social development : protection from the homologation risks; protection of the differences of the EU territories; keeping of the capacity of producing growing parts of territorial added value; establishment of a high quality in the fields of urban design, architecture and environment. to promote the EQUITABLE CONDITIONS OF ACCESSIBILITY in terms of infrastructures for the whole European territory (not only in terms of extension but even of density).  Based on these assumptions and aims ENTER.HUB proposed for the development phase 10 themes were proposed for cities to choose from and the initial 5 cities made indicated preliminary preferences.  Macro themes (aggregation of the initial10 themes) ENTER.HUB promotes the role of railway hubs/multimodal interfaces in medium cities as engines for integrated urban development and regeneration. The network of local actors will redefine the territorial and functional systems around these hubs, by exploiting these “agglomerates of flows” to strengthen connectivity at a local/regional/EU level for cities to become more competitive, to attract population and business in the face of the economic crisis.  The project will be developed through the shaping of a framework composed by: “Territorial and urban actions”: 4 project macrothemes grouping the 9 project themes. “Strategic and transversal policies”: 5 transversal themes.  This composition was firstly established by a study of the state of the art at a European level, and then refined through the comparison of the knowledge/condition/needs of each partner, collected especially during the study visits. The difference between these 2 groups is basically: the Territorial and urban actions (themes and macrothemes) would be topics more linked to the object-hub and its territorial dimension (catchment area), having a territorial identity, being a sort of action on the territory and requiring further actions on the territory itself (projects, plans, interventions, actions etc both in the ""adjacent zone” - like urban plans in the area and close to the hub, and at a wider level, e. g. the connecting (transport) system)  The Strategic and transversal policies (transversal themes) would be more about the approaches, tools, strategies, policies etc. that we could use for developing these actions and as a consequence for exploiting these hubs. Developing these transversal policies could lead to cross-fertilization /mainstream integration with European Structural Funds. Therefore the proposed framework has been drafted as follows, by considering 4 definitions of “hub - railway station”:  1. hub as a node/interface  2. hub as a gateway  3. hub as a centre  4. hub as a turbine  These 4 macrothemes gather and re-organize the 10 themes indicated in the Declaration of Interest and integrate them with some new ones proposed by the partners.  macrothemes are numbered from 1 to 4  themes are numbered with the number relevant to the macrotheme and the alphabetic letter.

 Description of the 5 STRATEGIC AND TRANSVERSAL POLICIES (transversal macro-themes).
 Communication/Governance/Participation: make users and local stakeholders/actors aware that the interface will serve the entire catchment area and as such can be a driving force for certain economic activities, especially in the tertiary field (to install new or revitalize existing ones). To conceptualize a graphic model/representation of the catchment area. 
 New planning and strategic tools: tools based on the new non-political boundaries of the catchment area will be needed by the specific assets given by such hubs insertion. It will be important to define the reference catchment area and to strengthen the coordination among institutions, by involving, for instance, also nearby cities which become part of the catchment area, and have the appropriate planning tools for the area. New proceedings and negotiation tools will be needed to foster voluntary cooperation.
  New technologies / smart cities: how to exploit the new technologies for (1) communication, transmission to the users of the potential of the hubs, in terms of transport connection (real time information) and for (2) data recording and representation (recording by sensors and representation of the phenomena triggered by the hub, i.e. affluence, people moving, users requests, …) useful for the understanding of the hub working and users needs. In addition, how to develop integrated info and ticketing / payment systems by different channels, being the potential of hubs increased if there is a low barrier intermodal exchange (including the cars).
  Economic tools: to investigate activities to be installed or renewed thanks to the node and nearby: the junction can have a multiplier effect and be a “driver of innovative change”) of a whole region. It would be important to identify the indicators that companies prefer, to localize in a particular area and prepare the creation of a “unified package” (“one-stop-window”) of procedures, documentation and permit remise. 
  ENTER.HUB and European Policies to investigate what can be the links between our project and the European policies on these topics, especially on: (1) how ENTER.HUB can give inputs to the new EU policies; (2) how middle sized cities (=our partnership and the general project target) can in their turn, benefit from these policies and from investments foreseen by these policies (a sort of closure of the circle).

HOW TO MANAGE URBAN DEVELOPMENT IN THE CONTEXT OF THE ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL CRISIS: 
TO PUT URBAN DEVELOPMENT AT THE BASIS OF THE ECONOMIC CRISIS CHALLENGE. Urban development is essential in helping cities facing the economic and financial crisis. At the same time, due to decreased public resources, in this moment of crisis it is more and more difficult to carry on measures and concrete actions of urban development. To work at a EU level should help to optimize the resources of each city itself and of each city as a part of a whole and wider system. Urban development should not aim, especially in this critical phase, at large and expensive interventions, but at smaller, smarter, benefitting from these interventions (interventions not only to be intended as “hard” interventions, i.e. public spaces and structures requalification or construction, transport facilities, etc, but even as “soft” interventions, i.e. cultural initiatives, networks of figures interested in the same fields, etc. These two levels of interventions really need a EU exchange to be effective for a smart, sustainable and cohesive growth of cities (and of Europe, as cities are its development engines). This in line with the definition of future EU guidelines fro sustainable and smart development of cities as stated in commission’s documents. 
HOW TO FOSTER INTEGRATED AND SUSTAINABLE APPROACHES TO URBAN DEVELOPMENT. 
TO USE INTEGRATED (INTER-DISCIPLINARY AND MULTI-LEVEL) APPROACHES TO THE URBAN DEVELOPMENT. People who will have a “role” in a well-defined urban context (institutional, scientific, as user, as stakeholder) are those people who have to be involved in the planning and decision phases. A multi-level and multi-disciplinary (or, if we can say it, inter-level and inter-disciplinary) approach, where not only knowledge/skills/fields/levels competence, but even needs and expectations, worries and challenges are integrated, permits to provide” urban answers” shaped following everyone’s measures, and needs smart, sustainable and cohesive approaches (even because shared approaches) for smart, sustainable and cohesive growth, for smart, sustainable and cohesive cities and territories. URBACT resources will allow the city partners to create new meaningful connections and dialogue between city stakeholders to make the most and best of their railway hubs. The initial phase will include a stakeholder’s identification and analysis- shared across cities- so that they get new ideas from each other-, to bring together in an innovative way all those who can input and benefit from the station developments.
HOW TO DEVELOP EFFICIENT PARTNERSHIPS AND MULTI-LEVEL GOVERNANCE PROCESSES. 
MULTI-LEVEL GOVERNANCE FOR MULTI-SCALAR PHENOMENA. Multi-level governance, able to link different levels of authorities, each one with its own competences and fields of investigation and intervention, is an essential tool for analyzing and facing some “multi-scalar” phenomena (i.e. phenomena which need to be considered at different scales because at each scale they have different manifestations and different answers to be found). For ENTER.HUB a multi-level governance would be able to individuate each hub catchment area and to intervene on it, with innovative and proper tools, being cross-wide tools to all the municipalities belonging to the catchment area itself.";"22.txt";"22"
"ESIMeC  
Introduction. 
1.1. ESIMeC. 
ESIMeC (Economic Strategies and Innovation in MEdium sized Cities) aims to create a network of medium sized cities which will develop innovative economic strategies to help these and similar cities cope better with the challenges of sustainable economic development, particularly in an economic downturn. Based on the particularities, assets and needs of the partners, the network will explore more closely the role of medium sized cities in post crisis economic growth. It will focus on long term sustainability rather than short term solutions. This is potentially a vast subject area and in order to establish a clear focus the network will concentrate upon demand led workforce development strategies as an instrument of sustainable economic recovery in medium sized cities. “Workforce development” is a term used to describe activities which increase the capacity of individuals to participate in, and contribute effectively to, employment, either through training or other forms of public assistance. ESIMeC will explore how best to identify and meet the needs of employers in this field – thereby ensuring that both the demand and supply needs of the labour market are addressed. It will explore the long term role of medium sized cities in this field and address a series of questions including: Which of the multiple actors in economic development need to be involved in developing and delivering effective demand led skills strategies? How can medium sized cities engage the right people (including industry, government and universities) effectively in this debate? How do we forecast new and constantly evolving employer skills needs in medium sized towns – particularly in new sectors such as green technologies and the knowledge economy? How can a skilled workforce help medium sized cities position themselves to attract and retain high value businesses? How can medium sized cites ensure that workforce development is progressed alongside major flagship economic development (or regeneration) projects in order to derive maximum benefit for citizens? How can medium sized cities help their businesses and citizens understand and value the potential of higher education and skills? Would including workforce development advice in business support services offered by cities help them to meet the skills needs of employers? How can medium sized cities fund workforce development in a context of contracting public sector budgets? Each partner city will establish a Local Support Group which will create a Local Action Plan identifying key medium term priorities, projects and potential funding. The partners will use the learning generated through transnational activities to inform their local actions. They will also create a set of key principles for local leadership looking specifically at sustainable economic growth in medium sized cities – to which all cities would sign up – to ensure that findings are transferred outside the network. The map below shows the location of the ESIMeC Partners. Four of these are from European Convergence Regions meaning that they have higher allocations of European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) to help them address lower than average GDP per capita. Five are from Competitiveness Regions meaning that they have access to some ERDF to help them promote sustainable economic growth. The final ESIMeC partnership is the result of a comprehensive and rigorous partner search exercise which took place during December 2009 and March 2010. The initial five partners agreed a set of key criteria for new partners and a partner search questionnaire was sent to approximately thirty interested cities seeking initial information about the city and about their response to the crisis. Twenty completed questionnaires were returned and a series of telephone interviews followed to probe more deeply into potential partner interest. The selection criteria included city size, employment makeup, convergence / competitiveness issues, geographical spread, amongst others. It was important to develop a balanced partnership of cities facing similar challenges and with potential to jointly develop shared solutions. 
2.5. WHAT CAN ESIMeC CONTRIBUTE? 
ESIMeC has a clear focus on medium sized cities. The desk work undertaken has identified little existing research into the specific challenges and priorities of these cities, except for Eurotowns. Meanwhile there is a great deal of work on how larger cities have responded to the economic downturn and what the key factors for sustainable recovery and growth are. It is clear that a successful recovery strategy should aim for a combination of being able to respond quickly to a crisis and having a long-term strategic approach rather than looking for a cheap, quick win. Perhaps medium sized cities are well placed to have that optimum mix of being responsive, with an ability to put new innovative measures in place quickly, whilst also having sufficient resources and infrastructure to fall back on (i.e. small enough but not too small in most cases). ESIMeC's contribution to this debate could be to explore and define how best to put long term workforce development strategies in place in medium sized cities, which can support a diversified economic base and allow for rapid response if and when another recession arrives. It could aim to answer a series of questions related to the role of medium sized cities in achieving sustainable economic growth. The remaining sections of this report explore the different aspects of economic growth in ESIMEC cities. It also identifies those drivers and barriers which appear particular to medium sized cities. As set out above, the report focuses on the role of demand-led workforce development strategies as an instrument of sustainable economic recovery in medium sized cities. The final section compares some of the findings from the cities and highlights the key themes which ESIMeC could explore further in order to add most value.  
COMPARISONS, CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS  
4.1. INTRODUCTION 
This section of the report takes the information collected through the partner profiles and presents some comparisons between the ESIMeC partner towns in the following areas: Population Unemployment Proportion of companies per size category Skills and the workforce. It lists some of the key drivers and barriers for sustainable economic growth some of which are particular to medium sized cities. It sets out an initial list of areas of common and then summarises the areas of focus for each URBACT local Support GROUP (ULSG) and Local Action Plan. Key competences and learning needs of each partner are summarised in Annex 1 – by partner and then by theme. The report concludes with some recommendations on how best to focus the workplan for the Implementation Phase in order to get best value in the coming 2.5 years. ESIMeC will place workforce development at the heart of its discussions on sustainable economic recovery strategies in medium sized cities. 
4.2. CHARACTERISTICS OF ESIMeC PARTNER CITIES 
ESIMeC partner cities are all medium sized cities where the main impact of the recession has been rising unemployment, particularly amongst young people. They all have a high proportion of micro businesses and cite similar employment sectors – particularly knowledge based businesses - as offering growth potential. Whilst some ESIMeC Cities are home to a university and / or have a high student population, out migration of young (qualified) people is often a problem and without exception ESIMeC partners see workforce development as a key instrument of sustainable post crisis economic growth. 4.2.1 Population The population of ESIMeC partner cities ranges from 82000 in Bistrita to 207645 in Sabadell. ESIMeC is using the European definition of medium sized towns and cities which is from 50000 to 250000. Several partners including Charleroi and Debrecen are considered large cities in their national context, with the latter being Hungary’s second city to its nearby capital. 4.2.2 Unemployment All ESIMeC partner cities have experienced rises in unemployment during the economic downturn. Charleroi has by far the highest unemployment rate at 24%; Basingstoke and Deane has the lowest at 4.9%. Some have been extremely sharp increases e.g. in Bistrita the rate has risen from 2% to 9% in the 12 months to March 2010. Several cities have serious youth unemployment issues – Besançon for example has a rate of between 20% and 25% for 16 to 25 year olds; Cherbourg’s rate for the same age group is 27%. In Charleroi 1 in 5 people seeking work is under 25 years old. Cherbourg also has a higher than average female unemployment rate with 54% of the total unemployed people being women. Almost all the partner cities have high numbers of unqualified or low qualified unemployed people in a saturated job market due principally to the rapid contraction in the construction industry which previously employed low skilled workers. Whilst the majority of partners have an unemployment rate below the national average, Sabadell and Charleroi in particular have local unemployment levels that are higher than the national level – in the case of Charleroi, unemployment is more than double the national average. One of the priorities for ESIMeC will be to explore the role that cities can play in working with employers to find new solutions to help address this common problem. 4.2.4 Breakdown of companies by sector The ESIMeC partners are home to a huge range of employment sectors. All have a reasonably high proportion of public sector workers and in Gävle one in five adults works for the municipality. 4.2.6 Skills and the workforce Not all ESIMeC partners are home to a university. The table below shows those that do have a university, along with the number of students at the university where this data is available. Several towns – and not surprisingly particularly those without a university - are suffering from a “brain drain” with young people going to university outside the town and then either not returning or returning later in life. Both Bistrita and Debrecen have high numbers of young people leaving the town to live in other EU countries. In Debrecen this is a particular frustration as they are home to a high class university and young people often graduate there and then choose to work elsewhere in Europe. The chart below shows the percentage of the population with a higher education (post 18). Albacete has the lowest number of highly educated people with just 16% of the population educated to degree level. Linked in part to the above, the majority of towns also reported a mismatch between the skills and qualifications of the workforce and the skills requirements of existing and potential employers. This is particularly the case in Albacete, Basingstoke and Deane, Bistrita, Cherbourg, Debrecen and Gävle. Without exception ESIMeC partners therefore see demand-led workforce development as a pre requisite of sustainable economic growth. 4.2.7. Impact of and responses to the economic crisis Unemployment and reduction in business numbers are the main features of the crisis in all partner cities. Several cities have a large number of vacant business and residential properties. A reduction in levels of financing for small business and start ups was also cited as an important impact of the recession and one which does not seem to be improving. Construction has been by far the worst hit in terms of employment sectors. The workers previously employed in this sector are often low skilled sole traders without qualifications as they have chosen to work in construction to make money during the boom rather than to continue training and education. Subsequently as the construction sector contracts they enter the ever more competitive labour market, often flooded with highly qualified workers who have also lost their jobs, and struggle to find work. Most partner cities have experienced a reduction in spending power within the local population which has a knock on effect on public sector revenue and often leads to a contraction in public services at the very time they are most in need. The cities which were already experiencing structural decline seem to have been worst hit by the recession. Some partner cities are endeavouring to look at the evolving economic context as an opportunity and in Sabadell, Gävle and Basingstoke in particular the responses aim to take advantage of an opportunity to achieve economic diversification both more quickly and more sustainably. Cluster development, particularly in knowledge economy sectors is underway or planned in several partner cities. E.g. Albacete is keen to take advantage of the Eurocopter factory to develop an aeronautics cluster; Gävle has developed a globally renowned GIS cluster and Sabadell is the regional lead on the Food and associated industry cluster. Urban Tourism and Town Centre urban regeneration projects are in development in more than half of the partner cities as potential contributors to economic recovery. In several cases national measures which were introduced to respond to the crisis have been considered as being too short term in nature. In Spain for example the national employment plan offers short term employment opportunities to low skilled workers in short term public infrastructure projects but the two Spanish ESIMeC partner towns believe this does not fully deal with the structural implications of the crisis. Longer term strategies are needed that target the specific conditions of the workforce in medium sized cities, and which will enable them to be more resilient in future economic downturns. 4.2.8. Economic drivers and barriers in medium sized cities. The baseline study has explored with partners what they consider to be the main economic drivers and barriers to sustainable economic development. It has focused in particular on drivers and barriers which are specific to medium sized cities. The partners agree that these are as follows: DRIVERS Ability to host 21st century businesses and particularly those in the Knowledge Economy where high quality of life and presence of a university are important: medium sized cities often offer a better quality of life than large agglomerations and ESIMeC cities reported lower levels of congestion, better air quality and easier access to nearby countryside and leisure facilities. Good infrastructure (transport and ICT) – medium sized towns often have lower levels of congestion than large metropolitan areas. Several ESIMeC partners are located on transport axes with excellent road, rail, air and maritime transport links. Good positioning vis-à-vis large neighbouring urban conurbations - several ESIMeC cities aim to set themselves apart from large metropolitan areas whilst taking advantage of the benefits offered by proximity. Relatively small size and distances make business relationships easier – partners stated that people are better connected and more likely to know each other in medium sized cities. Ability to act more quickly and be more nimble than larger cities. Availability of good quality land for development: there is often less development in medium sized cities and therefore more land is available for potential investors. BARRIERS Lack of qualified workforce able to meet the demands of current and future employers: medium sized cities do not all have universities or access to good high level training provision. Out migration of (qualified) young people – several ESIMeC partners suffer from large numbers of young people leaving their city to study or work in other cities or countries. Lack of entrepreneurial culture and confidence - it seems to be harder for medium sized cities to instil a dynamic and entrepreneurial culture with a tradition of long term employment rather than self employment. Many ESIMeC cities described this as a barrier to sustainable economic growth post crisis. Lack of experience in public private partnership working – despite the smaller distances and smaller number of stakeholders ESIMeC cities appear to have limited experience of public private partnership. (Perceived) lack of vision and leadership Poor image of the town by outsiders National expenditure programmes appearing to favour large cities in some countries. 4.2.9. Areas of common interest The following long list of themes has emerged as areas of common interest within the ESIMeC partnership: Demand led skills and qualifications strategy and activities to develop and retain skilled workforce Definition and evidence of the role of medium sized towns in economic development Developing an entrepreneurial culture and confidence Industry-Education-Government links and the knowledge economy Provision of relevant high value support to local businesses Public private partnership working Positioning and improving the image of the town Attracting and retaining investors Financing enterprise and entrepreneurship Benchmarking economic development against other medium sized towns Demand led workforce development as a tool for sustainable economic recovery and the specific role of medium sized cities were the most commonly cited areas of interest. Themes of interest to individual partners and not covered above include: Influencing decisions regarding regional and national expenditure for economic development (including Managing Authorities) Supply Chain development to enable small companies to become suppliers to larger companies Managing the transition out of dependency on EU funding Some partners are also interested in others reviewing specific projects in their cities through a peer review process for example. 4.3.5. Conclusions The baseline study has explored the impact of the economic downturn at European, national and local level. It has presented and compared key information on the nine ESIMeC partner cities and concluded that workforce development and skills will be at the heart of transnational exchanges during the project’s Implementation Phase. There is no doubt that ESIMeC partners share a wide range of challenges when faced with developing sustainable economic strategies. Working together will help them to creatively address and answer a wide range of questions relating to the role of medium sized cities in post crisis economic growth. While medium sized cities may face barriers in terms of their lack of entrepreneurial culture, perceived lack of vision and leadership and image compared with larger agglomerations, people are a fundamental resource, which, if skilled and qualified in the industry of the future, has the potential to create a favourable structural framework for sustainable economic development. The project will give partners an opportunity to further explore and define which economic development challenges are specific to medium sized towns and to elaborate common solutions which can then be transferred both within and outside the network. The ambition is also to provide concrete learning opportunities to improve the way things are done at local level. In order to provide a tangible output useful to cities in a similar position across Europe, at the end of the project ESIMeC will agree a set of principles to mirror those set out by the OECD LEED leaders in Barcelona - principles for local leadership looking specifically at sustainable economic growth in medium sized cities – to which all cities would sign up. It would also be useful to open and maintain a dialogue with the OECD LEED Group which may be interested in using the results of ESIMeC to highlight the particularities of medium sized cities. The figure below is a diagrammatic presentation of how ESIMeC will work in practice during the Implementation Phase.

The ESIMeC story

Over 26m people are unemployed in Europe - one in ten of the economically active people does not have a job. Most countries are in a sustained period of slow economic growth.
There have been signs of recovery but it seems that, if it comes, this will be an unequal recovery with some winners and some losers.
There is also a massive increase in temporary or precarious employment in some countries.
In Spain, for example, over 60% of young people in employment are on short term contracts
against the EU average of just under 40% for young people. At the same time employers
continue to report recruitment difficulties and a shortage of talent in the labour market so
we are, in some countries, in a seemingly contradictory situation where unemployment and
vacancies are both on the rise.
The ESIMeC II project focused on the unique position of medium sized cities. It is one of the
three so called URBACT ‘delivery pilots’ funded to test whether transnational exchange and
learning continues to be useful during the implementation of Local Action Plans. The pilots
were delivered from early in 2014 to March 2015.
It builds on the first phase of ESIMeC during which 8 medium sized cities explored innovative
approaches to economic recovery, growth and resilience and concluded that people were
at the heart of the solution. So, cities need to adopt a demand-led approach to workforce
development to ensure that their people have the skills needed both now and in the future.
To do this they need to put long-term workforce development strategies in place in their
cities, placing equal emphasis on the demand side of the labour market (what employers
want from workers now and in the future) as on the supply side (how to ensure that people
are prepared for 21st century jobs). A first ESIMeC Cookbook was produced and contained
a series of recipes on partnership working, skills forecasting, preparing young people for the
world of work and integrated approaches to skills and and employment development.
One of the key outputs of the first phase of work was the co-production with local
stakeholders of a Local Action Plan in each of the cities. Five of the original partner cities
have now had an opportunity to continue to work together whilst delivering their Local Action
Plans. At the beginning they investigated and agreed a number of common challenges and
barriers to delivery. These included:
• The macroeconomic context which means that cities in many cases simply do not have
enough jobs to go around - how can they grow jobs in this context?
• Difficulties maintaining multi stakeholder engagement - how can cities foster effective
and ongoing involvement from local stakeholders in the delivery of Local Action Plans?
• A lack of momentum, motivation or even credibility after EU funding (URBACT)
had ended - how can this be maintained amidst other competing priorities
and in the context of reduced resources?

• Effective data collection and measuring impact - how do we define the change
we seek to achieve through our LAPs? How do we ensure that the data we
collect is effective, relevant and meaningful?
• A lack of human and financial resources - linked to the contraction in the
public purse and exacerbated by the fact that delivery started as most EU
funding programmes were ending - how can cities do more with less; what
are the ‘smart’ solutions?
A series of transnational events was organised to explore these questions in
more depth. These brought together local and international experts and this
second ESIMeC cookbook collates the main learning of interest to other cities.

1. Governance, Leadership and Stakeholder Engagement

The URBACT approach to integrated sustainable urban development often requires cities to explore and test new and different ways of working towards a long term goal and a series of objectives and actions which make up their local action plan.
ESIMeC cities concluded in the early stages of their Delivery Pilot, that governance, leadership and stakeholder
engagement make a huge difference to potential impact when delivering local action plans.
“A large part of the success of integrated development projects depends on the governance framework within
which they operate and on the capacity to involve all scales and tiers of government”.
“Good practices (....in participatory processes....) are those that succeed in sowing the seed of change and in
engaging public authorities in reflection on the effectiveness of public participation in local micro projects as well
as in governance more broadly”
Both of these statements are taken from DG Regio’s Study “Urban Development in the European Union. Fifty
Projects supported by the European Regional Development Fund between 2007 and 2013” which includes
many examples (both good and bad) of integrated project delivery and is just one of the large body of research,
literature and rhetoric which exists on these interlinked themes.
But how meaningful and practical are these findings in the context of local action plan delivery in the ‘average’
European medium sized city? How many municipalities, for example, actually systematically reflect on their
‘governance mechanisms’? Would it be appropriate for them do to so in the current context of limited public
sector budgets or would they be better concentrating their scarce resources on delivery of public services on
the ground? How would it go down in your city hall if you suggested setting up a ‘multi level governance task
force’? Would anyone even understand what this means?
So, what are the key ingredients needed to optimise the conditions for effective governance, leadership
and stakeholder engagement?

Horizontal integration.

The effective delivery of integrated local action
plans requires strong horizontal integration in
the form of greater and better interaction and
cooperation between people, sectors and
organisations working in the same city at the
same level. There are lots of barriers here,
not least the deeply embedded traditions in
professions and sectoral thinking: economists
and planners for example come from different
academic backgrounds and rarely habitually
reflect upon the impact of their actions on
each other.
So cities need to consider institutional change
leading to new decision making structures
within which different departments and
agencies reflect upon and proactively consider
the impact of actions on all stakeholders and
on all levels. To kick start the process cities
may, for example, set up a new cross sectoral
or cross departmental working group. They
could organise a series of informal events
(brown bag lunches; lunch and learns, etc.)
where people share their approaches to
different city challenges. Cities may also
consider more radical approaches e.g.
departmental mergers to enable stronger
exchange; a job rotation programme to help
people better understand each others’ roles;
a central funding pot to which all stakeholders
contribute to deliver integrated actions or even
ringfenced budgets for a common purpose.

Stakeholder analysis and review.

Cities and the local action plans they deliver
are ever changing bodies. As the socioeconomic,
policy and legislative context
changes, so too must the city’s people and organisations who are charged with local
action plan delivery. It is therefore important
to regularly analyse and review stakeholders
- perhaps to physically ‘map’ them according
to the concepts and objectives in the local
action plan. Cities should also be prepared
to think ‘outside the box’ when considering
stakeholders and to be honest when reflecting
upon whether participative approaches are
genuine or hollow. They need to think about
who has been left out and who is missing
and to consider the ‘unusual suspects’. The
URBACT stakeholder influence / interest matrix
is a useful tool to help this process.

New forms of leadership.
Leadership does not have to be a single,
monolithic structure. Within the context of
an integrated local action plan, perhaps
collaborative leadership approaches are a
better fit. So, when analysing and mapping
stakeholders, it is also useful to consider
whether they have the capability and
capacity to lead parts of the local action
plan. Leadership needs to be redefined as
a key public service and this requires new
ways of looking at challenges and finding
solutions through collaborative working on
shared strategies and integrated approaches.

Structured reflection.
What is clear when considering these
inter-linked themes is that change will not
happen overnight. Neither will it be an easy
or natural process. Structured reflection
will be a prerequisite of success and the
URBACT framework and suite of tools provide
an excellent opportunity for people and
organisations to do this.
Above all, success will require time, trust
and patience.

2. Employer Engagement.

ESIMeC cities agree that working
with employers in all aspects of economic and workforce
development makes a huge difference to potential impact when
delivering local action plans. Indeed, how would it be possible to
consider issues such as job creation and business support at city level
without the effective engagement of employers?
Strengthening employer engagement is the theme of a recent OECD briefing (2013) as part of their
skills strategy spotlight series. It examines the main barriers to employer engagement before setting
out the priority areas for action to strengthen it, through actions by government and employers
themselves. Employers are urged to identify leaders and brokers who can raise awareness and
promote skills investment within the SME community (e.g. sectoral skills councils, local business
associations, chambers of commerce). Quality apprenticeships which are valued by youth and
employers alike, along with more work experience, placements and internship opportunities,
are also encouraged. The briefing suggests that employers of all sizes could - and should -
play an active role in steering and actively supporting local skills development. Key success
factors include sharing concrete examples of good practice in employer-led skills investment
and leveraging public funding for employer-led skills development to secure equivalent levels of
sustainable business investment, while ensuring accountability for results. Employers can also
help to strengthen recognition, status, career pathways and bridges to higher education thereby
promoting excellence in vocational education and training.
Clearly cities have a role to play in this agenda. Having simple and stable policies and public
funding available for employer-led skills development is cited as one area where government can
make a difference. They can also provide direct support (particularly to SMEs) and ensure that
all young people have the basic foundation skills of literacy and numeracy which are expected in
the workplace. Promotion of excellence in vocational education and training (VET) to strengthen
recognition, status, career pathways and bridges to higher education are all equally important.
Cities can also include employability as one of the performance measures by which education
and training institutions will be assessed. Qualification frameworks need to be intelligible and
meaningful for employers and, with education normally being a national policy competence, local
flexibility within this framework is key to meeting the skill needs of local employers.
So, what are the key ingredients needed to optimise the conditions for effective employer
engagement?

Effective and appropriate marketing and communication.

Some would argue that engaging employers is
actually about ‘selling’ workforce and economic
development and therefore lends itself to the use
of standard marketing techniques. This means that employers need to be made aware of what is
on offer and then their interest needs to be built
so that they start to want to work with you to
achieve an outcome which benefits all involved.
Channels and methods of communication need
to be appropriate to the desired outcome. For
example whilst emails and letters may start to
raise awareness, there is probably no substitute
for face to face meetings and networks when it
comes to actual action. It is important to work
through existing channels and networks and to
maximise peer-to-peer , that is to say employerto-
employer commitment. Social media also has
a role to play.

Lead by example.
Local authorities are often large employers in
their own right and therefore it is important that
they consider the different contributions they can
make to economic and workforce development
in the city that they serve. They can, for example,
host work experience placements, internships
and apprenticeships. They can adopt a living
wage or work (through procurement) to support
buy local campaigns and local supplier initiatives.

Define the business case.
The business case needs to be absolutely
clear. Companies speak about how engaging
with cities on the employability agenda can
challenge their usual approach to work. Some
employers also say that taking on young people
as interns or for work experience placements contributes to diversity in the workforce and
brings a new and fresh perspective to their
activity. Internships and apprenticeships also
give employers an opportunity to ‘vet’ potential
job candidates in a real work environment and
over a significant duration. In some cases, often
with larger companies, real skills shortages can
be addressed by employers working with local
training and education providers. At the same
time companies in some countries may have
a genuine interest in contributing to the local
economy. So, social responsibility can also
be a driver.

Strategic campaign or approach.

Businesses expect a business like approach
and a long term strategy. A campaign with simple
messages which are regularly reinforced is likely
to be more effective than short term or one-off
activities with long periods of nothing in between.
This sustainable long term approach also helps
employers to own the agenda.
As part of this strategy, cities need to consider
whether it is better to engage with large numbers
of local employers and potentially making quite
a ‘thin’ offer or to offer a smaller number of
employers a more extensive and probably more
impactful experience (‘thick’).
It is also useful to connect to employers when
they are considering change anyway - for
example when they are changing their strategy
or considering new market opportunities.

3.Measuring Impact.

ESIMeC cities are in the process
of implementing their Local Action Plans (LAPs).
During the Summer of 2014 they each undertook a
‘triage’ of the actions which were originally agreed when
developing the LAP and considered more in depth how
they would monitor and measure performance and impact.
The expectation from the European Commission is that the new Operational Programmes
for the European Social Fund (ESF) and the European Regional Development Fund
(ERDF) for 2014-2020 will use a new ‘results oriented intervention logic’. This includes a
clear articulation of the specific objectives with a strong intervention logic demonstrating
how these objectives meet clearly defined needs and lead to results in the form of a
‘change’ on the ground. The new programmes include result indicators with definitions
and measurable targets. This result orientation sets out the broad framework of what is
intended to be achieved, recognising that there can be other contributing factors which
can affect the result.
ESIMeC cities are keen to use the principles within this new framework to inform the way
they monitor and measure the performance and impact of their LAPs.
So, what are the key ingredients they need to bring together to effectively do this?

Common understanding of why it is important to measure.
There are many reasons to accurately measure
performance. In the most effective models
stakeholders use the findings to better understand
if actions are actually succeeding in addressing
needs. Management information can also be
useful to inform applications for future funding and
is often a requirement of external funders who
are accountable for the money they allocate. In
URBACT projects there is also a desire to better
understand if LAPs are being delivered in an
integrated way that accounts for social, economic
and environmental factors. We also want to
understand the impact of working in partnership
and the impact of transnational work on local
delivery. Finally, it is human nature to work towards
performance targets which means it is absolutely
vital that the measure is right.

Consideration of subjective methods.
Monitoring and measurement systems can collect
quantitative and qualitative information. Both are
useful for collecting and assessing projects. It is
useful for project partners to consider a range
of different methods and tools which includes
subjective methods such as surveys, focus
groups, interviews, expert opinions, document
searches and observation. These are particularly
appropriate for capturing diffuse or the slightly
intangible effects of actions such as capacity
building or awareness raising. Story-telling and
anecdotal evidence can be particularly powerful
ways of demonstrating the impact of an action
on an individual.

Embedding of performance. Framework Throughout.

The Commission’s new emphasis on
results-oriented interventions has informed the
development of all the ESF and ERDF Operational
Programmes for 2014-2020. It is not something
that can be added on at the end of project or
strategy development. Rather it is a system that
requires stakeholders to start at the end and
work backwards, embedding all elements of the
performance framework throughout the project
or action plan delivery. Management information
collected through the system will be used to
inform and improve service delivery throughout
current and future implementation. It enables you
to keep track of progress, to understand cause
and effect, to check assumptions and to better
analyse the contribution of your intervention.

Decision on which framework to use and adaptation.

Clearly it is not always appropriate to use every
element of any given framework. The key
thing is for partners and stakeholders to talk a
common language when it comes to measuring
performance and to be absolutely clear from the
outset how this will happen. Whichever framework
is used, it needs to be adapted for scale, context
and needs. Whilst there are a range of options
available, it may well be useful for cities wishing
to apply for EU funding to use the Commission’s
framework - and language - as this will help
actions and projects to fit into the EU mould.

4. Innovative financing for Local Action Plans.

ESIMeC cities are in the process of implementing their Local Action Plans (LAPs)
and one of the challenges they face is securing resources. At the
same time, the traditional grants culture is gradually changing and a variety
of new financing mechanisms are being developed and introduced. Sustained
austerity within public finances means that cities need to think differently about how
to fund their activities. This is in part driven by a need to do more with less but is also in
recognition of the fact that a grants culture can create dependency whereas other more
innovative financing methods may lead to greater and more sustainable impact.
Linked to this, cities want to be able to develop longer term approaches to sustainable
urban development. Short term projects, which are reliant on grants from external
bodies, often lack the coherence required to deliver long term strategies like those
included in URBACT Local Action Plans. The situation is mirrored at an EU level with
financial instruments being a key feature of the new Cohesion Policy programmes
for 2014-2020. Clearly cities will not be replacing their current funding strategies
completely. Rather they are starting to look at new and different ways of funding their
programmes which complement and add value to the more traditional methods.
“Looking at the socio-economic impact, it has been interesting to observe how the
organisations that have used alternative finance have generally performed well after
fundraising, with the majority of them reporting increases in employment, volunteering,
turnover or profit”.(Understanding Alternative Finance’, NESTA and University of Cambridge, 2014)

Innovative approaches to existing funding sources.

There are many reasons to explore new and
different funding mechanisms but it is also
important to ensure that cities are getting most
value out of existing programmes. European
programmes feature financial instruments
more and more and it is a good idea to look at
whether, and how, these are being used in your
city. For example, you may be able to develop
an Urban Development Fund or use Community
Led Local Development or Integrated Territorial
Investments. To find out more have a look at the
Operational Programmes which cover your city
and talk to your Managing Authorities.

Exploration of new financial methods.
Set out below are just a few of the new forms of
finance which may be relevant when exploring
funding for local projects and activities. Cities
need to take a long term approach to fund
raising. There is no quick fix. Raising money
takes time but often reaps rewards way beyond
the money itself.
So, some of the options you might like to explore
include:
a) Financial Instruments.
Financial instruments aim to recycle funds over
the long term and thereby to mobilise additional
public or private investments. They tend to target
projects with potential economic viability such
as investment in start ups or small companies,
urban infrastructure, heritage or cultural sites,
redevelopment of brownfield sites, creation of
new commercial floor space, university buildings,
renewable energy and energy efficiency
improvements.
They provide support for investments by way of
loans, guarantees, equity and other risk-bearing
mechanisms, possibly combined with technical
support, interest rate subsidies or guarantee fee
subsidies within the same operation.

b) Public-Private-Partnerships.
PPPs are medium or long term contracts
between the public and private sector for delivery
of a public service or infrastructure project. The
main innovation is that the public sector defines
what it wishes to achieve and the private sector
is given some freedom to come up with how it
will meet this expectation. In addition, some of
the risk in terms of delivery is transferred from the
public sector to the private sector. This method
fits between traditional procurement and full
privatisation of services or works.

c) Social Impact Bonds.
In some ways Social Impact Bonds are like
PPP for non capital projects in the field of social
inclusion. No actual bonds change hands. Rather
there is a contract between a provider of services
and the public sector in which a commitment is
made to pay for improved social outcomes that
result in public sector savings. Payment is usually
only made when outcomes actually meet public
sector expectations, often years after the service
is actually delivered.

d) Social Clauses in public procurement.
Over recent years there have been developments
in the interpretation of the policy and legal
frameworks surrounding public procurement that
have made it possible to consider incorporating
community and social benefit into public
contracts. The insertion of ‘social clauses’ can
enable cities to stipulate that contractors employ
certain vulnerable groups in delivering works
or services thereby increasing employment
potential.


e) Crowdfunding.
Crowdfunding is where a project is financed by
raising funds from a large number of people,
typically via the internet. There are 3 main types
of crowdfunding:
• Equity based crowdfunding - the sale of a
stake in a business to a number of investors
in return for investment
• Loan based crowdfunding - funds are
borrowed from lots of people online rather
than from a bank
• Rewards based crowdfunding - individuals
donate towards a specific project with the
expectation of receiving a tangible (non–
financial) reward or product at a later date
in exchange for their contribution
As well as raising funds, this approach also helps
to validate an idea or project and generates
enthusiasm amongst the ‘crowd’ creating
valuable advocates and project champions.

Strategic, long term approach.
Fund raising is not a short term project. It is
something that needs to be carefully considered,
scrupulously planned and executed with
precision. There is sometimes a temptation to go
for early wins as stakeholders can be impressed
by successful applications for funding. However
any tendency to dash for cash is best avoided.
The best fund raising plans are clear about
what funds are needed for from the outset and
have resources coming on-stream in a timely
and coherent way that facilitates an integrated
approach to delivery.

5. Growing jobs through entrepreneurship.

ESIMeC cities are in the process of implementing their Local Action Plans (LAPs) and
one of the challenges they face is a lack of jobs. They
believe that developing an entrepreneurial culture is key to
business creation which in turn will lead to more jobs.
The Europe 2020 strategy acknowledges the importance of entrepreneurship
and self-employment in achieving smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. For more
than a decade, the European Commission has actively promoted entrepreneurship in
response to the fact that fewer Europeans start or grow businesses than their main global
competitors.
Commission efforts in this area have included supporting business start-ups
amongst unemployed people and disadvantaged groups as well as promoting social
entrepreneurship. They have also sought to improve business innovation, growth and
sustainability rates. The importance of entrepreneurship is reflected in the Commission’s
proposals for the 2014-2020 Cohesion Policy where it is considered in at least half of
the thematic objectives. Alongside this, the Commission’s Entrepreneurship Action Plan
reinforces the need for improvement in key areas including entrepreneurship education,
access to finance and reduced regulation.
Improving rates of entrepreneurship – in both the commercial and social spheres – are
considered vital for Europe’s economic recovery. Cities have a key role to play in creating
ecosystems that promote and support enterprising attitudes and activities.

An entrepreneurship ecosystem.
An entrepreneurship ecosystem will help cities
to grow new jobs. There needs to be coherence
between the legal framework, the physical and virtual
infrastructure and human capital. The offer made
to entrepreneurs needs to be clear, transparent,
responsive, business-friendly and tailored as
appropriate to the needs of different sectors and
communities. Such a system may include a
combination of physical and virtual services, general
and specialist support services, access to start up
and crisis finance, brokerage between entrepreneurs,
financiers, government and markets and diagnostics
to evaluate ideas, risk profiles, human capital, skills
assets and deficits.

A culture of entrepreneurship and entrepreneurship education.

Even within the EU there are large variations in
entrepreneurial culture. Many cities believe that
long-term investment in entrepreneurship education,
at all levels, is vital if attitudes to entrepreneurship
are to change. Entrepreneurship education is seen
as a strategic tool to equip young people from the
earliest age with enterprising skills and attitudes. It
is best used as an integral part of education rather
than a bolt-on. Cities can work with teachers in
the school system, motivating them to work more
closely with businesses. Entrepreneurship education
does not only prepare people to start their own
company, it also creates a better workforce generally,
instilling skills that are widely sought after by
mainstream employers, such as teamwork creativity
and problem-solving (increasingly referred to as
“intrapreneurship”).
All of this needs to be backed up by good
communications to inspire a positive culture
of entrepreneurship and counteract negative
perceptions and fear of failure. Cities need to
find ways to articulate the benefits and impact of
entrepreneurship policy and practice in a way that
each audience understands.

A business-friendly environment.
As well as taking action to promote job creation
through entrepreneurship, cities need to make sure
they are good – and easy – places for businesses to
start, grow and thrive. A business-friendly approach
to regulation, planning and taxation needs to be
mixed with the conditions needed to encourage
businesses to start up e.g. the provision of affordable
business space, business advice and support,
shared spaces, incubator units, access to finance,
etc. Added to this the quality of place is important
– an environment with efficient ICT and transport
infrastructure is much more likely to be one where
sustainable businesses will grow.

Consideration of social entrepreneurship.
It is easy to forget the importance of social
entrepreneurship. Social enterprise accounts for 11
million EU jobs or 6% of total employment. There is
also evidence to suggest it is counter-cyclical – i.e.
that it grows when other parts of the economy are
in decline. 1 in 4 of the businesses set up each year
in the EU are social enterprises. Social enterprises
also aim to achieve community benefit which often
means they address multiple public policy agendas
as well as promoting a sense of social responsibility
at local level. Social franchising and consortia offer
opportunities for growth.";"24.txt";"24"

 EUniverCities.  City-University cooperation to the next level. 

Preface.  
The EUniverCities Urbact-network unites 10 medium-sized European cities that seek to improve the university-city nexus. By applying to the URBACT programme, they want to learn from each other‘s experiences and practices, and move forward as successful and inclusive knowledge cities.  This baseline study lays a foundation under the activities of the network in the coming 2.5 years. It consists of three parts: a state-of-the-art report, a set of partner profiles, and a synthesis.  Part I, the state of the art. Report, puts the topic of city-university collaboration in its international context. It contains an overview of current literature and best-practices regarding city-university co-operation. It is based on a review of the academic and policy literature, and insights of the author. This part intends to create a sound conceptual basis of the exchange activities in the next 2.5 years in the EUniverCities URBACTnetwork.  Part II contains brief descriptions of the partner cities in the network. For each city, there is a mini-chapter describing the local situation, current types of co-operation, and challenges and problems regarding the university-city nexus. This part is based on interviews held in each city, with key informants from city, university and other organizations. This part makes clear that each city has particular challenges.  Part III, finally, is a synthesis. It compares the cities with each other, wraps up, and sketches common issues and challenges in the cities. It sets the focus for the activities in the partnership.  The author wants to thank the lead partner, the City of Delft, for the trust and collaboration. Working with Patrick van Geel and Elise Verheij is a great pleasure. They did a great job in arranging the visits, together with the project partners, and largely contributed to this baseline study. Moreover, many thanks for all the interview partners for their willingness and openness to share their views and experiences regarding university-city collaboration. Special thanks are for the organisers and co-ordinators in each city, who did a great job in arranging the interviews and welcoming us so warmly. 
1. Introduction  
The EUniverCities Urbact-network unites 10 medium-sized European cities that seek to improve the university-city nexus. By applying to the URBACT programme, they want to learn from each other‘s experiences and practices, and move forward as successful and inclusive knowledge cities. This state of the art report is part I of the baseline study. It puts the topic in its international context, and contains an overview of current literature and best-practices regarding city-university co-operation. It is based on a review of the academic and policy literature, and insights of the author. This part intends to create a sound conceptual basis of the exchange activities in the next 2.5 years in the EUniverCities URBACTnetwork3.  The growing interest for city/university collaboration comes from both sides. Universities are increasingly competing with each other, and are becoming aware that an attractive urban environment (in the broadest sense) helps them to lure the best students and researchers; moreover, for a number of reasons detailed below, they increasingly develop relations with their environment, including actors within the city in which they are located. City governments, from their part, have come to recognize their universities as engines of the urban knowledge economy, in their role as sources of talent, economic development, innovations, and social and cultural dynamism (van Winden, 2010). With the massification of higher education, student numbers have grown drastically, and student populations are increasingly recognized as valuable part of the urban society. In urban planning fields and practices, students and higher education institutes (HEIs) are being recognized as key players in urban gentrification processes. The relationship between universities and cities can be characterized as one of mutual benefit, but also one of occasional conflict, negotiated tolerance, and ambivalence.  It is widely felt that the growing interconnections between HEIs, students and urban development asks for new types of policy responses. Student cities united in EUniverCities want to think thoroughly about the mutual dependencies, tensions, scopes and tools for fruitful co-operation, and develop more strategic and sustainable approaches. In this process, they want to learn from each other‘s experiences.  There is a growing mountain of academic and policy literature related to our central topic. The OECD conducted a series of Reviews of Higher Education in City and Regional Development, in which it explores for a number of cities how HEIs are aligned to the region, and how improvements can be made in this respect. And in 2011, the EC developed a Guide Connecting Universities to Regional Growth to help public authorities promote the active engagement of universities and other higher education institutions in regional innovation strategies for smart specialization, in cooperation with stakeholders. The guide explores how to overcome barriers, to build capacity and to implement partnerships and leadership processes to interconnect the partners in regional innovation systems.  It contains a wealth of practical examples from cities and regions that managed to establish fruitful partnerships and synergies. It stresses that in order to effectively support the development and implementation of smart specialisation‘ strategies, cities and their universities together need to implement increasingly complex and transformational programmes and strategies (as opposed to more transactional and short term interventions). Nordregio (2012) commissioned a study entitled Strategies for Interaction and the Role of Higher Education Institutions in Regional Development in the Nordic Countries. And there are even dedicated academic journals on the theme (Research policy, Journal of Technology Transfer, Technovation). At the EU level, the topic is hot for some years already. In 2003, the European Commission initiated a debate about the role of universities in the Europe of Knowledge, describing them as an instrument of regional development and of strengthening European cohesion (CEC, 2003, p. 21). The URBACT II Thematic Network ""The Role of Universities in Urban Poles"" addressed how universities engage with their local communities, with a focus on economic aspects (namely triple helix structures for supporting economic development and encouraging entrepreneurship).  Thus, there is a lot of knowledge and experience around. This state of the art study intends to reflect the existing body of knowledge on university-city partnership (although it cannot claim to be comprehensive, given the enormous amount of literature and the limited resources available for this state-of-the-art paper). This study intends to help the EUniverCities partners to capitalize on the large existing body of knowledge and experience; also, it identifies challenges, dilemmas and barriers that cities face in this intricate relationship, as a basis for this new partnership. Some of the issues discussed are very well documented; others remain somewhat underexplored so far, namely: issues around student life in cities, social aspects of university cities, and the integrated approaches towards managing and governing student cities.  The paper is structured around five domains of city-university partnership: local/regional economy (section 2), internationalization (section 3), students&city life (section 4), attractiveness&marketing (section 5), and Science&Society (section 6). In each domain, university and city may have a shared or common interest, and there is scope for active collaboration between city and university (see picture). Also, in each domain, there are particular tensions and challenges. As cross-sectional topic, in section 7 we also discuss urban governance6, planning and management issues related to the city-university nexus. Section 8 concludes.  The parts of the flower7 are interdependent: for example, the topic of internationalization is closely linked to attractiveness and marketing; Discussions of gentrification and elitism take place at the edge of the themes Students and city life and science and society, etc. The concluding section summarizes the key challenges and dilemmas, and identifies white spots in the available knowledge on university-city collaboration. 
8. Conclusions  
City and university are co-producers of the urban knowledge economy. The future of any university city depends to an increasing extent on the fruitful and sustainable co-operation between the two sides, in a number of fields. In this paper, we have analyzed trends, practices and opportunities for collaboration, but also sketched recurrent tensions, dilemmas and problems in the relationship. In conclusion, we identify a number of issues and dilemmas regarding the university-city connection, which may help to give direction to the focus taken in the URBACT-project:  Moving beyond the economic dimension. Over the last decades, the university-city connection was primarily framed in economic terms: spin-offs, innovation, knowledge transfer, etc., and this aspect is still highly relevant. However, it is increasingly realized that the impact is much wider, which should be reflected in co-operation. Perry (2011) notes a pronounced shift away from examining only the passive impacts or direct economic effects of universities towards greater emphasis on the wider roles and contributions of universities to urban development. (.…). These include seeing universities as active partners in growth coalitions; the social, civic and environmental contributions of universities towards locally-set priorities; or the range of activities in research, teaching and knowledge transfer that have potential local relevance. (Reconciling international excellence with local relevance. Universities face the pressure to work on applicable research, and are expected to have a direct impact on their local regions (both in education and research). At the same time, they want to be international leaders and improve their position in international rankings. With increasing internationalization, universities may grow detached from their host city or region, or at least put lower priority on local and regional networking. They may come to see themselves primarily as international players?, prioritizing the international arena. This may give rise to tensions with local authorities seeking co-operation. Breznitz and Feldman (2012) ask the question whether we are expecting too much of our universities. These new responsibilities place universities in a Catch: we expect universities to think outside the box, continuing their social and technological innovation, and we also expect them to make direct contributions to their local and national economies. This may be too much. Rethinking incentive systems. The reward structure of universities is still based on scientific publications. Academic specialists are not particularly interested in collaborating with local actors; Research networks and consortia are national or internationally oriented. Researchers are not rewarded for entrepreneurial or collaborative activity. Also, there is a lack of criteria to assess quality in collaboration.  Aligning top-down and bottom-up. There are good reasons to argue for a bottom-up approach, in which relevant stakeholders collaborate in a practical way, on a particular topic (in any one of the parts of the flower). Partnership requires trust, which is built upon previous collaboration rather than by setting up grand visions. Successful collaboration cases identified by Benneworth at al. (2010) involved several rounds of collaboration to build understanding, with trust building up not in agreeing high-level common visions, but in addressing more quotidian yet insuperable problems. There is a risk of losing the overall picture, however. A recent EC report (2011) points at the problem of fragmentation and ad-hoc policies, and calls for a more co-ordinated and strategic approach: there are a number of ways in which universities can contribute to the development of their regions strategies for innovation, growth and sustainable development (….) However in order for the benefits of these mechanisms to be maximised, it is necessary for them to take place within a coordinated framework that seeks to derive greatest effect from the mobilisation of a region‘s universities. (p. 32); In order to effectively support the development and implementation of smart specialisation‘ strategies cities and their universities together need to implement increasingly complex and transformational programmes and strategies (as opposed to more transactional and short term interventions).  Assessing the urban effects of university (re) locations and student housing. In every city, the higher education ecosystem (or studentscape) is shaped by decisions of universities (where to locate their premises and campuses), city planners (urban plans, transport schemes), housing corporations and private developers (where to invest in student housing), service providers, and students. Each actor has its own goals and rationales, but in many cases, there is little systematic assessment of the urban effects of these decisions. This may lead to sub-optimal outcomes. More strategic co-ordination and visioning could help to create an outcome that is more desirable and sustainable.  Governance: assessing adequate organizational frameworks/models for university-city cooperation. There is little systematic analysis on the governance of university-city partnerships. Evidently, each city and country is different in terms of history, culture and policy context, with deep implications for the way cities and university can best frame their partnership. Probably, there are no single winning strategies. But nevertheless, cities could learn from each other. A number of complex questions remain open: How and why do co-operations emerge?  What powers, tensions and interests shape the relation? What barriers to co-operation exist, and how can they be overcome? What(formal and informal) modes for co-operation do we observe, and how adequate are they? Does co-operation lead to the desired outcomes, and for whom? How do various scales (local, regional, national, international) interact in this regard? Do we see a happy families? of city and university, or rather shot-gun marriages? The city as living lab: Systematically exploring the city as a source of problems/challenges for researchers and students. The city is a very rich environment, a living lab for students and researchers. The university can do much to help addressing urban problems and challenges of all kind; moreover; the city can benefit greatly from the energy and fresh ideas of students. Some cities have taken steps in this direction, and the field is expanding; networks are growing around the theme11. But more strategic frameworks would help to increase the impact.

Synthesis 
1. Introduction.The EUniverCities Urbact-network unites 10 medium-sized European cities that seek to improve the university-city nexus. By applying to the URBACT programme, they want to learn from each other‘s experiences and practices, and move forward as successful and inclusive knowledge cities.  City and university are co-producers of the urban knowledge society. The future of any university city depends to an increasing extent on the fruitful and sustainable co-operation between the two sides, in a number of fields. The city-university nexus has many layers, and is embedded in different national contexts (setting the scene for higher education and research). In part I of this study (the state-of-the-art paper), we analyzed trends, practices and opportunities for collaboration, but also sketched recurrent tensions, dilemmas and problems in the relationship; Part II described the situation in each of the partners.  In this chapter, we synthesise the findings of the individual city reports, and derive conclusions and implications for the organisation of the activities in the network.  In section 2, we compare the cities with each other, and seek some common lines but also main differences. Section 3 unveils the main focal themes to be addressed during the project, and section 4 summarizes the main challenges of the 10 cities involved.  2. Key challenges and differences  Table 1 shows some key figures of the partner cities. The % of students varies between 8% (Magdeburg) and 34% (Lecce), but most cities have a rate of around 20%. Thus, the student population is substantial. The ten cities in the EUniverCities network share some important common features. All of them are medium sized cities (seen from their national context), and the institutes of higher education (HEIs) play a very significant role in city life. All of them share the ambition to take the university-city partnership a step further.  All universities face the challenge to increase external funding (through contract research for the industry, and participation in national & European research programmes). Unconditional university funding is decreased, and funding depends less on student numbers. This puts pressure on university to develop or intensify relations with companies, and in many of the partner cities we see a growing orientation of the university towards the local economy and society. For high-ranking universities (such as Aachen or Delft) this is much less the case: their orientation is mainly (inter)national.  In many countries, national governments are rewarding excellence, and increasingly provide extra financial incentives for universities that stand out in research or education (the German Exzellenz Programme is a prime example). Internationalisation is an issue in many of the partner cities. It has various dimensions, including attracting international students and staff, providing English-language courses, encouraging local students to study abroad, or engaging in all sort of international networks and partnerships. The focus is different in each partner city. Some cities face a shrinking captive regional market for students, as a result of ageing population, and seek to attract international students to fill the void (Lublin, Magdeburg, Lecce). Many cities in the partnership are looking for ways to increasing their attractiveness as student city, and see important role for city-university partnership to realise this ambition.  In the Nordic countries (and in Belgium and The Netherlands as well), international students are more than welcome too, but here we found also a critical orientation: the question is raised whether it makes (economic) sense to educate foreign students, often for free, only to see them move back home after graduation. Swedish universities recently started to charge foreign Master students (numbers dropped dramatically since, in Linkoping), and the debate is how to integrate foreign students more firmly in the region. Furthermore, in many cities, international students are not deeply integrated in local student life. There is a shared ambition to change this.  In all cities, the university is regarded as an engine of the local economy. At the same time, many interviewed actors feel that the power of the engine is not fully being exploited. Most partners have ambitions to increase technology transfer, innovation, valorization, and science-based entrepreneurship, and want to learn from each other how to do this effectively. Retaining graduates is a widely shared ambition. In most partner cities, a large chunck of students move away after graduation, and the question is raised how to retain our graduates. Many different actions are undertaken, with some innovative approaches reaching out to companies in the wider region (Linkoping, Aachen). More in general, realizing regional cooperation in the 3helix (with neighbouring cities or regional/provincial authorities) is a key theme.  Differences  Despite these commonalities, there are many differences between the partner cities. First of all, the cities are located in 9 different countries, each with their own specific national policy contexts (science and education policy and other relevant policies) and academic traditions. Regarding their academic profile, some partner cities offer a wide variety of disciplines, others just a limited range; some have only one university, others have two or more, and there are large differences regarding their position in university rankings. Concerning urban geography and planning, in some cities, teaching and research is mainly concentrated in university campus areas (Aveiro, Delft, Linkoping, Magdeburg); in others, university activities are spread over the city (Ghent, Lublin); some cities have mixed models (Aachen, Lecce, Tampere, Varna). This geographical make-up has an impact on the city-university relation, as we will discuss later.  Moreover, the partner cities and their regions vary in terms of their economic structure: some of the partner cities are in wealthy regions with very advanced industries and companies, that function as natural partners of the university, and more easily absorb university graduates (Tampere, Linkoping, Ghent, Aachen, Delft); others are located in regions with few high-tech firms or advanced services, making the connection more difficult (Aveiro, Lecce, Lublin, Magdeburg, Varna, to a varying degree). In other words: the absorptive capacity is much higher in advanced economies.  In terms of co-operation between city and university, we also observe a large variety of traditions and approaches, and each city faces its particular challenges. To some extent, these differences stem from the different development stages and contexts in which cities are. We observe differences in collaboration cultures (that are often typical for the nation in which the city is located). On the one hand, there are decentralised models, where cities and universities have relatively much autonomy (in the low countries, the Nordic countries, and Germany); here we see more elaborated types of co-operation. In more centralised traditions, collaboration seems to come less naturally.  Without disregarding the uniqueness of each city, is possible to distinguish between three broad types of cities in the EUniverCities partnership. Tentatively we propose the following groups: 1) Established cities of learning, 2) Academic newcomers and 3) Technology Specialists. Cities within each type share some important features and challenges, as will be elaborated below.  The first group are the established cities of learning: Ghent and Lublin belong in this group. In these cities, universities exists for a long time, and have been a defining part of the city for a very long period, and as a results, there is a very deep embedding of the university in all the aspects of urban life. They are widely known as typical university cities, as their identity is defined by the university presence. Often, the university covers a broad range of academic fields. Schools and university buildings are scattered all over the city centre, with some eventual extensions at more suburban locations. Students also tend live in the centre of the city, rather than in large dormitories. Cultural life in these cities heavily depends on student audiences and students are typically very active as producers of culture as well. The city is a natural platform for all sorts of academic manifestations and activities.  These cities have faced (or still face) the challenge to accommodate steeply growing numbers of students, brought by the massification of higher education. There is increasing pressure on urban space: universities need to expand their infrastructures, but it‘s not always easy to do it in the city centre where so many other activities compete for space; providing housing for students can also be a problem; the studentification of some city neighbourhoods leads to tensions with other inhabitants. Public transport & logistics solutions are needed to accommodate growing numbers of students.  The second group of cities are the Academic Newcomers: Aveiro, Lecce, Linkoping, Magdeburg and Tampere and Lecce (to a lesser extent) are in this group. Typically, these cities did not have a university at all until the 1960s or 1970s. New universities or faculties were set up in these cities to accommodate the growing number of students, but also with a view to strengthen the local and regional economy by providing companies with skilled graduates and sound research partners (This happened in Linkoping, where Saab was one of the initiators; in Magdeburg, the university produced‘ engineers for the machine building industry).  These university cities have some typical features. One is the dominant Campus Model: universities were built according to the suburban campus model, outside the city centre, often in a Greenfield location, and typically of a mono-functional character (i.e. only education and research buildings, no dormitories and amenities). Second, as they were set up to service the local economy, the profile of these universities is practice oriented (and this is often how they present themselves). They are relatively well engaged with local firms, and some have developed very practically oriented educational approaches (i.e. Problem Based Learning in Linkoping).  At the same time, in social and cultural terms, in these cities, city and university are less naturally intertwined than the first group. A blue collar culture is strongly present in some cities (typically, these cities have a rich industrial past, which remains part of the their identity), and this does not always match well with academia. The physical disconnection between city and campus exacerbates the distance. Students do not dominate street life, they are much less visible, and often live at the campus or near the campus rather than in the city centre. Student life largely takes place at the campus as well, and students feel attached more to the university (and the campus) than to the city.  These cities face some common challenges. One is to address the mental and physical distance between city and university (Aveiro, Linkoping). Cities want to profit more from the liveliness that students bring. In Linkoping, stakeholders realise that the 1960s/1970s campus concept no longer meets the needs of new generations of students and researchers; in the growing competition for brains, cities need to create inspiring environments, defined as mixed, lively, and dynamic. The Vallastaden project is an attempt to realise that.  The third group of cities in our project are the High Tech Specialists (Aachen and Delft). Both cities are home to a world-class technology university, with a strong international orientation; research groups have industry relations with leading companies all over the world. Their very quality makes them attract a relatively high (and increasing) share of foreign students and PhDs from all over the world. As a consequence, these universities in these cities have an international rather than regional orientation. From the university perspective, the host city is mainly relevant as a home, temporary or permanent, for their increasingly international workforce. A key challenge is to create an attractive international environment. The relation between city and university is framed by this orientation. These cities face some other particular features, such as a strong overrepresentation of male students (who still dominate technical study fields), and a strong record of business start-ups (that seen to come more naturally in technical universities).  3. City-university partnership: towards a thematic Focus in the partnership. City-university collaboration can cover a lot of policy domains. In the partner profiles, we elaborated how cities and universities collaborate in practice, and where they have ambitions. We deployed the flower model as a way to distinguish between various types of co-operation.  Figure 1 gives an overview of the domains where co-operation currently takes place. As can be read from the partner profiles, each city has its particular strengths in parts of the flower. In the 2.5 years period, we cannot claim to cover each and every aspect of the flower. Therefore, based on the baseline study and the challenges of the cities identified, we chose three core themes and one crosscutting theme.  1) Creating living labs where students/researchers help to solve real-life problems and challenges of actors in the urban society & economy. For this to materialise, organised matching structures are needed. Some cities in the partnership have ample experience in this field. In terms of the flower model, this theme takes together elements of science in society and students & City life.  2) Enhancing urban attractiveness for (international) students and knowledge workers. This theme includes collaboration between city and university with respect to internationalisation, place making, improving urban hospitality for students and knowledge workers, but also joint marketing. Thus, it takes together the topics of internationalisation and attractiveness. But it may also include aspects of students & city life, mainly with regard to the integration of foreign students. 3) Promoting urban economic development in a regional context. This includes the promotion of science-based entrepreneurship, technology transfer, and valorisation, not only in technical studies. The regional dimension (collaboration in the region with surrounding cities, villages and regional governments) is a key element in this theme.  4) Crosscutting theme of Governance: how to develop an effective partnership? How to get a partnership started, find a common agenda and make it work? How to align different interests and agenda‘s, how to deal with tensions and conflicts? This crosscutting topic is relevant for all cities, but particularly pressing for cities without a tradition of strategic city-university partnership.  4. Main focus and challenges in each city. In this section, we summarize the main focus and challenges for the years to come, as mentioned during the baseline visits made to each city. In each partner city, city and university will elaborate a focused local action plan as co-production of different urban stakeholders united in the local support group.  Aachen: The local support group in Aachen will consist of the key decision makers in the university and the city, representatives from scientific institutes, and students. The main challenge for city and university is to further deepen the relation in general, and specifically work on the issue of attractiveness and marketing: how to attract foreign students, how to position Aachen stronger as science and knowledge city; Moreover, it wants to adopt a more integrated approach, thinking through the relation with other policy fields, i.e. cultural policies, housing, transportation etc.  Aveiro: key challenges are: 1) Developing a more strategic platform/framework for city-university collaboration, 2) Working on the identity of Aveiro as city of students and knowledge, recognized and respected by citizens of Aveiro. Currently, academia and city are separate worlds, not only physically but also in many other respects; 3) Creating conditions to improve the position of Aveiro as City of Innovation within a knowledge economy city concept; 4) Enhancing the role of the city in sustaining and further developing the strategic partnership between the university and the region; 5) creating conditions for students to stay in Aveiro after the conclusion of their studies.  Delft: The local support group in Delft consists of the key decision makers in the university and the city, and representative(s) from the student community. The focus of the group covers 1) elaborating hospitality, 2) structures for living labs, and 3) designing actions to integrate foreign students more into the city and mingle with national students. Further discussions within the LSG must bring more clarification on the focus of the peer review.  Ghent: The local support group in Ghent considers it as a major challenge for city & university to manage the growth of Ghent as city of students, research and innovation. Currently, there is a lack of space for research, for student housing, and for innovative business, and there is no reason to believe that the pressure will decrease in the (near) future. This problem cannot be solved in an integrated and sustainable way when each actor (university departments, housing corporations, city departments) try to solve their individual problems individually, or on an ad-hoc basis. It is strongly felt that a long-term shared vision is needed, taking into account the interrelationships between institutions and policy domains. During the EUniverCities project, the local support group –consisting of the key stakeholders- intends to elaborate a vision and a strategy how to manage growth and create space for innovation, research and education.  Lecce: From the cities‘ perspective, two themes are particularly important. The first is to increase spin-offs and create more business related to the university; the second is to enhance the citizenship of students and young people in general. For the university, the priority parts of the flower that could be developed in the Urbact project are marketing, attractiveness and internationalisation.  Linköping: The LSG has identified the following key challenges: 1) Attracting and retaining students: How to make Linköping a more attractive city for students; how to retain students ?; 2) Research commercialization and entrepreneurship, in particular in non-technology realms; 3) Placemaking, identity & marketing: Creating regional strength and profile (connected to the project LinköpingsBo2016); marketing the region together as Knowledge Region. Lublin: A focal challenge is emerging, which can be summarized under the heading making students work for the city. The idea is to let Lublin students or researchers (from any university) gain practical experience by working on issues relevant for the city, as part of the curriculum (internships, thesis work, project work in teams), or as a way of doing voluntary work. This could benefit the urban society and enhance the quality of education (teaching students more practical skills). The Local Support groups considers to work towards building a platform or organisation that functions as an intermediary between relevant, practical questions and challenges of actors in the Lublin society (the city administration, schools, companies, or any other organisation), and universities on the other hand. Developing a platform like this could be a new step in the complex collaboration process between city and its many universities.  Magdeburg: The local support group in Magdeburg considers it as a major challenge to enhance the role of the university as engine of the local and regional economy. Currently there is a lack of jobs for which an academic degree is needed. Many students leave the city after graduation. A key challenge for Magdeburg is to make the economy more knowledge-intensive. Suggested solutions are to focus more clearly on some (academic) strengths where links with companies are promising; another is to raise entrepreneurship and the number of start-ups. How to do this is a complex question, and Magdeburg hopes to learn from other cities in this respect.  Tampere: The local support group in Tampere will consist of the key decision makers in the university and the city. Unipoli, as an existing platform/group where high level officials from city and all universities participate, could be a good group to build upon. The focus of the group naturally (though not necessarily) lies in the field of joint marketing and communication; An alternative direction is to elaborate more on the theme of science & society. Further discussions within the LSP must bring more clarification.  Varna: The local support group will consist of the key decision makers in the university and the city, representatives from scientific institutes, and students. The local support group may help city & universities to further deepen their relation, and together address the issues and challenges listed above. One option is to focus on the theme how students and universities can participate in projects that are relevant for the city. Varna could host a special event on this theme, and it has something to show to the visitors. During the project, the city hopes to get inspiration from the knowledge exchange with other cities, and use it as inputs for its own strategy.

"Electric Vehicles in Urban Europe. 
Introduction. 
1.2 EVUE  
EVUE stands for Electric Vehicles in Urban Europe. It is an URBACT Thematic Network of ten cities, led by Westminster City Council in London. The overall aim of EVUE is to explore, exchange and implement ideas on how cities can develop integrated and sustainable strategies to increase the use of electric vehicles. The objectives are to: Promote exchange of experience and learning amongst policy makers and practitioners about introducing electric vehicles as part of an integrated and multimodal transport plan. Disseminate the lessons drawn from the exchange and ensure transfer of knowledge, and maximise the impact of the transnational exchange, both within the EVUE partnership and beyond. Support better action planning for city wide transport polices that incorporate introduction of electric vehicles. Speed up the policy innovation processes and contribute to an information base for the ‘long term revolution’ of clean car use in European cities  The EVUE partner cities are:  Westminster City Council, UK, Lead Partner. Lisbon and Beja, Portugal. Madrid, Spain. Frankfurt, Germany. Oslo, Norway. Stockholm, Sweden?. Suceava, Romania. Zografou, Greece. Katowice, Poland.  The ten cities represent a good geographical spread, a balance between Competitiveness and Convergence regions of Europe and a range of electric vehicle knowledge levels, from some of the most advanced cities to those starting from zero in challenging conditions.  EVUE belongs to the URBACT Thematic Pole of Low Carbon Cities. Its results will feed into European sustainable development policies, linked to urban environment, transport and mobility. 
4. Conclusions and call to action  
4.1 The common challenges  
The Overview chapter and EVUE city profiles of this Baseline Report document the variety of strategies and challenges for increasing the uptake of electric vehicles within and beyond the EVUE network.  EVUE benefits from a good geographical spread with a range of technical and knowledge levels, from the most advanced in Europe to absolute starting points. Political and economic contexts across the partner cities differ, with variations in average GDP, in available resources for investment, attitudes to the environment and general car cultures. The individual city profiles and the table of Partner Inputs outline the expertise and perspectives that each city will bring. This constitutes a rich and diverse source of experience and information to feed into the URBACT EVUE exchange programme.  The commonality across all EVUE partner cities, regardless of current status, is the reality of being at the beginning of a long term innovation process. This is uncharted territory, and cities are facing complex challenges and high levels of risk. As a result all EVUE cities are hungry for practical knowledge on how electric vehicles strategies are working elsewhere. The common questions arising in all cities are:  What is the business model?  What role does the city play?  How do we make electric vehicles more acceptable, attractive, and affordable?  What infrastructure is needed and what is the partnership model for investment and implementation?  What is the best regulatory framework?  How do we get started?   

4.2 Questions at the heart of EVUE  
During the EVUE Development Phase each city completed a baseline questionnaire, hosted a visit from the Lead Partner and Lead Expert and participated in two network meetings. During this process many questions emerged which will need to be addressed by both Local Action Plans and the transnational exchange.  This section elaborates the many and wide ranging questions relevant to cities.  
4.2.1 What are the business models for electric vehicles?  
This incorporates many elements, such as: Who should pay for infrastructure development and how? Where should charging points be located, and should they be fast or slow charging? How can they best be incorporated into the public realm to avoid street clutter and design out any likely health and safety issues from trip hazards? How can urban planning regulations for new developments and construction be adapted to support an increase in electric vehicles and charge points? What is the best technology and system architecture for user-friendliness and to future proof investments? What are the options for payment systems and how are they integrated into the infrastructure?  How can standards be set to avoid incompatibilities between plugs and charging points? How do countries in challenging economic and political contexts get started?  How can vehicles be made more affordable? How can the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) be communicated and accepted? How do cities secure the purchase of the first tranche of electric vehicles for municipal fleets at reasonable cost? How can procurement be used as a tool to lever in sufficient volumes and purchasing power, set and achieve electric vehicles targets, and encourage suppliers to convert fleets? What national incentives have been tried and how effective are they?  How is energy supply managed? What is the role of the electricity companies?  How can electricity providers be active stakeholders in developing electric vehicles markets? How well are existing models working? Do regulations need to change to charge for electricity on municipally owned land? To what extent can and should electric vehicles use green or clean energy, and what are the consequences for electricity supply? How can cities develop and capitalise on smart grids?  What is the best regulatory and fiscal framework? How can cities use short term incentives, such as free charging and parking, to encourage uptake, whilst planning for an economically viable and sustainable scenario in the longer term? How can the potential negative consequences of electric vehicles incentives be managed? How can cities prevent and monitor modal shift from public transport, cycling and walking to electric vehicles? What, if any, are the new safety issues- airbags, electromagnetic fields, rescue services, feeder pillars-for cities to assess risk?  How can all the stakeholders be brought together in partnership to cooperate in electric vehicle development? What are the best public private investment models, and how do they change as the market matures? What are the respective roles and interfaces between national government, regions, cities and commercial stakeholders such as car and charging point manufacturers, and energy suppliers? Who leads the process?  How can cities measure the benefits of electric vehicles and develop evidence of the business case? What are the right indicators?   
4.2.2 How do cities raise awareness amongst citizens and electric vehicles drivers of the future?  
As well as attractive options for fleet owners, electric vehicles need to become acceptable to mainstream car buyers and not be the preserve of the environmental activists. Manufacturers are working on models that have improved range, comfort and design, that can eventually substitute family cars. An informed and supportive consumer base needs to be built. Electric vehicles car owner associations exist in each country and are coordinated at European level by AVERE. How can the public be informed about the benefits of electric vehicles? Which are the best ways to educate younger people and will they influence their parents’ consumption? Can existing electric vehicle drivers of fleet and private cars be supported as ‘ambassadors’? If so, how?   
4.2.3 How can political support be gained?  
It is vital that politicians and the media are well informed about electric vehicles. Cross party, long term political support is needed to sustain the investment and commitment required to effectively introduce electric vehicles. What are the winning arguments for different audiences? How can cities build and anchor political support for electric vehicles? How will competing challenges for road space and on street parking be addressed? What targets are realistic and achievable for cities?  
4.2.4 Can electric vehicles contribute to sustainable business and job growth for low carbon economies?  
Green technologies are a key focus of strategies to re-orient economic development in line with environmental priorities in both Europe and the USA. Many such policies have been given extra stimulus since the financial crisis. How can cities generate business and job growth through the electric vehicle value chains? How can electric vehicles promote strategic economic development of a region? How can cities harness their knowledge institutions for competitive advantage?   

4.3 Knowledge exchange  
4.3.1 Transnational meeting framework  
During the course of the two EVUE network meetings held during the Development Phase the challenge was to take the rich source of information and experience described in previous sections and to develop a transnational meeting framework to reflect and incorporate the specific inputs, expertise and learning needs of each city. (See Summary of partner inputs)  The information was first streamlined into key priority topics to be addressed. The topics then had to be translated into an activity plan for both the transnational exchange and Local Planning processes. In terms of the challenges relating to electric vehicle strategies the common questions arising in all cities related to a wide range of interrelated issues including business models, the role of cities, infrastructure, partnership models for investment and implementation, regulatory frameworks, affordability and acceptability of electric cars, awareness raising of benefits.  The three areas of focus for EVUE, which partners feel merit more in depth analysis are: Infrastructure, Procurement and Awareness Raising. These themes allow EVUE to focus on issues that correspond directly to the competences of cities, and on which they can have the most impact.  To provide insight into the broader and overarching context that these three sub-themes feed into, EVUE will also identify and document existing electric vehicle business models for implementing EV strategies. By ‘business model’ we mean the combination and interrelation of elements, such as vision, principles, infrastructure, market and customers, communications, operational processes, financing (cost and revenue), and cost-benefit analysis that will underpin electric vehicle strategies. The EVUE programme is an ambitious one. The participating cities are enthusiastic about and committed to the EVUE exchange. All partners are willing to contribute ideas, time and knowledge to achieve results, and believe that participation will enrich local planning for electric vehicle strategies.  Whilst it is important to understand the context of EU standards, national plans, regulatory frameworks, and indeed all the wider technical and economic questions listed above, EVUE will retain an emphasis on the learning and coordination steps required by city policy makers to deliver clean car strategies.  The summary of partner inputs below will feed into the transnational exchange programme.  
4.4 Conclusions  
Electric vehicles will contribute to a greener, cleaner Europe. Cities have a vital role to play. They need to take the lead in incentivising the use of electric vehicles by citizens and businesses, and lead by example in converting their own fleets. It is clear that this process is underway and irreversible. It is equally clear that it is a complex innovation process,that requires high levels of investment, active participation of all agencies in the value chain, and an integrated, strategic approach.  EVUE will provide a platform for the rapid exchange and diffusion of up to date knowledge on urban electric vehicles strategies. It will help cities to create economies of scale and avoid costly mistakes. URBACT will be supporting the creation of a knowledge base in a new area of urban mobility policy, about which relatively little is known or tested. Through generating awareness and building capacity the results of EVUE can be mainstreamed into city policymaking to inform the design of future strategies delivering low carbon cities.

"EVUE II

Electric Vehicles in Urban Europe .
FOREWORD
The shift to emission free urban transport has progressed significantly over the last few years as the political and regulatory agenda has aligned with new developments in vehicle and battery technology. Although new vehicles such as the BMW i3 & i8, Tesla Model S or Nissan Leaf have received the accolades and media coverage, a considerable amount of effort has been expended at the national, regional and local level to provide a complementary framework that is supportive of electro-mobility. The original Electric Vehicles in Urban Europe (EVUE) project commenced in 2009 so that leading European cities looking at e-mobility could learn from each other and ensure the transition to emission free urban transport could be as smooth as possible. While that project successfully concluded in 2013, a follow up project (EVUE II) has been funded by the URBACT programme to look in more detail at the issues being faced by cities implementing e-mobility strategies. Across Europe there are significant variations in understanding, expertise, financial capacity and community willingness to move away from the internal combustion engine and these each create barriers to change. This baseline report reflects on some of the challenges being faced by EVUE II cities and proposes an approach to how cities can move past these issues. It is envisaged that by the end of the EVUE II project, not only will further transnational learning and exchange have occurred, but concrete improvements to the implementation of e-mobility supporting actions will be realised. The EVUE II project is one of three trial Pilot Delivery Networks that URBACT has funded and will provide learning which can be incorporated into the new URBACT III programme. 
1. INTRODUCTION – EVUE A VEHICLE FOR CHANGE?
1.1. Point of departure.
General aspirations to continually advance development, especially economic development, have consistently and logically resulted in increased demand for transport. However society is increasingly aware of the pressures generated by intensification in this sector, not least the problems of balancing accessibility, congestion and provision of infrastructure and services. More importantly the negative external impacts of this trend are evident in both the real effects on health, well-being and general quality of life of the world`s population - and in the potential ongoing threat posed if mitigation measures are not rigorously applied. Transportation today can still be regarded as a dominant source of environmental pollution – operating at both the global (climate change) and regional/local dimension (air quality, noise). In Europe greenhouse gas emissions from transport activity continue to rise, in contrast with other major sectors, while road transport alone (predominantly driven by the internal combustion engine) produces +/- 20% of the EU`s total carbon dioxide emissions. Some estimates suggest that “urban mobility accounts for 40% of all CO2 emission from road transport and up to 70% of other pollutants from transport” (particulates etc.)1. Cities by their very nature undoubtedly suffer most from a full range of negative transport related impacts (congestion, diminished air quality, high noise levels, more road accidents…), and their downstream consequences which ultimately and inevitably translate once again into economic cost. It was within this climate that the EVUE project was set up, amid ever growing concern that existing patterns of mobility and “business as usual” transport options are not sustainable. The development and implementation of innovative transport solutions were not stepping up to the plate quickly enough to adequately support achievement of EU 2020 objectives and particularly the accompanying 20/20/20 climate/energy headline targets. In 2009 nine cities from across Europe committed to work together and focus on clearing a path to stimulate the take-up of electric vehicles as part of a drive towards an integrated and sustainable approach to urban mobility management. Network partners clearly recognized that e-mobility alone cannot solve all the challenges facing cities in transportation terms (take congestion for example), and that questions of upstream emissions, full life-cycle and well to wheel analysis remain central considerations. However the potential of electricity to reduce direct exhaust pipe emission, to deliver low carbon energy when supply is produced from essentially carbon neutral sources and to benefit from future smart grid solutions provided compelling motivation for network activity. Now four years on, the URBACT programme and six of the original network partners have agreed to assess evolution and progress made, by examining the achievements of the city Local Action Plans. Through this 15 month pilot initiative, the intention is to draw valuable conclusions on the EVUE partner implementation process, to share information and experience, highlighting success factors and obstacles encountered - within the context of reporting important changes in attitude and practice in relation to the theme in recent years. 
1.2. Where has EVUE travelled from?
In the first EVUE project period, activity centred around the establishment or strengthening of the e-mobility foundations upon which city partners could identify and promote key actions to encourage the uptake of electric vehicles. The distinction between establishment and strengthening is important here, reflecting the diversity of conditions in the different EU member states and cities represented. Oslo and Stockholm2 for instance were already advanced in gaining acceptance for electric vehicles and at least engaged in integrating this component of individual mobility into the wider urban mobility package. In contrast Katowice and Suceava were keen to explore how to generate a momentum in what would be a relatively new orientation for the public authority. During the course of the transnational exchange EVUE partners picked out 4 critical issues to be addressed by the project – these topics pinpointed as both challenges and opportunity to advance initiatives aimed at achieving effective levels of electric vehicle operation: 1. Business Models. 2. Procurement. 3. Infrastructure. 4. Awareness. These transversal themes were used to focus partner exchange and problem-solving, and to inform the process of developing relevant Action Plans designed to address specific local situations. This task, in each city, was then carried out in cooperation with a team of theme-concerned stakeholders, the URBACT local support group (ULSG). The resulting Local Action Plans can be categorised as follows: Beja: Municipal plan for electric mobility. Frankfurt: Action plan to promote the use of electric vehicles in Frankfurt am Main Katowice: Plan to elaborate an electric mobility development strategy..Oslo: Programme of public charging point installation..Suceava: Local Action Plan for the promotion and implementation of the electric vehicles and charging infrastructure of Suceava..Westminster: Programme to support city-wide e-mobility with focus on developing electric freight vehicles in urban logistics 
1.3. Where is EVUE travelling to?
While many cities and stakeholders might be frustrated by the relatively slow progress in increasing the real numbers of electric vehicles on the ground, others are still not committed to the introduction of e-mobility as a viable urban transport solution. Nevertheless between 2009 and 2013 there have been some significant advances in terms of general perception, policy (public and private), regulation and practice in relation to development of e-mobility across the EU. There has been, for instance, a marked increase in the range of vehicle types and technological development on offer from the manufacturing and distribution sector – influenced by EU legislation on CO2 emission levels. In the transition between the 2006-2013 and 2014-2020 programme periods it is a good time to step back and assess changes in the state of play and how this is reflected in the EVUE network and EVUE partner experience. In relation to the four main focus areas identified by the project the pilot exercise provides the opportunity to examine how challenges have evolved, which problems have been resolved or partially addressed and which challenges remain outstanding. This knowledge can in turn, once again, be applied to the primary objective of the pilot delivery network, namely to improve the implementation of Local Action Plans (LAPs), e-mobility initiatives at the EVUE partner level - but also as support for other cities involved in implementation or setting out plans to achieve operational e-mobility goals. The LAPs of EVUE partners tackled different issues within the same thematic framework, but with cities operating at different stages in the emobility development process and within a variety of geo-political contexts. Some cities have already revised their programmes for local action in response to results achieved, or understanding gained during the project period. As a consequence there is also a diversity in terms of timing schedules for implementation and in terms of delivering concrete action. The pilot project should (through a system of self/joint assessment) allow EVUE cities to:
review where they are today in delivering their LAP;
explain obstacles encountered and ongoing;
present success factors and solutions and further explore transferability;
programme new initiatives building on experience, and;
develop a procedure to monitor performance.
This approach is intended to help partner cities to effectively complete existing
programmes, and to extend the action planning process - but equally to inform and assist
other cities interested in applying similar initiatives (methods and techniques).
2. PIVOTAL THEMES / CHALLENGES ADDRESSED BY
EVUE.
2.1. Introduction.
It is no coincidence that the EVUE project emerged at a point in time which future generations might consider to have been a tipping point in the e-mobility dynamic in Europe. Expectation was that eco-friendly vehicles were about to transform existing transportation patterns, but electric vehicles occupied a very marginal niche market. While cities like Stockholm, Oslo, Rotterdam and La Rochelle were pioneering trend breaking initiatives to encourage e-mobility such as electric car sharing, public transport solutions, providing fiscal or other incentive, mobilising specialist manufacturers and installation of charging infrastructure, mainstreaming the use of individual electric vehicles remained problematic in 2009, and is still far from a done deal. The real and perceived obstacles of: limitations in performance (in comparison with ICE vehicles); “range anxiety” and inconsistent charging point distribution; poor price-performance balance and uncertainty regarding the total cost of ownership (battery, spare parts, residual value; technological insecurity, and; even comfort), combined with the “prototype” threshold to deflate any notion of swift transition in market share. However with the prospect of the adoption of the EU climate and energy package in June of 2009 and the setting out of 20/20/20 headline environmental targets, a series of pivotal changes were to reach the statute books. Where up until this point e-mobility had only featured marginally in EU legislation, EVUE was provided with a more solid base on which to build e-mobility strategies and instigate actions at the local level with realistic expectation of implementation. The network was able to use this new momentum to focus in on some of the key sticking points which were consistently limiting progress towards emobility as a vital component of the sustainable mobility mix. 
2.2. Business Models.
One of the most critical challenges to increasing levels of e-mobility, identified by the EVUE project, was the absence of appropriate business models in this relatively new transportation segment. In the project`s final report six market barriers were identified: Technological constraints (range, charging time etc);
Limited range of vehicle types ;
High initial investment cost ; 
False expectations ;
Lack of incentives ;
Lack of information or questions of information reliability.
Underlying the difficulties posed by these issues was the well recognised “chicken and egg” dilemma of no demand/no supply – no adequate supply/no demand – no infrastructure/no sales – no sales/no infrastructure. Furthermore while many local authorities were interested in catalysing a transition process, their capacity to exert real influence was limited. Generally there was no tradition of a governance structure which could unite the interests of public authorities, vehicle manufacturers, energy and service providers, transport operators and individual end-users. These impediments were also (and are still) compounded by the strong effect of local conditions in influencing market response. The report showcases some innovative local interventions which have been instrumental in exemplifying workable solutions and informing change over the intervening years. Perhaps the Oslo experience represents one of the most comprehensive approaches in terms of understanding and applying a coherent business model; or at least creating a climate where the business models of key stakeholders could be supported by assurance of mutual benefits. The introduction of fixed term incentives, both fiscal and operational (combining national and local initiatives) and provision of public charging infrastructure have created new market conditions which were important in complementing stakeholder evolutions in production and service provision decisions. The city is still wrestling with the discussions of how to deliver additional (privately funded) charging points and bill users for its own network. It is also aware that as incentives are phased out, perhaps as early as 2015, this will have consequences for the business model and the dynamic will need to be closely followed. Oslo demonstrates clearly the real possibilities which can be exploited in European cities but at the same time confirms that not all bases have been covered. Many of the barriers identified have been significantly weakened not least by efforts made by the vehicle manufacturing sector. The range of vehicle types across EVs, PHEVs and HEVs has greatly increased. Battery technology has equally advanced in terms of driving range with most EVs claiming to operate for a distance approaching 150km with many companies developing their own range extenders. Similarly fast charging technology is a technological reality if not yet widely available as part of network infrastructure provision. Since 2009, there has been considerable advancement in the understanding and development of business models but still at the European scale the number of electric vehicles on our city streets remains comparatively low. Quite apart from the need to continue to tackle all the barriers there are perhaps three key elements which present fundamental challenges for the effective operation of business models going forward:
Despite innovative marketing, leasing possibilities and decoupling of battery from purchase price, the high initial investment cost is very much perceived as an obstacle. 
Standardisation of charging infrastructure and billing modalities and adequate levels of provision are crucial to breaking the chicken and egg cycle. 
Unfavourable local conditions significantly limit the potential of business models to develop. In the simplest sense it is clear that vehicle producers do not prioritise cities where it is considered that there is no, or an immature, market. 

2.3. Procurement.
Obviously the “business model” is an essential transversal factor and there has already been mention of the limited influence (and even experience) which local public authorities can exert to drive the take-up of electric vehicles. In a Europe dominated by economic recession, lack of models and high prices remain as major stumbling blocks. One way of cranking up the stimulation potential is for institutions and authorities, but also NGOs and corporate organisations, to lead by example. Bulk and joint procurement can here operate as an efficient tool to impose sustainable purchasing criteria, to diminish arguments for resistance and pilot transition towards alternative automotive solutions – particularly in situations where individual buyers represent relatively low-purchasing volumes. For public authorities this can be particularly interesting for fleet renewal (fire, police, refuse, public works etc.) and has undoubted advantages for the public transport and logistic sectors. EVUE partners were able to set out some of the advantages of introducing such systems of procurement which can also be applied to the question of provision of charging infrastructure, including:
The ability to demonstrate demand to manufacturers ;
The potential to support the introduction of new models ;
To speed up technological advances ;
To lower cost price ;
To support arguments for infrastructure provision.
Through the crisis period it has been difficult to justify increased expenditure which electric vehicles represent and then where demand for EVs is higher than supply the market is characteristically reluctant to lower prices. Nevertheless, there have been positive examples of successful fleet and infrastructure adaptation. Where such systems of procurement are successful, suppliers are better informed about interest for their products and about eventual incentives and infrastructure support which reduces risk levels. In EVUE alone the cities of Stockholm, Frankfurt, London and Oslo for example, have had positive experiences in this respect. The application of sustainable purchasing criteria has often been supported by legislation at national level and it is also true that the cooperation of national institutions or initiatives providing match-funding (Swedish Energy Company, UK Plugged in Places scheme) has generally been significant, even indispensable, in bridging the investment gap in this pioneering phase. Procurement in itself is generally a well understood core business for city authorities but systems of bulk or joint procurement present new challenges of engaging with different procedures and stakeholders. While progress has been evident in recent years, there are still factors which require ongoing attention. 
Experience shows that bulk and joint procurement processes need to be well prepared, and many cities face a learning curve in this respect. Transfer of experience and support through exchange and learning is therefore an important facet to be continued in the new programming period. 
It will be essential to keep up pressure to raise general awareness on environmental and operational benefits and indeed encourage organisations to take up positions of leading by example. 
The questions of relatively limited appropriate vehicle types (although public transport and individual car supply has evolved significantly) and high cost analysis continue to operate as a brake on EV fleet take-up.
 2.4. E-Mobility Infrastructure.
The question of installation of infrastructure to support electric vehicles (broadly speaking availability of electric vehicle charging points) has been very much at the forefront of the “chicken and egg discussion” mentioned in relation to business models. The EVUE final report sharpens the focus in respect of charging provision – “investment in infrastructure will only be a success if vehicles are available and consumers will only purchase if supporting infrastructure is available”. This situation was particularly acute when battery technology was less developed and range without recharging was more limited. So called “range anxiety” is still however a determining factor, a psychological barrier for many consumers especially as far as “pure” electric vehicles are concerned. This element of the e-mobility formula was something which pre-occupied all EVUE partners, with for example both Beja and Oslo focusing their Local Action Plans on the question of providing new and additional charging infrastructure. Research suggests that the majority of EV owners rely on home charging, even in many cases using regular electric sockets. This confirms the initial marginal position of EVs in the mobility mix and the users profile, predominantly purchased as “city cars” or family second cars – a feature which is also gladly seized upon to frame the sales strategies of many vehicle suppliers. However with at least charging point technology and modalities broadly in place and developing relatively rapidly (safe connectors, variety of standard, high functionality and rapid charging units, range extender and regenerative braking systems, open and restricted access systems, grid load management and smart grid capabilities...) the situation is both dynamic and at the same time static. It is obvious that home charging is neither the most adapted or secure solution to accommodate any mass shift to electric vehicles especially in dense urban areas with limited dedicated parking, or in terms of serving high-use vehicles where need for distance and rapid charging facility becomes an essential issue. In most countries and cities the level of alternative charging points remains low (on street or parking facility public charging points, shopping centres, office parking...private provision), surely insufficient in terms of generating consumer confidence and stimulating mainstream EV demand. While initial hesitation or reluctance to act as provider of charging facilities was probably primarily motivated by concern about return on investment, this was fairly rapidly compounded by the effect of uncertainty regarding questions of standards and advances in electric vehicle technology. The range and performance characteristics of vehicles like the Tesla Model S, but also other technical advances, raise relevant and urgent questions about the critical mass in respect of charging infrastructure. Conclusions in the EVUE final report also speculated for example “that the need for fast charging units in urban locations may prove to be quite limited”. This also means that the infrastructure question is far from closed and that a number of issues require further clarification if not resolution 
CONCLUSION.
In February of this year Porsche announced its return to compete in the historic Le Mans 24 hour race with the Porsche 919 Hybrid sports car. While motor sport may not be the most preferred benchmark against which to measure progress on e-mobility this is an important indication of real changes in attitude. Norway “the best pupil in the class” expects to reach a figure of 50,000 electric vehicle registrations perhaps even next year. So the conclusion on the one hand has to be that things are moving in the right direction. Owing to budget constraints London revised its 2,500 target for charging point installation (2013) downwards to 1,300. Today studies show the figure to be 1,400 which may not be too disappointing, but equally it has been estimated that only 27% of this provision is effectively being used at this point in time due to inappropriate placement. Katowice has one solitary EV in the city vehicle fleet. If e-mobility is to play its expected role in eliminating fossil fuel driven vehicles in urban areas, even by the proposed date of 2050, EVUE partners are better equipped than most to know that there is still much work to be done. Legislation at EU but also National level has been instrumental in moving psychological, behavioural and operational barriers. Even over the EVUE project period change is tangible, but delivery at the local level - to see electric vehicles as a normal part of the streetscape - is critical and requires continuing cooperation to create the optimal conditions within which effective actions can be implemented. 
There is a contradiction between the role of cities pioneering local solutions to drive e-mobility where much transport in Europe today is by definition international - and therefore standardisation (facilities, access and payment) in this market segment is a prime support mechanism.  
Technological innovation means that decisions on charging methods (both by consumers and providers) need to be seen within the context of this dynamic. There is a real need to analyse existing or potential demand in order to determine critical mass both in terms of provision levels to be foreseen but also in respect of determining incentive windows (period of offering free charging, for example). 
 In view of optimising the use of renewable energy and maximising energy efficiency from traditional fuel sources on the upstream supply side, charging technology is an important component to exploit in grid load management and smart grid applications. 

2.5. Awareness Raising.
In a sense the EVUE project in itself has been, and is very much about awareness raising – the exchange and learning platform as a thematic showcase informing partner city stakeholders, a chance to explore and separate myth from reality. Business and procurement models, decisions on charging infrastructure, take-up of electric vehicles can only be activated if there is an acceptance among stakeholders with both power and influence. Electric vehicle technology is not a new phenomenon but has always been subsumed by the dominance of other developments which have shaped the automotive industry, notably the previously unchallengeable position of the internal combustion engine. The EVUE final report reminds us that the current “revival of electro-mobility is not driven by the automotive industry but by environmental and energy policies which support e-mobility as a form of sustainable mobility”. This shows that awareness has a multi-faceted dimension, involving moving target groups who are capable of changing position over time and in response to circumstances (policy makers, vehicle manufacturers, consumers and endusers...). Overcoming ingrained habits, mindsets and prejudices is generally difficult but particularly so when it concerns individual mobility decisions; but “seeing the light” can be influenced by education, publicity and marketing but also by regulation and offering of incentives. In the 1990s and even into the beginning of this century, vehicle manufacturers were not overly convinced that change in vehicle propulsion mode was necessary or in their interests, although there were tentative moves introducing new vehicle types. It was only the development and introduction of EU legislation limiting exhaust-pipe emissions which ultimately provoked a fairly dramatic change in manufacturing, which has led to the variety of electric vehicles now on the market. However while supply is now beginning to meet consumer need this is not in itself immediately sufficient to radically change consumer behaviour. There are still big issues to bridge, not least the fact that a petrol/diesel powered vehicle can travel for six-eight hours and be refuelled almost immediately. EVUE emphasised the need for politicians and citizens to change mindsets if there is to be a structural shift in the position of electric vehicles in the mobility mix. An EV Readiness Index was developed by EVUE partners to incorporate the views of local stakeholders within the local project sphere. While there is adequate factual knowledge available, the reasons for e-mobility (environmental, policy/legislation development) and balanced assessment of the benefits (short and long term) need to be presented and accepted in order to counter misconceptions in relation to daily mobility needs (trip lengths) and vehicle performance for example. Therefore while considerable progress (with many cities leading on this) has been made in demonstrating and putting e-mobility on the agenda, there are still relatively few electric vehicles travelling our streets on a pan-European scale. It is therefore essential to keep awareness raising on the agenda and even intensify the pressure, in line with importance directed at “changing mindsets” emphasised in the URBACT work stream reflections. 
Awareness raising is an ongoing priority which requires many techniques such as education, demonstration, publicity, marketing... to continue to make the case and convince still sceptical target groups (politicians and local authorities, service providers, general public and especially young people) – so that electric vehicles can be regarded “rather as a symbol for responsible decisions and sustainability” but also corporate and private “cool”.

"FIN-URB-ACT Integrated urban actions for fostering and financing innovative economies and SMEs.  
INTRODUCTION: IMPROVING FINANCIAL AND NON-FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO LOCAL SMES 
Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) form the backbone of the economy in many European cities. Especially in former industrialised regions suffering from structural changes and transformation, where big enterprises had to close down and SMEs and startups are considered as main motors for generating employment and growth. In the last years cities started more and more activities to support their SMEs. One simple reason is that for starting up and growing their business, SMEs and innovative enterprises need a supportive environment at local level. There are already more or less extensive financial and non-financial business support services existing at higher levels. But quite often cities observe that the given offers are not well adapted to the needs and requirements of their local business community and cannot be used easily. This applies in particular for micro and small businesses and start ups. But taking action does not mean to provide all SME support services by the municipality alone. On the contrary, cities should rather encourage other local or even regional actors to offer more targeted support. Moreover, they should link and coordinate these different economic support organisations and their activities. Thus, one crucial task is to set up broad partnerships including all relevant key actors – might they be public like the relevant departments of the city administration, chambers and universities or private like development agencies, consultancies, SME associations or local financial institutions. Of course, such SME support actors are already active in most European cities and some cities were even successful in creating partnership structures. However, coordinated SME support structures are far from being ‘mainstream’ in all European cities. Even most existing networks still need to be improved. Financial support for SMEs, a crucial element in the SME support structure, is affected by strong changes. Because of tight public budgets, the financial possibilities open to the public sector for supporting the local economy will diminish in future. This creates the need for new policy developments – especially promoted by the EU. Besides the traditional grants relatively new non-grant/revolving instruments such as micro credits, loans, guarantees, convertible instruments and risk capital are increasingly applied. This goes along with the conviction that long-term sustainable SME development needs more market oriented support. Grants in comparison with risk capital show the strong weakness and risk of arbitrage effects and laziness, while risk capital shows the advantage that entrepreneurs carefully review their activities and have to work efficiently to repay the offered financial contribution. Therefore, risk capital is the more cost effective and sustainable instrument compared to traditional grants. Most SME policies and funding sources are organised on upper administrational levels namely the regional, national and European level (e.g. funding schemes financed from EU Structural Funds). Therefore, many opportunities for financial and non-financial support exist outside the direct access of cities. Unfortunately, these policies and funding sources are often not well connected to local economic development policies. They concentrate on general financial and economic logics, without taking into account specific local economic contexts, potentials and existing local support structures. The challenge of cities is to elaborate concepts on how to make best use of existing support instruments and to adapt them to the needs and potentials of their local enterprises. 
FIN-URB-ACT PARTNERSHIP 
FIN-URB-ACT brings together cities from all over Europe. The partner cities share the interest and commitment to increase their efforts in supporting their local SMEs. This is mainly based on the fact that all cities have detected several common challenges and difficulties they want to overcome with future activities. The cities have a common background: Most of them experienced quite severe structural changes and transformation processes in the past decades. They are now seeking to transform their traditional old industrialised economic structure into new, innovative growth branches, like creative industries, media and ICT, life sciences, advanced business related services, electronics or mechanical engineering. All cities have important university or other academic institutes as well as research and technology institutions and strive for a better connection between academic and R&D and the business development. FIN-URB-ACT acts on two levels, with exchange of know-how and experiences on European network level and concrete activities on partner level. At local level, concrete urban networks between key actors for SME support are set up in the broadest possible way, in order to meet local needs when creating or interlinking financial and non-financial instruments. The local partnership might include the public city administration, chambers of commerce and crafts, universities, other research and training institutions, development agencies, consultancies, SME associations and local financial institutions. The involvement of local banks in the network is crucial, not only because of their existing experience with financing SMEs but also as they are the intermediaries necessary to channel and distribute EU funds, available at higher levels. The FIN-URB-ACT partner cities will also involve the Managing Authorities responsible for distributing the Structural Funds. They will jointly discuss how the financial sources available for SME support can be better triggered down to local enterprises. Altogether the partners at local level elaborate tailor made strategies and instruments to improve the support structures for their local SMEs and especially to ease access to finance. The experiences will be brought back to the European discussions. At European level the FIN-URB-ACT partners will gather, compare and reflect the experiences in order to develop common best-practice proposals and recommendations for financial and non-financial SME support structures and instruments. The project will elaborate guidelines and recommendations on how to foster SME support. 
FIN-URB-ACT’S FOUR MAIN THEMES 
Support to small scale enterprises 
Traditionally, Cities were not heavily involved in supporting their small business community and did not consider these activities as one of their regular competences. However, today, cities find themselves in a front line position because: There is a need to provide jobs and enhance prosperity for citizens and businesses are the only actors being able to achieve these goals, Small businesses orient themselves rather towards the local level than to regional or national levels, Some sectors of activity or types of projects/ businesses (social projects, self-employment, micro-businesses) are not fully covered by private financing because of the high risks involved or the limited profitability. Cities are urged to take support action, but at the same time, they lack information on the real needs of the SMEs and the existing support instruments. Consequently, the partner cities will conduct two surveys: A map of all public support schemes, implemented at all administrative levels and available for SMEs located on their territory. A survey on the requirements of target businesses on which the cities intend to concentrate their efforts. These surveys, involving all locally active partners, will facilitate appropriation and consolidate local partnership. They will be the basis for: An analysis of the relevance of existing instruments, A discussion with private stakeholders (banks, venture capital, business angels, philanthropists, donor funds etc.,), who are/ should be the main source of funding for businesses, A re-definition of public instruments taking into account the possibilities offered by the private sector. These discussions will be conducted at network (FIN-URB-ACT) level and in the local support groups simultaneously. 
Support to innovative and high-tech businesses 
All cities have an increasing interest in having a strong technology-based economic development. High growth potential, a link with the economy of the future, attractive activities and jobs and the positive image are advantages which no city can afford to miss. Many financial instruments have been developed for these types of businesses, but numerous factors play an important role and financial instruments are only one part of them. This explains the complexity of the local support systems and the large number of specialised support organisations. Theoretically, the cities have the possibility to intervene at each stage of the process. But it is not the vocation of a public local authority to be involved in private business management, especially in high risk ventures with minority interests. In practice, the cities are interested in supporting these projects (and businesses) to allow them to grow, create jobs and wealth and to keep them on their city or region. After presenting the situation in each city, the work group “support to innovative and high-tech businesses” will focus on the structure of the numerous stakeholders that intervene on the support for innovative projects. By paying particular attention to the situation in the cities hosting the network meetings, it is not the intention to point out best examples but rather to highlight different scenarios on how to structure local keyplayers respecting specific local circumstances in order to draw the “red thread” that links those important actors. These case discussions will allow the cities to prepare a methodology on how to analyse the local situation and how to provide best support to the specialised stakeholders. 
Cities and the Managing Authorities: the pathway to partnership 
For cities, it is often unusual or even difficult to get into contact with their Managing Authorities, which are in charge of European Structural Funds – obviously it is not a spontaneous nor regular relationship. But when it comes to SME support, the SMEs consider the local level as the most adequate one. Thus, the corresponding measures need to be implemented at local level although they generally are designed at a higher administrative level. This leads to the situation where the Managing Authorities have the legitimacy of access to public finance and the cities the legitimacy of proximity to the businesses – obviously the key to success lies in combining these two legitimacies. The first issue is finding a precise definition for the Managing Authorities. A spontaneous, simple definition is the following: Managing Authority is an organisation that is in charge of the Structural Funds for the territory of the city. But in practice, the reality may be more complex, in particular in countries where the organisation of the regional level still is in process. It also applies to countries where measures concerning SMEs are managed simultaneously by the public administration and by several public or private independent organisations, in particular national agencies. This situation calls for an early clarification that the FINURB- ACT cities have planned to address. The second question is on how business support measures can be made more SME friendly. The enforcement of public procurement procedures had positive effects on a better, more transparent use of public funding, but it is not well adapted to the operational mode of SMEs. At this stage, the discussion between the Managing Authorities and the cities should be whether a “missing link” between the Managing Authorities and the SME community has not been omitted in the scenario, and whether the cities have the capacity to bring in some flexibility or, at least, contribute positively in this “missing link”. This applies to access to funding itself but also to access to expertise, which is generally required for access to funding. 
Communication 
Communication will cover two main dimensions: The type of actions directed to existing businesses and support organisations. The future of the small business community and the city image as entrepreneurial oriented. This latter aspect is related to teaching entrepreneurship in local schools and universities, including the message that becoming an entrepreneur can be a valuable option for life. Communication on supporting local SMEs. The goal of SME support is to design instruments that are actually needed and useful for businesses. Communication at local level can play a major role in increasing their visibility. Communication and information is crucial as not even the best support tool is able to work efficiently if it lacks visibility and publicity. But communication is also a difficult exercise, as SMEs require continuity and credibility mostly built on peer to- peer information. The communication process will be implemented at two levels: External level with various target groups: the business community and their representative organisations, supporting organisations and decision makers at higher level. Internal level, within the municipality departments, so that the SME dimension is considered when measures affecting the businesses are envisaged. Teaching entrepreneurship in local schools and universities Business management has long been taught in specialised schools and universities. But this form of knowledge is mainly directed to staff of large businesses and subjects on small projects and SMEs are generally on a fairly reduced scale. The cities in the FIN-URB-ACT network are interested in proceeding in two directions: Introducing entrepreneurship in the university curricula in the new Member States. Introducing entrepreneurship in secondary (and later in primary) schools.

Introduction.
This report is targeted at city authorities and other freight stakeholders who are interested in developing a set of actions
that reduce the negative impacts of urban freight transport.
The report answers the central question ‘How
can I make freight transport more effective in my
city’, based on the experiences of the 10 cities
involved in the Freight TAILS project, who asked
themselves the exact same question in 2015.
The first section outlines ‘Getting Started’ tasks.
The second section outlines ‘Taking Action’
tasks. Each task is introduced, experiences from
different Freight TAILS cities reported, and top
tips shared. Freight TAILS added value links are
made throughout the report to the key Freight
TAILS outputs: case studies highlighting specific
experiences from the Freight TAILS cities,
thematic reports on urban freight transport and
six key themes and the Freight TAILS partners’
action plans.
Finally, a set of recommended freight actions
are provided for cities to implement in order to
achieve more effective urban freight transport.

Freight TAILS
The Freight TAILS project 2015-18 has
been discovering Tailored and Innovative
Logistics Solutions (TAILS) for the
successful management of freight.
Pro-active urban freight management can
shape almost every aspect of our urban lives,
contributing to the air we breathe, noise we hear,
traffic we experience, productiveness of our cities’
businesses, quality of our surroundings, and
liveability of our neighbourhoods.
This report helps city authorities answer the
question: ‘How can I make freight transport
more effective in my city?’, by undertaking
two sets of tasks :
1. Getting Started Tasks
2. Planning Action Tasks
1. Getting Started Tasks
Take an integrated approach: Integrating
urban freight transport means taking the
economy, environment, society, politics and
local culture into account when making decisions;
and addressing urban freight transport across
a wide range of available cross-sectoral city
strategies and policies.
Work with stakeholders: Identifying and
working with a wide range of urban freight
transport and other stakeholders is essential
in designing effective urban freight management
actions.
Identify your local freight challenges: Use
face-to-face, questionnaire, or observational
surveys to gather new data; and use existing
data to identify the challenges that urban freight
transport contributes to in your city.
Set your objectives and freight goals: Based
on your freight challenges, define a series of
objectives and freight goals to provide a clear
framework to develop your actions.
Establish your plan, finance and resources:
Identify your key milestones, available and likely
finance and resources to inform your action
framework.
2. Planning Action Tasks
Define your freight actions: Develop a mixture
of different types of freight actions to help achieve
your goals and objectives including: voluntary
behaviour change, regulation & enforcement,
procurement and infrastructure-related actions.
Measure and monitor: Set a measurement
framework of realistic and collectable indicators
to monitor progress towards achieving your
freight goals.
Think about future freight: The future is here!
Consider how your city will respond to rapidly
changing technology that is changing urban
freight transport, including delivery drones,
autonomous vehicles, and Smart City initiatives.
Freight TAILS recommended city action table
provides examples of specific actions that can be
planned for your city as a result of undertaking all
the tasks above.

Managing freight transport more effectively.
Getting Started Tasks.
Take an integrated approach.
Integrating urban freight transport means taking the
economy, environment, society and local culture into
account when making decisions.
Urban freight measures should achieve positive impacts such
as improving air quality, traffic conditions, road safety and the
attractiveness of city streets.
Cities should seek to integrate the views and participation
of as wide a range of stakeholders as possible into the
development of urban freight measures to ensure maximum
success.
Authorities should address urban freight transport across
city strategy and policy documents including transport,
urban planning, economic, environment, air quality, health,
and procurement.

Work with stakeholders
There are a wide variety of stakeholders involved in urban freight transport, from both the public and private stakeholders  including local, regional and national governments, police authorities, vehicle manufacturers, purchasing businesses, fleet operators, logistics operators, environmental healthcare professionals, professional bodies,
businesses, residents and citizens.
Involving all these players in the design and development of urban
freight strategy, policy, regulations
and measures is important to
achieve sustainable change.
The position and influence of
individuals and organisations,
their availability, level of interest
and capacity to contribute are all
important factors when planning
to work with stakeholders.
The way stakeholders are involved
will differ according to the desired
outcome and the stage of planning
or delivery of freight measures.
Examples from Freight TAILS
partners:
• Parma co-designed survey
questions with their local freight
stakeholders in local meetings
• Gdynia discussed the positioning
of new delivery locations with
their local shopkeepers at local
meetings and through paper
leaflets,
• Umeå formally consulted all city
residents on their Freight Action
Plan.
Freight TAILS partners have
found the development of multistakeholder
groups a successful
way to develop freight actions.

Identify your local freight challenges.
Urban freight transport
typically contributes to
a number of challenges
within the city including:
traffic congestion, poor air
quality resulting from vehicle
emissions, road safety
concerns, lack of parking for
loading/unloading, lack of
space for logistics & logistics
sprawl, noise, and poor
liveability.
Gathering data on urban freight
transport is important to:
• help identify the challenges urban
freight transport contributes to,
• describe trends,
• help understand stakeholder
behaviour,
• test assumptions
• validate estimates.
There is a wide range of both
quantitative and qualitative data
that can be gathered under
each of these relevant headings:
analysis of logistics rules, delivery
profile, receiver profiles (shops and
residents), stakeholder analysis,
transport profile, externalities. It is
important to recognise that some
data gathered will be subjective,
based on stakeholders’ opinions,
rather than on objective facts.
Cities may find that data already
exists that can help define local
freight challenges such as road
safety statistics, but many cities will
face gaps in their knowledge, and
they will need to gather additional
data. Data gathering methods
include surveys (of establishments,
suppliers, shippers, drivers, parking),
vehicle observations, interviews,
and use of GNSS data. From base
data, modelling is also possible (and
used by Freight TAILS partner La
Rochelle) using existing systems
such as FRETURB.

Freight TAILS survey experiences.
Undertaking surveys to gather data is a good way
to demonstrate the baseline of freight activity in the
local area. Several Freight TAILS partners undertook
surveys, and their experiences are summarised
opposite.
Gathering data can lead to surprising and unexpected results,
such as these Freight TAILS examples:
• after undertaking observational surveys Gdynia discovered
that 29% of deliveries required double parking and 25%
of deliveries took place on the pavement
• after undertaking observational surveys Tallinn discovered
that up to 30 vehicles an hour were breaking the rules,
making deliveries in the historic centre outside the permitted
delivery time of 06:00 – 10:00.

Set your objectives and freight goals
Establishing the ambitions of your freight activities
by setting objectives and freight goals will provide
a clear framework in which freight actions can be
developed.
Objectives:
The objectives will be determined by the wider challenges
faced within a city, and outlined in city plans and strategies.
Freight TAILS partners identify one or more of the following
objectives for their freight activities:
To improve air quality.
To improve road safety.
To maintain and improve cities’ economic competitiveness.
To reduce traffic congestion.
To improve shared urban space.

Freight Goals:
Freight goals outline your ambitions more directly linked
to freight activities and will typically include:
• Consolidate the number of road freight vehicles.
• Use land use planning to control future activity.
• Ensure the delivery /collection time suits recipients, road
network and citizens.
• Ensure the delivery /collection location suits recipients, road
network and citizens.
• Ensure the delivery /collection route suits the road network
and other road users.
• Maximise the use of cleaner, low emission vehicles.
These can be developed in multi-stakeholder groups, although
developing them together may generate a lot of discussion
both with internal and external stakeholders.

Establish your plan, finance and resources.
Planning.
Detailed planning of your freight activities will help
you work out what is possible, by when, within
your available budget. Planning your activities
over future years will allow you to identify key
milestones and review points.
Finance.
Given the type of city objectives that freight
actions are typically designed to address
(improving air quality, reducing traffic congestion,
improving road safety and so on), there are
a number of sources of funding that may be
accessible to cities including European funding
from ERDF and / or ESF programmes and
other urban initiatives; national and regional
stakeholders; and local public and private sector
stakeholders.
Many of these city objectives stem from freight
traffic being in the wrong place at the wrong time.
Sharing city objectives with the freight industry,
and understanding how and why the industry
behave as they do, can lead to voluntary changes
in behaviour, meaning that city solutions to urban
freight management don’t need to be expensive.
Weighing up the amount of change required and
the likely budget, means that there is a tradeoff
to be made between the amount of funding
committed to a solution and the amount of
change delivered. With any limited budget it
is imperative that the focus is on achieving the
best result.
Ensure you save money by working closely with
local influencers and media who will be able to
communicate on your behalf.
Resources.
In order to develop and implement freight
initiatives city staff need to understand the freight
industry; and there should be leaders (from the
city or beyond) that are knowledgeable about
the industry and the stakeholders, neutral and
inspirational. Building partnerships between the
public and private sector can provide a great
resource for the development of freight initiatives.

Define your freight actions.
There are a range of well documented ‘usual’ freight
solutions that can be used to reduce the impact
of urban freight transport including safe vehicles,
electric vehicle charging points, consolidation
centres, cargo bikes etc.
Each of the freight solutios can be categorised according
to whether it is an infrastructure action, voluntary behaviour
change action, regulation & enforcement action, or
procurement action. Each type of action has
a different set of typical characteristics as described on the
next page.
Costs and benefits need to be considered for all options. For
example, producing case studies and communicating with the
freight industry is comparatively cheap but may only deliver
small change over a long period. Alternatively, a new regulation
could deliver more change in a shorter timescale, but new road
signs may be required, and staff or technology will be needed
to enforce it.

Measure and monitor.
Measure the impact of your
actions to demonstrate the
benefits of active freight
management.
Tell stakeholders how your freight
actions are making a difference to
improving air quality, reducing road
traffic accidents, making the area
more liveable, encouraging more
footfall in retail areas. In order to
do this, develop indicators for your
freight goals. Possible indicators are
shown on the next page.
Several Freight TAILS cities have

include the lack of existing

still need to move, vehicles need
to ‘park’, load and unload, and
at the moment humans still need
to be involved. Our acceptability
and interaction with these new
technologies will continue to change,
and our regulations and behaviours
will need to adapt accordingly.
Cities need to plan for the movement
of both people and goods together
and consider appropriate regulations
for connected and autonomous
vehicles. This will enable the delivery
of maximum benefits for both
residents and businesses, increasing
air quality and safety and reducing
congestion.
It is likely that the ‘fragmentation of
freight’ will continue meaning more
and more small parcels will need
to be delivered in a multitude of

likely to need to respond to changing
security requirements in our cities.

new technology to ensure benefits

"INTRODUCTION
Health care has a high value, not only as key input for a healthy work force and a high living quality for our citizens, but also as driver of economic growth. A global analysis of what makes urban dynamics work show a strong positive correlation (87%) between intellectual capital and innovation on the one side, and health, safety and security on the other side1. The benefit in embracing innovation in the health care sector at local level is manifold:_ As driver for enhancing social and technological innovation in the area, as many bio-clusters, bio-valleys and similar territorial innovation strategies already showcase at global level, triggering innovation demand at all levels (product, process, service and business models);_ It is an employment hub for skilled workers who can embrace a wide range of creativity and innovation opportunities, in-house as well as in cooperation with companies, citizens and NGOs;_ Healthier living and working conditions enhance local productivity, attract new enterprises;_ Healthier ageing is increasingly recognized as income source rather than expense (among others, as it should be compared to expenses and problems linked to non-healthy ageing threats, such as undertreated dementia).Through local leadership, governments can play a significant role in creating the preconditions for economic growth, the health sector being an intensively knowledge-based sector. This is the starting point for the 4D Cities project’s contribution to URBACT’s thematic priority ‘Cities, engines of growth and jobs’. Ideas and innovative ways in delivering healthcare services can be shared more effectively. In addition, by innovating in our healthcare sector, territorial leaders can provide better value to their citizens and territories. A wide range of strategic opportunities have already presented to those cities that recognized the economic power of the health sector rather than glancing passively at an increase of expenses. Only in Germany, the health sector and its related businesses (such as sport facilities, functional food or tenant services for senior residents) accounts for 16% of its GDP2. Local strategies supporting the creation and establishment of innovative health projects and integrated care processes are required, not only for and by local residents, but also as regards the attraction and retention of external talent and businesses. The current economic crisis is putting an important pressure on the sustainability of the healthcare sector in many countries in the EU, both for governments and for companies. However, the point of trying to increase efficiency in the health sector given the scenario of economic pitfalls is to maximise outcomes for a given level of public resources devoted to health care and to identify innovative business models. It is hence an opportunity for those products and services which increase the efficiency. As the Economist’s recentreport states, ‘The overriding concern of Europe’s healthcare sector is to findways to balance budgets and restrain spending’. With a projected 45% increase in the number of people aged 65 and over in the next 20 years, financing rising healthcare costs and access to a dignified and independent life for the aging population will be central to the political debate. Cities, health and innovation Any City cares for the provision of strategies towards healthier living conditions at urban level as well as the reduction of health inequalities. A vast number of urban networks and associations (such as the WHO’s European Healthy Cities Network or the Green Cities Europe Network) cover this common aim and share best practices. URBACT’s project ‘Building Healthy Communities’ has assessed methodologies to evaluate health components and impact in urban regeneration projects. The European Regional and Local Health Authorities Network’s(EUREGHA) main concern is to empower the regional and local health authority level to receive the best information required for the policy development in the health matters that are within the remit of their competence. A healthy workforce is another goal for any territory, as many studies have proven that for every Euro spent on medical prevention and treatment medical and absenteeism costs fall by about 2-3 times4.At public management level, in many EU countries local governments are coowners and co-managers of healthcare facilities and services as well as key promoters of innovation strategies. In such role, many local governments are facing regularly decisions related to health and innovation, including the procurement of new diagnostic equipment or the construction of new nursing homes. Additionally, in those territories where Innovation and/or Business stakeholders related to the health sector have settled, local networks and projects have emerged with the aim to render economic growth at local level, such as Bio-incubators and technology transfer networks linked to teaching hospitals and biomedicine faculties; Bio-fairs and brokerage events (held on a regular basis);Biomedical clusters and Living Labs; Health science cities and Health Innovation Hubs; Special facilities such as Simulation or Design centers. The healthcare sector constituting one of the most significant sectors in the EU economy, its high employment potential and its purchasing power are further aspects attractive to any city striving for economic growth. Potential economic restrictions or lack of investments in the sector raise concerns over the quality of care and the impacts on patients. Given such shortfalls, the EU Conference ‘Innovation in healthcare 2011’ identified in its report a need to ‘improve the system at all levels via a multi-stakeholder approach with active participation, e.g. of patients5. This is where 4D Cities provides added value. Aims and added value of the 4D Cities network Innovation strategies in the health sector should not just be limited to input factors for a healthy workforce or a higher quality of life but also for new innovation and business opportunities at local and regional level. Through 4D Cities, local practices and actions plans are put together in order to learn from each other in how far can cities promote those innovative health services and products that increase the competitiveness of their territories, benefiting not only from local stakeholders’ knowledge but from the Cities’strategic role within the healthcare and innovation system. 4D Cities has a double scope: on the one hand, it has as mission to show the potential which local governments have in promoting the uptake of those innovation practices by the healthcare sector which foster employment and economic growth. On the other hand, 4D Cities will define methods and tools for local governments to better integrate EU policies on health and innovation through local action plans and enhance the competitiveness of the sector at local level, integrating all actors related to innovation, health and social care at local level. At policy level, the current project throws a key challenge, as most EU policies related to health and innovation are not yet targeting the participation of local governments. 4D Cities wants to reverse this trend and wants to identify those local strategies that best match possible income sources for local governments, such as local taxation schemes or cost-effective integrated care schemes. Moreover, if innovation-based economies are to render more economic growth from a sector with (mostly) public coverage such as the health and social care, the institutional participation from local governments is indispensable. This is even more pressing as Europe is facing the challenge of an ageing society. Common methodology During the kick-off meeting (held in Igualada in June 2012), the five participating cities assessed their local economic and competitive development strategies with the aim to define a common methodology for the 4D Cities network, bearing in mind the variety of national and local realities and regulations, but also common interests and challenges. After reviewing some of the local interests and challenges, such as the development of technologies to respond to the Ageing society or how to improve our city environment to increase innovative health services & economic growth, the five cities analysed a common vision, agreeing upon the following common objective: Identify and showcase local health innovation strategies which promote economic growth for territories while enhancing the role of citizens as co-producers of their health. All 4D Cities partners are aware of its role as crucial interface along the governance system levels (national, regional and local) as well as along the healthcare system value chain. Based on this crucial interface, the 4D Cities common methodology strives for the delivery of innovative health services and products for its citizens and patients, through the cooperation among R&D and Innovation actors, the business and entrepreneur sector and services, the healthcare sector (public and private, local and supra-local facilities) and representatives from social communities, embracing the quadruple helix’levels of interaction:_ Healthcare-related economyand services (high-techcompanies, hospitals, social care, primary care,healthcare foundations and associations_ Innovation skills and regional smart specialization(Universities and academies, medical societies, incubators, etc.)._ Users (citizens, territories);_ Public governance.-Based on this quadruple helix as initial innovation platform, 4D Cities will place cities in the centre of the quadruple helix, in order to become a unique platform to share experiences and know-how on how key drivers such as Innovation support instruments, regional and local networking as well as policies to retain talent and skills on health and innovation enhance economic growth at local level. Such products and services shall render smart economic growth as well as a better quality of life to its territory and citizens
STATE OF THE ART
The State of the Art is structured in four sections:- EU Policies on smart health;- Local governments and health;- Involving citizens as co-producers of their health;- Skills, smart specialization and economic growth.
1. EU policies on smart health
High-quality health services are a priority issue for European citizens, companies and public administrations. All the systems and models are trying to balance limited resources with increasing quality objectives and various productivity factors that put pressure on the healthcare systems, including the following ones: Citizens’ expectations for high-quality care, Demographic changes, Increased prevalence of chronic diseases & Ageing societies, Increased mobility of citizens and patients, Rising healthcare costs. This Chapter describes key EU policies to foster the uptake of innovation policies in the public and private healthcare sector with a focus on its local impact and the role of local authorities. Yet, the globalization trend of the sector is an unstoppable trend. The unique character of health care as a social and personal good reinforces the importance of the regulatory role in the health sector. New devices and new drugs have to undergo strict safety controls before entering the market. Each country has own procedures that review each of the applications according to specific examination processes. Its successful process leads to the authorization of marketing the product in line with the required prescription and use conditions. Any device, including smart mobile applications, may require the authorization of the regulatory agencies before entering the market; medical web pages are subject to quality control standards and codes such as the HON Code. Some experts warn that regulation can become an obstacle to innovation. The product development lifecycle for pharmaceutical and other medical devices requires many quality and safety control steps, both in the UnitedStates through the FDA (see Figure 2) as well as in the EU. Due to the cost-intensive procedures, biomedical research has accommodated any new players globally, has distributed its knowledge-intensive resources widely, is awash in information, and has become increasingly costly to maintain. In 2010, health spending in the EU as a share of GDP remained the highest in the Netherlands (12%), followed by France and Germany (11.6%),the cause being partly demographic but partly linked to innovations (source:OECD health data 2012).In health care, the ability to manage complex communications with partners, providers, members and customers while adhering to governmental regulations and policy guidelines—all with pinpoint accuracy and good speed—is critical to ongoing success and competitive advantage. It is at this crossroads where local governments can take up the lead and promote those health and innovation strategies which render a positive economic and social impact in their territories. The following sections describe policy initiatives and strategies addressed to any innovation actor at EU level ready to promote health innovation, including local governments and public healthcare centres, while being aware of the regulatory obligations intrinsic to medical research and innovation.1.1. ‘Health for Growth’ programme As the EU stated in its recent proposal ‘EU Health for Growth Programme(2014-2020)’8, a new programme is required to help EU countries respond effectively to economic and demographic challenges facing their health systems and enable their citizens to stay healthy for longer. Its general objectives are to ‘work with the Member States to encourage innovation in healthcare and increase the sustainability of health systems, to improve the health of the EU citizens and protect them from cross-border health threats’. This way, the EU recognizes the need for a specific growth programme on health as well as the relevance of innovation support policies to such aim. The Health for Growth Programme aims to support and complement the work of Member States to achieve the following four objectives: Developing innovative and sustainable health systems; Increasing access to better and safer health care for citizens; Promoting health and preventing disease; and??Protecting citizens from cross-border health threats.1.2 EIP on Active and Healthy Ageing (EIPAHA) The European Innovation Partnership (EIP) on Active and Healthy Ageing, a pilot project under Europe 2020flagship initiative Innovation Union9, aims at enhancing competitiveness in the EU and tackling societal challenges by fostering innovation and research. The ‘Active and Health AgeingPartnership’ recognises Ageing as an innovation opportunity and it targets three major areas:_ Addressing major age-prevalent chronic diseases;_ Innovation in integrated care delivery systems;_ Innovation in independent living and social inclusion. Participation in its Strategic implementation plan (Figure 3) can occur via four different ways: Invitation for Commitment, Invitation for Expression of Intent for candidate Reference Site, Marketplace for innovative ideas and Innovation support. One of the seven flagships of the Europe 2020 Strategy is the Digital Agenda for Europe. Various local and regional governments are already participating in the various vertical and horizontal strands of EIP-AHA.1.3 Redesigning e-health in Europe for 2020e-Health holds the potential to enhance quality of health care and to support patient-centered healthcare to the benefit of European citizens and economies. National e-health governance and service structures are another catalyst for innovation, as they offer attractive business opportunities to the IT service sector, share infrastructures, and facilitate access to validated information for patients. Many countries have established advisory bodies involving e.g. professional associations, patient representatives, third party payers or care providers in their e-governance structures for the e-health strategy deployment. At the 10th High Level e-Health Conference(Copenhagen, May 2012), whose theme was 'Smart Health - Better Lives', the Task Force presented their report 'Redesigning health in Europe for 2020'11. The report states that‘Europeans find themselves today on the threshold of a new era with many opportunities for radical improvements in the way healthcare is managed and received. In order to ensure the sustainability of European health care systems, there is a need to tackle considerable challenges’ Through the provision of e-health within their territories, local authorities embrace an opportunity to increase health literacy, prevent unnecessary visits, and foster health prevention in a cost-effective way, among other benefits.1.4 Other R&D trends at EU level The Ageing society is a prime driver of innovation, especially as regards the following trends: Innovative services_ Telemedicine and new e-health applications and services. The successful development of tele-health services necessitates a highlevel of trust among clinicians, health care and support practitioners,s ervice users and caregivers (such as the Dreaming tele-assistance project). This is the origin for the first draft of the European Code of Practice for Telehealth Services._ Co-morbidities: detection, holistic treatment._ Business and growth opportunities for pharmaceutical, medical devices and products sectors. Patient empowerment:_ E-health services and platforms, such as the personal health record._ Learning and communication platforms._ Open data: access for patients to data such as clinical trial results and evaluations._ New devices and application, such as ‘mhealth’ (mobile health)applications, applicable for prevention, treatment and diagnosis. Personalised medicine, new screening and therapy methods:_ Novel treatments. Innovation in material sciences, genetics, biotechnology,_ Innovative drugs (supported among others by the IMI(www.imi.europa.eu) platform_ Treatments and drugs for rare and orphan diseases ( coordinated by ORPHANET consortium www.orpha.net).._ Expansion of innovative treatments (novel medical interventions)enhance match of demand and supply, off-label and off-patent uses. Global emerging health threats & patient safety:_ Vaccines and bio-similars._ Infectious diseases._ Biobanks and open data. Virtual physiological human:_ Human enhancement technologies._ Modelling & simulating
2. Local governments and health
Fostering a culture of innovation in current healthcare systems can create cost efficient solutions that promote economic growth for European municipalities. This section of the State of the art describes examples and tools at local level to promote smart specialization strategies by and for our citizens, based onnetworking at local level among citizens, cities, regions and stakeholders. Local governments are relevant innovation actors as they are also a model to their citizens and established enterprises and organizations. In its assessment on innovation in cities , EUROCITIES distinguishes three different types of innovation at municipal level:_ ‘Market innovation’ refers to the development of products and services to improve economic performance – be it productivity, profit, employment or GDP growth;_ Public innovation, comprising public sector efficiency and cost effectiveness;_ Social innovation, understood as the development and implementation of new ideas to meet social needs.2.1. Tax-based revenue schemes It would reach beyond the purpose of the current state of the art to describe in detail existing healthcare systems with its specific costing policies and reimbursement ratios (such as Diagnostic Related Groups - DRG), ownership provisions and liabilities, among others. Overall, the role of local administrations in EU healthcare systems varies quite significantly: in many EU countries, local administrations co-own health facilities, offering the required liability to employment and works provisions at local level15. Regional or local taxes are the main source of revenue for health care in Bulgaria, Denmark, Finland, Norway, Sweden, Spain and Italy16. In those EU countries in which taxes for health and social care spending are managed directly by municipalities or via local trusts (such as England or Finland), local authorities can more easily increase revenues by means of personal income taxation. Recently, however, the discussion has evolved from questions about capital ownership of provider institutions into a more pragmatic consideration of what model can best meet the day-to-day healthcare needs of the citizenry while promoting economic growth at local level. Non-tax revenue strategies such as pay for lease schemes or public-private partnerships (PPP) are other tools to increase the revenues at local level.2.2. Public-private partnerships (PPP)A number of non-tax revenue schemes, mainly through PPPs, are evolving as potential innovation and revenue source for cities in the healthcare sector at global level, ranging from the co-ownership in companies and facilities, through seeking capital risk and foreign investment. Local governments are taking benefit from its regional specialization efforts and needs, to support capital attraction projects. Various regions and cities work already work on enhancing the local tax levied on economic activity through capitalizing such local knowledge; examples are the ‘Health Capital’ region of Berlin-Brandenburg(www.healthcapital.de) or the City of Leeds’ ‘Innovation Capital Programme’(see Partner Profile).The challenge for the 4D Cities project is to validate local strategies that best match possible income sources for local governments within their national health system needs and challenges, based on a consensus among public stakeholders from those territorial levels involved in the healthcare services of their territories.2.3. Hospitals and local authorities Many players at local level can be mobilised towards promoting economic growth at local level through health innovation. The WHO’s study ‘Investing in Hospitals of the future’17 recognises the relevant role of hospitals as innovation poles and the role of local and regional authorities in supporting such innovation strategies. The study identifies the need to invest into health workforce, enhance the interconnection of hospitals and better interaction with patients. To illustrate this linkage, the Swedish consultancy PIEP has developed an innovation process which starts from assessing the healthcare centre’s daily processes (Fig. 4), reaching out to the municipality and the county administrations. FIGURE 4: INNOVATION PROCESS PLANNING IN HOSPITALS(SOURCE: WWW.PIEP.SE)2.4. Innovative procurement Once a local competitiveness strategy on health is set up, one important instrument for fostering innovation is innovative procurement. The procurement market can reach approximately 15% of EU’s GDP and account up to 20% of developing countries’ GDP. Such considerable percentage determines a strong purchasing power that can be driven towards innovation and the creation of value. A recent example of a municipal tendering process which included a wide participation of stakeholders is London’s collaborative procurement methodology, tried out for antiretroviral drug treatment20: as part of the Quality Innovation Productivity and Prevention agenda, HIV clinicians, commissioners and patient representatives reviewed the submitted tenders in the context of evidence and existing treatment guidelines, taking account of toxicity, tolerability and convenience. The tender resulted in guidelines for use of preferred antiretroviral drugs that deliver considerable cost reduction without negatively impacting on the likely efficacy or tolerability of treatment, as long as the guidelines were followed. For many patients, the newer guidelines represented potential improvements over their previous care, often with reduced pill burden. Various methods such as joint procurement among various local hospitals, mini-Health Technology Assessments (mini-HTA) and similar procedures are already amply used to this aim throughout Europe.2.5. Clusters and research infrastructures The general goal of any cluster is to create a competitive strategy at regional level, based on Michael Porter’s theorem of economies of scale and competitiveness, such as the case of the Medicon cluster which links Southern Sweden and East Danish regions (www.mva.org) or the ScanBalt Health region. In such biomedical clusters, research facilities and innovation services are aggregated, improving its economies of scale. Many companies also settle in such spaces, since they find the necessary innovation environment that promotes creativity and growth. The URBACT project REDIS has elaborated on this tendency of creating knowledge hubs at city level. This is how biovalleys are emerging throughout Europe: by now, there are more than 60 bioincubators and biovalleys distributed in Europe21, coordinated at EU level through networks such as ESFRI. An example are the clusters developed in the framework of the EU project ‘Renewing Health’, including a cluster on Short-term follow up after hospital discharge in COPD22.Various cities participating in the 4D Cities project already account for a health and/or biomedical cluster in their area or collaborate with a cluster nearby.
3. Involving citizens as co-producers of their health
Social innovation improves the quality of life and the performance of society. The health sector having a high social impact, the early and continuous involvement of citizens and patients in the development process of many of the health innovations has proven to be of benefit to all actors (business, public sector and academic sector). Local authorities can play a major role in bringing together citizens’ representatives and making them participative of local health innovation strategies.3.1. Social innovation Social innovation in health systems is a groundbreaking trend in this direction, making citizens co-producers of their health. To respond to this challenge, the EU has launched the Social Innovation Initiative(http://www.socialinnovationeurope.eu/) and offers research funds on social innovation in health. Various tools and methods exist to promote social innovation and participatory health care plans at City level, such as the following examples show:_ Informal care is a key tool cities can promote to solve current health threats such as alcoholism or mental illnesses. Examples include the Expert Patient Programme promoted by the UK NHS23 or the Dutch ‘Alzheimer Café’, developed at City level that brings together business people, doctors, familycare givers and volunteers._ Volunteers are another cornerstone of a municipal health prevention strategy, as Italian cities have recognized, many of them coordinating local volunteer networks (e.g. Torino project Ben Essere)._ Another element which links up social innovation at community level with the business community are Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) policies. Companies certified with CSR programmes should be promoted at City level, e.g. through the preparatory training for persons to be inserted into special employment programmes for disabled and or impaired people._ Mentoring, linking ‘PUNs’ (Patient's Unmet Needs) with ‘DENs’ (Doctor'sEducational Needs), offering up skilling and tracking the improvements._ Crowdfunding, whereby private people invest into a project and in lieu of equity, funders get gifts, incentive deals, rewards and early access to products. There are not yet many examples of crowdfunding platforms promoted by Cities in European countries, as legal issues remain to be clarified, but this example from the US shows the potential: Health Rally, created by Zack Lynch, is developing a site where someone's friends and family can make contributions designed to motivate that person to make healthy changes in lifestyle (http://www.healthrally.com/)._ User-led innovation: Examples such as the Paris-based ‘Pôle decompétitivité mondial des technologies innovantes pour la santé et les nouvelles thérapies’ (http://www.medicen.org/), show that the triple helix is moving towards the quadruple helix, a new tendency in the cluster development for health being the creation of disease-related clusters, more focused on the patient’s needs and concerns than of eventual infrastructure and human capital assets in the territory. Social innovation and community mobilization is a fundamental pillar for innovative health promotion and prevention, as various projects and networks at EU level24, including the URBACT project A.G.E. The STEPS project aimed at assessing the impact of health research on civil society organisations(http://www.steps-ph.eu). Through the ERFD fund, various Local Action Plans have been funded, with a focus on social cohesion and access to health, and social innovation is also a special category of the Regiostars 2013.Cities in Scandinavia have fostered the creation of active communities where older people help each other to enhance active and healthy ageing (‘O4O’project, www.o4os.eu).Another example of citizens’empowerment is this application which gets teenagers moving. After teenagers download the Lekkerbek-app and play the game, the game data are automatically shared with an online high-score system. There, users can compare their scores and compete for awards. The Dutch Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport has launched this year the‘Social Innovation Prize’, awarded to the most innovative executable plan on medical (technical) innovations involving the patient and the healthcare facility board (www.simsible.nl). In the ‘Dementia Experience’ people without dementia can experience how those with dementia perceive the world. This training instrument aimed at volunteer caregivers and care professionals has been developed by Tilburg University and several partners25.The development of ‘open data platforms’ in the biomedical sector constitutes a paradigm shift which is underway in most countries: informed and active citizens have a greater potential in tackling health-care challenges, enabling them to care for their own health status (see Figure 5).Mass datasets have the potential to deepen our understanding of the biggest challenges, including health care. Through the policy initiative ‘Redesigning e-Health’, it is being proposed to focus on e-health and personalized care strategies. Such integration of data facilitates access for researchers and developers of medical applications for smart phone. Semantic web applications for using data more effectively or the development of health applications based on the leverage of health data and processes are only two examples of potential innovations deriving from such strategies. An example of such innovation codeveloped by a City is the ‘Distretto2facile’ application, developed by the company Tonic Mind and co-developed by the City of Torino (Italy), allowing patients to find their way more easily to medical centres in the Torino area26.Mobile health (‘mHealth’) is another irreversible and incredibly fast-developing trend with lots of innovative business opportunities and models in place (seeFig. 6). A recent PwC survey found that 59% of the consumers who use some form of mobile health technology say it has replaced visits to doctors and nurses, although the report also states that doctors and healthcare centres are not that enthusiastic about such trend. All programmes involving citizens (patients, caregivers, friends, family, tutors,etc.) have a stronger impact if the necessary health skills, knows as health literacy, are present in our communities. 
4. Smart specialization, skills and economic growth
The previous section includes case studies which require new skills and talent, both in the healthcare sector and at patient level. The relationship between higher educational attainment and living longer with improved health has been established in many countries. As the URBACT publication ‘Cities and the crisis’27states, most European cities are ‘trying to position themselves to grow and attract in as many knowledge-intensive and green “emerging” sectors as possible… …given the ageing of the EU population and growing expenditure on health care this has also included interest in medical and healthcare companies’. Policies and reflection processes such as the ‘Cities of tomorrow’ reflection process28underpin such focus: ‘Innovation will have to be fostered to support a transition towards Cities of Tomorrow… they should be diverse, cohesive and attractive cities, they should be green and healthy, and they should be places for a resilient and inclusive economy’.4.1 Jobs Rich Recovery Given the recent economic downturn, countries are looking for ways to improve the efficiency of health spending, which ground to a halt in OECD countries in 2010, accounting for 9.5% of GDP on average (OECD Health data 2012). The EU has adopted various strategies that aim at making a halt on job destruction and company decentralization towards non-EU countries. Job creation is one of the EU’s most pressing concerns as unemployment continues rising. This scenario has motivated the EU Commission to define recommendations for its Member States for coordinated action on job creation, skills and employmentpolicies29. Health is recognised in the Communication as one of the promising employment sectors, due to ageing population and an increasing demand in innovative services (i.e. higher quality requirements, rising demand for personalised care, and professional social services).4.2 Skill development and talent retention As it employs 1 in 10 of the most qualified workers in the EU, is highly labour intensive and one of the largest sectors in the EU, accounting for about 17million or 8% of all jobs in the EU, despite the economic crisis the sector continues to grow and, with an ageing population and the rising demand for healthcare, will remain a key driver for jobs with an estimated 8 million job openings between 2010-2020. Notwithstanding this potential increase, the Commission also refers to the challenges in the sector, linked to a shortage of specialised professionals in many regions, an ageing workforce and, last but not least, the increasing demand for integrating modern technologies30. The OECD’s Local Economic and Employment Development (LEED) programme has assessed in various territories the success of the local approach to economic development, identifying factors such as local production systems, social balance, development plans for skill creation and retention, and the achievement of a critical mass, among others. One of the areas with the biggest job potential for the future are health services.4.3 Regional competitiveness and health In 2009, DG Health & Consumers assessed the linkages between structural funds and health31, making a distinction between three areas of investments:_ Direct health sector investment,_ Indirect health sector investment,_ Non-health sector investment with potential health gain (see Fig. 7), an area supported by almost all ERDF, CF and ESF investment funds. On 4-5th June 2012 a two day conference was held in Krakow as part of the third “Week of Innovation in Europe” (www.wire2012.eu). One of the main sessions concerned the role of cities as “innovation hubs”. Innovation is given a central place in the EU 2020 strategy: two key strands are emerging which are highly relevant for cities, the Horizon 2020 Framework Programme for Researchand Innovation (including societal challenges) and, as second strand, the structural funds – offering support for regions in building up their research and innovation capacity through the Cohesion policy which will take forward the concept of smart specialization and include measures to allow researchers across Europe to grow into excellence. Figures 8a and 8b illustrate this linkage between territory and competitiveness.4.4 Key enabling technologies In order to focus EU policy and adapt their instruments in the next multi-annual financial framework on research and innovation, cohesion policy, and prioritise EIB lending activities, the EU has just released the European strategy for Key Enabling Technologies – A bridge to growth and jobs32 which sets out an integrating approach towards research and product development, defining KETs as ‘a key source of innovation. They provide indispensable technology bricks that enable a wide range of product applications’. Five priority areas are defined as KETs, among them biotechnology. The strategy aims to keep pace with the EU's main international competitors, restore growth in Europe and create jobs in industry, at the same time addressing today's burning societal challenges. Public-private partnerships, specific funds under Horizon 2020 and linkages to structural funds are some of the foreseen actions.

"CITY STRATEGY ON GASTRONOMY AS A TOOL FOR TOURISM END EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT.  
Cities have a crucial role in the achievement of the Europe 2020 objectives. The urban complexity with different mixture and use of resources, service policies and knowledge gives the key to a higher social cohesion and to increase economic diversity. In this framework, gastronomy and gastronomic tourism can be engine with potential to mobilise other sectors and resources, to contribute to cities' overall experience and its attractiveness. The project Gastronomic cities proposes innovative approach in developing gastronomic tourism in the cities addressing the following topics: Hospitality sector promoting entrepreneurship and SMEs development and employment as an engine for the city development. Tourism as an overall experience of the city and its life with multiplying effects on culture, commerce, urbanism, complementary services. Strategic partnership arrangements to ensure a demand driven and integrated approach, improving Innovation and knowledge economy, following Lisbon Agenda principles. Gastronomy as an urban cluster of economic activities that contribute to growth, jobs and competitiveness. Framework for local raw material producers mainly primary sector to support the development of a strong and sustainable agricultural and food industry base able to compete globally. Gastronomy as a flagship for “Innovation union to improve framework conditions and access to finance for research and innovation so as to ensure that innovative ideas can be turned into products and services that create growth and jobs.  INTRODUCTION Baseline study of Gastronomic Cities project was prepared according to given template. The study aims to give insight into gastronomy and gastronomic tourism in Europe and in some countries and to give very accurate and in depth description of Burgos gastronomic tourism model as good practice that will be subject to transfer to the partner cities. It brings description of present situation in receiving cities to see how Burgos good practice could be transferred. The study brings also methodology of transfer process and monitoring indicators to evaluate transfer efficiency. Preparation of the study was done together with project partners. The author of baseline study – lead expert visited only Burgos where he studied good practice, met participants and discussed with them Burgos gastronomic tourism model, challenges, organization, targets, activities, results, problems and got very good inputs. The study was done in a very short time. This limits the completeness and accuracy of all findings and conclusions that might affect later elaboration of feasibility studies, action plans and consequently transfer implementation itself. There was also not enough time to discuss some findings and conclusions with project partners who could contribute more to elaboration of baseline situation and to prepare better for transfer implementation.  GENERAL CONTEXT OF GASTRONOMIC TOURISM - STATE OF THE ART ANALYSIS “The European gastronomy and its related traditions and products have high potential for the consolidation of the image and profile of Europe as a sustainable and high-quality tourist destination.” stated Mr. Santander, Executive Director of the European Travel Commission (ETC).All stakeholders in the destination are becoming aware of the importance of gastronomy in order to stimulate local, regional and national economic development and to diversify tourism. It has positive impact on employment, cultural development and cooperation and contributes to improving general perception and image of the destination. Furthermore, gastronomy includes ethical and sustainable values based on local products, culture, lifestyle and landscape. Gastronomy has become an indispensable element in order to get to know the culture and lifestyle of a destination and so embodies all the traditional values associated with the new trends in tourism: respect for culture and tradition, a healthy lifestyle, authenticity, sustainability, experience…etc. This leading role of gastronomy when choosing travel destination has resulted in the growth of gastronomic offer based on high quality local products and the consolidation of a separate market for food tourism. One of the most utilized definitions of gastronomic tourism used in the literature is that proposed by Hall and Sharples (2003), according to which food tourism is an experiential trip to a gastronomic region, for recreational or entertainment purposes, which includes visits to primary and secondary producers of food, gastronomic festivals, food fairs, events, farmers’ markets, cooking shows and demonstrations, tastings of quality food products or any tourism activity related to food. In addition, this experiential journey is related to a particular lifestyle that includes experimentation, learning from different cultures, the acquisition of knowledge and understanding of the qualities or attributes related to tourism products, as well as culinary specialities produced in that region through its consumption. Thus, the experience of gastronomic tourism is considered as such, provided that everything mentioned above constitutes the main reason or motivation to travel for visitors to a particular destination or at least on significant motivation. Researchers have pointed out that culinary tourism is an authentic experience of a sophisticated lifestyle in a pleasant environment, associated with the good life and the economic well-being of consuming exclusive, high-quality locally grown products. Nowadays tourists are more experienced and informed, have more disposable income and more leisure time to travel, and thus tourism allows them to escape from the daily routine of their usual working and living environment. Therefore, more tourists are looking for concrete learning experiences in highly diverse ways. Tourists seek not only to know about the local food but also to know its origin, production process, legends and stories about the food history, making it an expression of cultural tourism1. Food has assumed a prominent role in tourist decision making and satisfaction. It can therefore, be a useful instrument to guide the destination choices of tourists as well as the general development of a particular region or area (Henderson, 2009). Alonso (2010) recognised that the growing popularity of wine and other forms of rural based tourism also underlined the importance of multifunctionality or the “multifunctional character of agriculture” in rural areas. The socioeconomic benefits of food tourism in rural areas are well-accepted (OECD, 1998; Bekefi and Varadi, 2007 cited in Alonso, 2010). The establishment of good links between tourism and agriculture is perceived to have great importance for host destinations, but also in countries that are largely agrarian or dependant on farming activities (Torres, 2003 cited in Alonso, 2010). Relationships between food and tourism or between hospitality firms and local communities represent opportunities such as the creation of employment (Andiotris, 2002 cited in Alonso, 2010). Other benefits are opportunities for rural diversification (Hall, 2004 cited in Alonso, 2010) and product development. 
2.2. Market significance and economic importance of gastronomic tourism 
2.2.1 Economic importance of gastronomic tourism 
In recent decades tourism has become one of the most important service industry in the global economy. Part of its importance lies in the wide range of services required to produce tourism products: transportation, accommodation, information, marketing, financial services, insurance, etc. The bundling of these services supports the production of tourist experiences. Food has particularly important role in the development of tourism services, since it makes up a large part of tourism expenditure - it is a necessity for all tourists in all destinations. One of the important factors stimulating the relationship between tourism and food experience is the role of these elements in local development. Both food and tourism have wide range of linkages to other areas of economy that tends to increase the value of the activities to the local economy. Gastronomic tourism is an emerging phenomenon that is being developed as a new tourism product due, inter alia, to the fact that according to the specialized literature (among others, Quan and Wang, 2004) over one third of tourist spending is devoted to food. Therefore, the cuisine of the destination is an aspect of utmost importance in the quality of the holiday experience. In general, most of the organizations included in UNWTO survey (Global Report on Food Tourism, 2012) indicated that there is still no systematic analysis of the economic impact of food tourism. However, they consider that the weight of gastronomy in tourism revenue in destinations is very significant, at around 30%, and that destinations have a large margin to work with in this respect. A variety of studies have underlined the strong impact that food experience can have on the tourism industry and the local economy. In Italy, for example, data from the Wine Tourism Observatory indicate that the average wine tourist spent almost 200 EUR per day in 2010 compared with around 150 EUR per day in 2003. The spending by wine tourists is much higher than the average spending for Italian domestic tourists as a whole, estimated as 55 EUR per day in 2012. The 5 million Italians who engage in wine tourism in their own country generate up to 5 billion EUR in 2010. (Osservatorio sul Turismo del Vino, 2011). Research by Failte Ireland (2010) indicates that 2 billion EUR was spent on food and drink by tourists in Ireland in 2009. Overseas visitors accounts for 60% of the total spending estimated at 1,2 billion EUR in 2009, while expenditure on food and drink by domestic tourists is estimated at over 700 million EUR. Food and drink represents 36% of visitors’ expenditures besides accommodation. These expenditures lead to estimation of 163.200 employees providing food services to tourists. According to a study by the University of Barcelona, more than 30% of Tourist expenditures in Barcelona go on cuisine. In 2001 tourism generated around 835 million EUR for restaurant businesses. The importance of food in the tourism economy of the city stimulated the staging of the Year of Gastronomy in 2005 – 2006, during which more than 300 activities were staged, the majority aimed at tourists. In Ontario, Canada a study showed that the food sector in the province had an annual turnover of 22,5 billion CAD and employed more than 404.000 individuals. Tourists spent almost 2 billion CAD on food and drink in 2010, with “deliberate culinary tourists” accounting for 816 million CAD, or 46% of total culinary tourist expenditures. Furthermore, some research show that food events can have an important economic effect in their own right. For example, the Charleston Wine and Food Festival in United States generated a record economic impact of 7,3 million USD on the local economy in 2011, 2 million USD more than in 2010. A study by the College of Charleston’s Business School found that the average tourist spent 764 USD in the city. Over 80% of tourists travelled to Charleston specifically for the event (Bird, 2011). 
2.2.2. Market for gastronomic tourism 
Latest findings of Eurobarometer study (EC, 2014) proves that main reasons for going on holiday in 2013 were sun and beach (46%), visiting family (34%), nature (30%) and following culture, including gastronomy, arts, etc. (25%). One of the major challenges in the experience economy is dealing with the shift towards intangible culture and heritage. The focus of many tourists has changed from the classic 'must see' physical sights such as museums and monuments towards a ‘must-experience’ imperative to consume intangible expressions of culture, such as atmosphere, creativity and lifestyle. This provides new opportunities for tourism destinations as well as new challenges, particularly in the areas of experience development, marketing and branding. López-Guzmán (2012) noted that tourism had undergone major changes during the first few years of the twenty first century as a consequence of tourists searching for new and different destinations that offered distinct and novel experiences. This led to new trends in tourism, particularly the identification of non – traditional and less crowded destinations as well as a recognition of a change in expectation and needs of tourists. Modern tourists are increasingly motivated by the search for new experiences and sensations. Traditionally, tourists wished to sightsee, observing architecture, countryside and works of art. At other times, tourists did not use their other senses enough. Tourists now demand trips where they can use their other senses. They wish to appreciate the atmosphere of a location, enjoy the local food or take part in a particular event. This is why wine and culinary tourism has emerged (López-Guzmán, 2012). Tikkanen (2007) took a different perspective and considered that a pleasant eating experience is one of our core physiological needs at all times. This view is supported by Henderson (2009) and Alonso (2010) who recognized that food and tourism share a very close relationship with access to good food, being a critical tourism resource (Quan and Wang, 2004). A region’s local foods can be a motivating factor among tourists seeking unique and authentic experiences and it is during these events that tourists are exposed to their host’s cultures (Plummer et al., 2005 cited in Alonso, 2010). Several studies have found that tourists travel to those destinations that have established a reputation as a place to experiment with quality local products. In the tourism world there are influential destinations whose brand image is connected, with varying levels of intensity, to gastronomic values. Satisfaction with the destination leads to customer loyalty and this in turn gives a higher level of intention to repeat the visit. Quality gastronomy is a decisive factor in satisfaction, as it produces a lasting memory about the experience lived by the tourist. Thus, depending on the expectations held by the consumer as to the gastronomy of the destination, such expectations predict their levels of loyalty or fidelity, leading to repeat purchase behaviour. The festive atmosphere, relaxation and fun experienced by tourists during visit of a gastronomic route, and the social interaction with people of similar interests create associations in the tourist’s mind linked to the good times experienced as tourist. Gastronomic routes are becoming without doubt one of the most developed products in this area. A gastronomic route is a system that constitutes a comprehensive and thematic tourism offer, generally branded, and is defined by one or more itineraries in a given geographic area (although in reality, gastronomy has no borders), with a series of tourism products or sites, such as factories and restaurants, which are listed in tourism guidebooks and which revolve around a specific food, product or dish, generally with differentiated quality, or gastronomic events or activities. The route also informs about other sites of historical interest, thus promoting economic development throughout the area. Therefore, the idea is to bring together different types of tourist attractions and to offer them in a conveniently packaged form so that tourists stay longer in the area than if only one kind of attraction is featured. Gastronomic routes will be successful if they manage to activate gastronomic heritage and convert it into food tourism as an attraction for tourists, while at the same time differentiating it from the competition as visitors look for variety, new sensations and authentic experiences. But, any creation or value proposition made to strengthen travel motivations focused on gastronomy should be underpinned by sustainability principles and practices and organized around an effective system of public-private cooperation. Both approaches are inseparable and can provide benefits not only to direct providers, such as restaurants and food industries, but also to other sectors indirectly related but linked to tourism, creating conditions for improving local employment and the promotion of new activities in zones of influence. Food is an essential prerequisite that all tourists eat when travelling and for some good food can be a major draw and primary motivator (Henderson, 2009). With regard to benefits, food offers pleasure and entertainment and serves a social purpose. Dining habits can also afford insights into ways of life (Bell and Valentine, 1997, in Henderson, 2009), helping tourists understand differences between cultures (Hegarty and O’Mahoney, 2001; Williams, 1997 in Henderson, 2009). Henderson (2009) suggested that food tourism could be a core element in the branding of a country or a destination by marketers. A clearly defined gastronomic identity and heritage could be exploited in crucial processes of differentiation and rejuvenation, helping to convey a unique sense of place. Food can thus be central in destination development and harnessed to overall economic advancement. Food had become recognized as: A part of the local culture, which tourists consume; A part of tourist promotion; A potential component of local agricultural and economic development; A regional factor that is affected by the consumption patterns and perceived preferences of the tourists (Hall and Mitchel, 2001; Misiura, 2006 in Tikkanen, 2007). Tikkanen (2007) has identified five approaches to food that can influence motivation for a visit: Food as tourist attraction (Hjalager and Richards, 2002) with particular emphasis on tourism to well developed Western destinations. Foodstuffs as a tourist product component (contributing to the overall experience) which has multiple factors influencing the food volume and consumption structure (Meler and Cerovi, 2003). Food experience in tourism. Quan and Wang (2004) introduced this as a two dimensional model, where the tourist experience refers to the key attractions that constitute the major motivation for tourism. For a tourist consumer, satisfaction of nutritional needs is not a mere act but increasingly a culinary – gastronomic experience (Meler and Cerovi, 2003). The role of food in culture (e.g Quan and Wang, 2004) where food consumption is regarded as one of the most important factors in the destination and is key in marketing of that destination. Linkages between tourism and food production. 
2.2.3 Food Tourism: tourists’perspectives 
Understanding consumer perspectives in food and tourism is critical for leveraging the greatest benefit for destinations. It is widely recognized that tourists provide significant proportion of the market to restaurants and cafes around the world. However, there are substantial differences in the profiles of food-interested tourists between regions, even in the same country, and even at different times of the year. As pointed out by Mitchell et al. (2000) in relation to wine tourism, “profiles of wine tourists in one region should not be automatically assumed to the same in another, or even from one winery to another”. One of the problems in understanding food tourism and the potential economic contribution of the food and tourism to regional economies in the multitude of definitions and their use. Hall and Sharples(2003) emphasized that in defining food tourist there is a real need to differentiate between tourists who consume food as a part of the travel experience and those tourists whose activities, behavior and even destination selection is influenced by interest in food. Wine tourism has been defined as visits to vineyards, wineries, wine festivals and wine shows. Whereby grape wine tasting and for experiencing the attributes of a grape wine region are the prime motivating factors for visitors (Hall, 1996). Food tourism may be defined as visits to primary and secondary food producers, food festivals, restaurants and specific locations for which tasting is the primary motivating factor for travel (Hall & Mitchell, 2001). Additional to tourists who have an explicit interest in cuisine, there are a far large number of to tourists who still have to eat. These visitors are economically significant not only by virtue of their direct purchasing of food when at a destination, but also the extended effect they have on the wider local food supply chain. Mitchell and Hall (2003) have identified market segments on the basis of the level of interest and involvement of visitors in local food and cuisine at destinations. Some tourists have a serious or special interest and like to take part in organized activities such as sampling or learning about food and often incorporate an appreciation of beverages, both alcoholic and non-alcoholic (Hall et al, 2003 cited in Henderson, 2009). Other tourists although having a more casual attitude to food, must still decide upon what and where to eat when away from home. Dining out and trying national and local cuisine are agreeable pastimes on holiday and a diversion for some travelers. Many tourists enjoy watching the scenes at outdoor and indoor markets as traders and customers go about their everyday business. Those on self-catering may also buy ingredients and cook their own meals, as well as patronize commercial establishments. Special product, especially if closely linked to the destination, is a popular souvenir and useful gift. Consumption patterns may even change on the traveler’s return as a consequence of exposure to previously unknown foodstuff and methods of preparation (Henderson, 2009). The purpose of the Food Tourist Study (who are they, what do they want, how do you package offers, and reach them?) was to identify the different dimensions of being a ‘foodie’, what ‘foodies’ want and need from food and travel experiences, how ‘foodies’ communicate, and their travel patterns and preferences related to food. The ultimate use of this market intelligence is to attract more high- yield food tourists through development of attractive experiences and more targeted marketing and communications. 
2.2.4. Food tourism: advantages and benefits for food producers 
Gastronomy forms a part of the social, cultural, economic and environmental history of areas and their residents. It reflects the specific way of life in different geographical areas, underpinning tradition in rural areas and modernity in urban ones as the cuisine is rooted in its own culture and traditions. Local and regional food could give added value to the destination and contribute to the competitiveness of the area. The advantages for the food producer in developing food tourism are (Hall & Sharples, 2003, 2008; Hall, 2005a): Increased consumer exposure to product (including opportunities for product sampling); Brand awareness and loyalty developed through establishing links between branded merchandise and consumer; Positive costumers relationship created with opportunities to meet staff and to see “behind the scenes”; Increased sales margin through direct sale to consumers; Additional sales outlet(s); Product marketing intelligence derived from direct customer feedback; Customer marketing intelligence and the possible development of a customer database; Educational opportunities to create awareness and appreciation of specific types of food. 2.2.5 Global trends in food tourism Growth of food tourism worldwide is an obvious fact. It is one of the most dynamic segments within the tourism market. Food tourism is formed by tourists who take part in the new trends of cultural consumption. They are travelers seeking the authenticity of places they visit through food. They are concerned about the origin of products. They recognize the value of gastronomy as a means of socializing, as a space for sharing life with others, for exchanging experiences. Such tourists have higher-than- average expenditures, they are demanding and appreciative, and they eschew uniformity. Therefore, gastronomy cannot become a bland and anonymous product; it must have personality, because otherwise it will become vulnerable, delocalized and subject to adulteration. The territory is the backbone of gastronomic offerings. The territory is an element that differentiates and is the source of local identity. It encompasses environmental and landscape values, history, culture, tradition, the countryside, the sea, the own cuisine of the place. In this regard, the conversion of the territory into a culinary landscape is one of the challenges of tourism destinations. The product is the basis of Food Tourism. Therefore, it is important to define what cultural resources and natural resources stakeholders are going to convert into tourism products that make it possible to identify a certain territory. Culture is the set of behaviors, knowledge and customs that shape a society and on which a sense of belonging is based. The design of any food tourism offering will not be viable if it does not take into account the cultural characteristics of the territory. Gastronomy allows tourists to access the cultural and historical heritage of destinations through tasting, experiencing and purchasing. That means, it makes it possible to approach culture in a more experiential and participatory way that is not purely contemplative. Food tourism is capable of addressing cultural and environmental concerns in a way that is compatible with purely economic arguments. The recent history of global tourism development is littered with nominally sustainable models and manifestly unsustainable actions. The idea is not to create new indiscriminate pressure on culinary heritage, but to leverage it rationally with an eye to sustainability. It is not about “touristifying” gastronomy, by creating new offers or scaling up existing ones. It is not so much about creating in order to attract, but rather attracting visitors to participate in the destination’s own cultural reality, well explained and interpreted, through cuisine, local products and all the services and activities that surround them. Destinations that want to promote food tourism have to work on various levels in the field of quality: protection and recognition of local products, the development of a competitive offer, the professionalism of human resources throughout the value chain of food tourism through training and retraining, and consumer protection in order to increase visitor satisfaction. Destinations must articulate a credible and authentic story of their food tourism offer. The travel experience has changed and is not limited to the days of actual travelling, but it starts much earlier with preparations (the tourist becomes inspired, gathers information, compares, decides, purchases), and the experience ends when the traveller assesses and shares his experiences through social networks. Key roles in the process have the great chefs who have ignited a revolution in the segment of high-end cuisine as a revitalizing element for tourism, the media (especially television), tourist guides, food blogs and social networks in the image building of a destination. And destinations must be present in all channels and all parts of this process. It is necessary for the actors operating in the destination (producers, farmers, ranches, fishermen, chefs, restaurateurs, public administrations, hoteliers, etc.) to be involved in the definition and management of food tourism product offer.   
CONCLUSION.  
Baseline study of Gastronomic project gives the general overview of development of gastronomy in several countries and on international, global or European level. All the documents, case studies show the growing importance of gastronomy and gastronomic tourism (also called food tourism). Gastronomic tourism is a trend, is a fashion, is experience that combines reinventing traditional cuisine, search for new delights, new tastes, using adopted and new raw materials – mainly agricultural and food products and new technology. Creativity of chefs – gastronomic gods does not know the limits. Culinary art is becoming an art as shown in the movie – El Somni. Gastronomic cities project partners are coming from different countries with different tradition and recognition of gastronomy. Spain and Italy are leaders, not far behind is Greece and newcomer is Romania. The project is based on good practice of Burgos, where gastronomy was set as a pillar for tourism and economic development. The Burgos project shows that development of gastronomy is very complex and it demands multi-stakeholder cooperation, the work of many individuals and small businesses, volunteer work and good management. Baseline study compiled Burgos gastronomy development, challenges, targets, activities and results in a model that can serve as benchmark for transfer to receiving cities. The project also demonstrates that gastronomy development does not need big investment and new or additional known economic or social policies. Gastronomy is all around us, is present in everyday life, is easy to understand. Agriculture and food production is close to urban centers and can play important role in supplying restaurants with their products and play important role in promotion of development of rural areas. Development of gastronomy bring results on short term and without big financial investment. Baseline study identifies the situation of receiving cities: Fermo (IT), Korydallos (GR), Alba Iulia (RO) and L’Hospitalet de llobregat (ES) to estimate to what extent the cities can transfer Burgos good practice and what adoptions and activities are needed for that. This section of the study seems to be just an initial phase of detailed analysis of the situation in receiving cities. There is a need for more profound information and knowledge about these cities which will be fulfilled during the preparation of feasibility studies of transfer of Burgos good practice. At the end is a model for monitoring and evaluation of project performance and project results. Project impact and results are very limited due to short duration of the project. Still, regular monitoring and external evaluation should support efficient project implementation towards planned results.

"  GEN-Y CITY  
Developing, attracting & retaining Gen-Y ‘creative-tech’ talent in European cities.  
1.0 Definition of the main policy challenge to be addressed   
The main objective of the GEN-Y CITY Network is to achieve smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, by establishing stronger forms of co-operation between science, local government, businesses and residents to improve the development, attraction and retention of Gen-Y ‘Creative-Tech’ talent (particularly Creative-Tech entrepreneurs) in European cities.   One of the major challenges currently facing many high-technology firms is how best to win ‘the war on tech-talent’. According to Business Europe ""the lack of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) skilled labour will be one of the main obstacles to economic growth in the coming years1”.  1.2 Demand for people with STEM skills is increasing across the Globe. Many STEM workers are approaching retirement age. Some forecasts suggest around 7milliontechnical job openings will emerge between 2016 and 20252.Whilst demand for technical people continues to increase, the number of people choosing to pursue technical careers continues to fall. Whilst the share of STEM University graduates has increased in 15 Member States and at European level since the mid-2000s, the number of STEM Technicians has decreased over the same period. Skills shortages are particularly acute in Engineering and Information Technology sectors and for professionals. Because of these issues, the unemployment rate for STEM skilled labour across Europe has been very low and well below the total unemployment rate since the beginning of the 2000s, even in countries hit particularly badly by the crisis (such as Greece, Portugal and Spain).  1.3 The main reasons why too few young people are pursuing technical careers is because they generally consider jobs in these industries as unattractive, too regimented and insufficiently creative and/or flexible. In addition, because social media has given young people a global perspective on life - and because many of them aspire for immediate and intense life experiences, many of them think nothing of jumping on a plane to pursue a particular career or work opportunity. That said, short-term contracts, changing working conditions, uncertainty and low pay are combining to extend many young people’s pathway into adulthood3.  1.4 These issues, combined with the economic crisis, has increased intra-country and intra-European talent mobility, with Europe’s population generally migrating from smaller to larger cities and from Southern & Eastern Europe to North West Europe.  1.5 Cities across the globe are now under increasing pressure from global talent flows and the ‘pull’ of more glamorous cities. Whilst authors like Michael Porter4 have long argued that a few characteristics of cities and regions (like the availability of labour, the knowledge base, land availability, raw materials, size of the population, local culture etc.) can provide locations with a source of competitive advantage, recent developments have made the whole process of attracting global talent even more difficult.  1.6 In addition, the trend towards lifestyle migration (where more and more people are making location decisions based on lifestyle preferences and flexible working arrangements) is also driving the attractiveness of different cities amongst Europe’s young creatives.  1.7 Those cities that are successful at developing, attracting and retaining the best ‘creative-tech’ talent will be more successful in developing, stimulating and attracting high-value firms than those that don’t. If cities genuinely aspire to attract high value tech businesses of the future, they need to think very carefully about what kind of places these young creative-tech people want to live in and make sure their cities develop accordingly.  1.8 In response to these issues, many municipalities need to find new ways of working with these new, so called, ‘micro multi-nationals’ and ‘digital nomads’. Cities need to promote flexible working arrangements, and find ways to work with these young talents in such a way which allows them to build their careers ‘horizontally’, whilst working as freelancers or for several employers at the time or employed on temporary contracts.   Collectively, these changes could have profound effects not only on the world of business, but could also further impact on migration patterns across Europe and affect the vibrancy of inner cities. Cities that want to attract creative-tech talent, micro-multi-national and digital nomads will need to be globally connected, both through physical and virtual infrastructure but also in their mind-set.  1.10 In response to these issues, the disciplines of skills development, urban growth, talent retention and foreign direct investment are likely to converge, so that recruiting a new employee becomes more like attracting an individual with entrepreneurial drive or attracting an investor. The locations that manage to do this will get a head start in the global game of attracting and retaining talent.  1.11 In light of these issues, ALL the cities of Europe need to develop new and adapted policies, approaches and solutions to develop, retain and attract young creative-tech talent (particularly young ‘creative-tech’ entrepreneurs) if they are to remain prosperous and vibrant cities. The situation is particularly acute in many of the smaller, less well developed, transition and peripheral cities of Europe.  1.12 In addition, many of the cities with weaker ‘capacities’ will need to improve the integration of different urban policies, and develop new, shared governance models to address particular challenges if the solutions they come up with are going to be viable and/or affect the scale of change needed to establish a business environment/quality of life that appeals to young people.   
2.0 Setting the scene: Understanding the context  
2.1 Whilst it’s universally accepted that young people can play a significant role in helping to shape the future competitiveness of Europe’s cities, many authors56have also recognised that young people today find themselves in a much more challenging situation than any of the previous generations, as a series of unfortunate, unconnected events have largely come together to conspire against them, including Demographic changes; Changing social norms; Changing employment structures; Changing housing patterns; and Changing debt and inheritance patterns.  2.2 For some authors, these issues are fundamentally changing young people’s outlook and attitudes, with many young people increasingly looking for more positive, intense life experiences and emotions which deliver instant and immediate satisfaction. Some have characterised the Y Generation as having a stronger ‘you only live once’ (YOLO) outlook.  2.3 Numerous studies have also shown that young people want to develop their careers in a more flexible manner, outside the traditional work paradigms of the older generations. The Y Generation7are said to have a tendency to value flexibility over a traditional career, with some evidence suggesting more are turning to self-employment as a means to achieve this goal.  2.4 Some analysis suggests that many young people are ‘detached from the institutions’ but ‘networked with friends’. According to this research, they are highly competent in their use of the Internet and technology; they are civic-minded; and they have high expectations in terms of salary and place of work. Other authors have suggested that many young people would generally prefer to work for organisations that have a high sense of purpose, or a bigger ideal.  2.5 Generation-Y workers are now entering the labour force in large numbers and research shows that many of them wish to gain international work experience9. There is also a trend towards increasing lifestyle migration, where more and more people make their migration and moving decisions based on lifestyle preferences, rather than on economic factors.  2.6 Collectively, these issues are creating greater global competition for young talent, whether employed or self-employed. Organisations and cities now have to compete, not only against each other, but also against the start-up scene10.  Unemployment and the Y-Generation. 2.7 What the traditional labour market offers Generation-Y nowadays is changing. The current situation is characterised by changing working conditions, increasing uncertainty, short-term contracts and low salaries.  2.8 In 2014 as many as 21.9% of young people up to 25 years of age were unemployed in the EU, a much higher proportion than the population as a whole. Nine in ten cities face higher youth unemployment than general unemployment, although overall youth unemployment varies significantly, even within individual countries.  2.9 According to research by LSE Cities11, Southern states generally have the greatest difficulty integrating young adults into the labour market, although there are several examples where more advanced economies have consistently high figures.  2.10 This entire situation questions the validity of old business models and calls for new ones based on networking and new technologies and offering young people meaningful and self-defined jobs. They can be found in many young companies active in innovative and creative sectors.  2.11 At the same time, European countries and regions are seeking out new ways of enhancing their competitiveness and innovativeness in the framework of the smart specialization concept and methods to support new business models. These issues are also impacting on migration patterns across Europe.   Population shift and the future ‘war for talent’. 2.12 The current economic crisis has also increased intra-European talent mobility from southern Europe to northern Europe. An analysis of migration flows across Europe also indicates a number of important trends, namely that Europe’s population is shifting to the North-West and the draw of Europe’s big and mid-sized cities is causing many smaller, peripheral cities to shrink. Despite fertility rates that are comparable with the West, many Eastern European countries are experiencing lower population growth rates than the rest of Europe. The reasons for this are complex, but can largely be attributed to higher levels of out migration, as many residents leave their home country to pursue employment opportunities in countries that they perceive to be more attractive / affluent.  2.13 Increases in unemployment rates (particularly youth unemployment in the Southern Europe) have further contributed to out-migration as young people leave their home country to seek out better employment opportunities. In a number of Europe’s larger cities (such as London) foreign-born residents make up more than 40% of the population. By contrast, in many Eastern European cities, the foreign born population often doesn’t exceed 5%.  2.14 Because of these issues, employers around the globe are facing the challenge that, despite a growing global population, they will soon have to recruit from a shrinking workforce. This will obviously lead to greater competition for talents. As a result, attracting talents from one’s own country, or even other European countries, will increasingly become a zero-sum game, and talent will need to be attracted from other parts of the world. This ‘war for talent’ will become increasingly acute in sectors that require high skill levels and more education.  2.15 Talent mobility has increased 25% relative to the previous decade, and is predicted to increase by 50% by 2020.Looking further forward, a study conducted by Oxford Econometrics12has found that many cities across Europe are forecast to be suffering from a talent deficit by 2021, with many likely to need to recruit from countries such as India, Indonesia, Colombia, South Africa and Brazil – all of whom were likely to be experiencing a talent surplus.  2.16 This same study also forecasts that the most dramatic jump in future demand for workers will be in emerging Asia, where the need for new employees will rise by 22%; closely followed by Latin America (13%); the Middle East/Africa (13%); and Eastern Europe (10%). By contrast, demand for talent in North America, is forecast to rise by 6.1% over the next 10 years and Western Europe is only projected to grow by a much more modest 3.5%. By contrast, the same report suggests the greatest mismatches between supply and demand for talent in Europe in 2021 are likely to be found in various countries (including Spain, Switzerland, Austria, Netherlands, Sweden, Norway, Germany, France, the UK, Greece, Italy and Poland).  2.17 This means there is a more acute need to retain local talent in many smaller cities and more peripheral regions and attract more migrant talent to become more globally competitive.   The rise of the ‘micro-multinational’  2.18 In ‘The Rise of the Micro-Multinational: How Freelancers and Technology-Savvy Start-Ups are Driving Growth, Jobs and Innovation’13, The Lisbon Council describes how dramatically the world of work is changing.   

6.0 Developing Young Creative-Tech talent in the city 
 6.1 An earlier section of this study sought to recognise how important ‘creative-tech’ skills are for the future of the European economy, how much skill shortages in Science, Technology, Engineering, Art and Maths (STEAM) disciplines are constraining many high growth firms and how Europe risks losing the best talent to other cities around the globe. Digital Technologies are also important to many Millenials and Generation-Y entrepreneurs. ICT enables people to work globally without changing location.  6.2 In addition to the above issue, many authors have started to recognise how automation and technology is likely to impact on labour markets going forward and further reinforced the importance of these skills to ensure young people possess the skills and capabilities to deliver the higher value tasks that are unlikely to be capable of being automated, going forward.  6.3 Much of the educational reform work examined through this study suggests a significant number of cities find the whole process of educational reform to deliver better creative-tech talent a little challenging, largely because much of the governance of the education system and/or the curriculum structure is led by national, or in some cases, regional government actors rather than the city.  6.4 In addition to this challenge, increasing numbers of Gen-Y are turning away from technician and STEM careers. The reasons for this are complex, but include a mix of issues, including the perception of many young people that technician careers are too formalised, regimented and insufficiently creative for them, peer pressure, media representation and parental influence. Ultimately, this is resulting in fewer young people choosing to pursue these careers, in favour of more humanistic subjects. That said, there is evidence of some interesting work being undertaken across Europe to try and increase young people’s interest in STEAM careers.  6.5 This diminishing interesting in pursuing science, technology and engineering careers has the potential to have a significant impact on Europe’s economy. In 2007, a Carnegie Foundation commission found that a nation’s capacity to innovate and thrive in the modern workforce depends on a foundation of math and science learning. They concluded that a sustained, vibrant democracy is dependent upon this foundation in STEAM.  6.6 Again, research undertaken through this study suggests that really effective systems for developing more technician workers generally rely on trying to build ‘whole systems’ solutions, rather than just delivering one or two piecemeal initiatives. Generally speaking, good ‘Creative-Tech’ Talent systems generally include some or all of the following;   In School Delivery of ‘Creative-Tech’ Skills.  6.7 In the majority of cities examined, our research suggested the secondary educational system was either structured around a single tier (comprehensive) system or a two tier (vocational and grammar) system.  6.8 Clearly, there is a massive amount of variety in the different training and educational systems around Europe, and this could be the subject of a whole standalone project. In a limited number of cases, some cities who have managed to re-structure their primary and secondary education systems to try and improve their capability to generate more Tech talent.  6.9 In order to improve the effectiveness of the educational system in delivering against the future needs of employers, policy makers have suggested utilising a range of tools and techniques, including24; Innovative Governance Solutions: Involving employers in helping to deliver educational outcomes; Strategic Planning Approaches: Developing skills strategies to articulate what the needs of employers are and shape the delivery of education outcomes; Data Driven Solutions: Using Labour Market Studies to encourage schools to deliver improved educational outcomes;  Qualification Framework Solutions: Involving employers more actively in designing Qualification Frameworks for key industries;  Innovative Funding solutions: Ensuring that education bodies secure their funding for training young people from employers, rather than the state;  6.10 In reality, a range of these types of tools are needed to improve the effectiveness of the skills system at delivering what employers need. City officials will need to look carefully at how their skills systems are organised, identify what ‘locus of control’ they have over changing and shaping the system, and develop a suite of policy interventions which suit their particular circumstances.  6.11 In addition to trying to design a skills system that provides the skilled people that a city needs to perform effectively, many cities have also started to turn their attention towards ensuring their young people are equipped with the skills needed to succeed in the world of work. In simple terms, many authors describe these skills as ‘Enterprise Skills’. It is generally recognised how important providing young people with good quality enterprise skills is, in developing an effective talent management system.  6.12 The EU’s framework for key competences identifies and defines the key abilities and knowledge that a person needs to achieve employment, personal fulfilment, social inclusion and active citizenship in today’s rapidly changing world. In this context, enterprise competences are defined as an individual’s ability to turn ideas into action. This transversal set of skills refers to creativity, innovation and risk-taking as well as general management skills needed to achieve objectives.  6.13 Enhancement of enterprise skills is endorsed as a key long-term priority in the ET 2020 framework. The Europe 2020 strategy also recognises it is crucial to the transition to a knowledge-based society. The importance of enhancing creativity, innovation and enterprise through education is highlighted in three flagship initiatives: ‘Youth on the move’, ‘An Agenda for new skills and jobs’ and ‘Innovation Union’.  6.14 Perhaps the most interesting case studies to look at about how a city might reconfigure its own education system to better prepare people for the future world of work is provided by one of the partners in the GEN-Y City Project, Bologna, which has reformed its 14-19 education system, to prioritise a particular focus on strengthening the links between schools and the industries of the future. This in turn has led to the introduction of a new layer of technical schools (to augment the existing vocational and grammar schools) to create a stronger link between thinking and doing.   
7.0 Retaining young people in the city  
7.1 In addition to focusing on how to improve the development of Creative-Tech Talent in a city, cities that are doing well at this, but still suffering from significant out migration also need to think about what more they might do to retain more people in a city.  7.2 Clearly, placemaking forms an important part of any potential retention strategy, but urban planners also need to look at what they can do to improve the scale and quality of employment opportunities in the city. There are a range of things that cities might do to increase the quantity and quality of opportunity that exists in a city.  7.3 Generally speaking, talent retention strategies tend to focus on trying to ‘lock’ the indigenous population into a city by utilising a range of proactive labour market interventions to strengthen pathways from education into employment and self-employment in a city.  7.4 Investment in human capital is vital in ensuring cities have access to the talent they need to function effectively and efficiently. In order for any city to stimulate growth, improve their productivity and enhance their overall prosperity, cities need to fully harness the skills available in the labour market and direct their people at delivering growth in those areas of the economy that offer the greatest return.   Understanding missed retention opportunities. 7.5 Solving out-migration issues potentially has a much wider impact on the economy than merely impacting on the effective performance of businesses. It can also impact on the retention of young people in localities and therefore help support the creation of vibrant cities and sustainable communities. Given the financial pressures on the public sector, public intervention to address these issues is becoming increasingly challenging. In response to these issues, funding of the skills market in many areas across Europe is becoming increasingly demand orientated. However, there are a number of structural issues that can make it somewhat difficult to align the aspirations of young people with the needs of business, including weaknesses in Labour Market Information; weaknesses in employer knowledge & understanding; time lags in delivery; difficulties inspiring learners: funding difficulties etc.  7.6 In order to deal with these issues, cities need to think of the skills system as an eco-system, and design effective interventions to address each of the above challenges. In response to these issues, many member states are trying to push more of the cost of training young people onto young people themselves and/or businesses (through a greater reliance on an Apprenticeship Model). However, these inherent market failures can make co-creation a challenge.  7.7 That said, many cities are generally intervening in three or four key areas to improve the effective function of their labour markets, namely; Improving the alignment between the needs of employers & the career aspirations of young people; Improving the enterprise and work readiness skills of young people; Stimulating higher levels of interest in design and technology skills; Improving entrepreneurship pathways for young people; Improving the alignment of the skills system to deliver what employers need. 7.8 As far as employing Generation-Y people is concerned, many employers across Europe continue to report they are dissatisfied with the majority of job applicants’ skills. According to one McKinsey study26 27% reported that they have left a vacancy open in the past year because they could not find anyone with the right skills. 33% said the lack of skills is causing major business problems, in the form of cost, quality, or time. Employers from countries where youth unemployment is highest reported the greatest problems. According to this same study, 74% of education providers were confident that their graduates were prepared for work, but only 38% of young people and 35% of employers agreed.  7.9 Some of the reasons often cited for the current high levels of youth unemployment are the poor mismatch between the career aspirations of young people and the skills needs of employers; the poor work readiness skills of young people; and the fact that many employers, education providers, and young people simply fail to understand each another. Many students lack access to good quality information and guidance about what potential careers exist for them and many more do not pursue work experience, in spite of this being a good predictor of how quickly a young person will find a job after their studies are completed.  7.10 To refine their understanding of the issue, McKinsey divided young people and employers into segments to examine different interventions needed to achieve better education-to-employment outcomes. Specifically, they looked at how much support young people received on their path from education to employment, and the extent of their desire to develop skills that would make them more employable. From this work, they concluded that those that achieved a good employment outcome (the so-called ‘high achievers’) represented only 10% of the youth surveyed.  7.11 They also identified that this group succeeded because the young people in it receive a strong education and good information; they also focus on finding opportunities to build job skills. Another two segments, representing 11 percent of youths surveyed (what they called ‘coasters’ and ‘meanderers’) receive strong support but are less motivated and end up only moderately satisfied with their job outcomes.  7.12 The remaining four segments (79%) are frustrated by a lack of support and unhappy at their prospects. They exhibit different responses to these circumstances, from fighting for every opportunity they can get (but rarely succeeding) to losing heart and leaving education at the first opportunity.  Stimulating entrepreneurship amongst the Y-Generation. 7.13 In addition to improving the alignment between the skills that employer’s need and the career aspirations of young people, some cities have also sought to retain their more venturesome individuals by promoting a range of youth entrepreneurship programmes during the latter stages of particular educational pathways.  7.14 According to the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) and a Cornell University study into Youth Entrepreneurship in Europe whilst 48 % of young people in Europe indicated that self-employment would either be ‘very feasible’ or ‘quite feasible’ within the next five years, only 6.5% of people (2.67 million) between 15 and 29 were self-employed.  7.15 Taken together with the evidence in the increasing rise of the ‘micro-multinational’ and these figures suggest there is an increasing mismatch between the entrepreneurship aspirations of young people and the ability of many member states to help young people realise these dreams.   7.16 As far as aspirations are concerned, Poland takes the lead with more than half its working-age population expressing good self-perceived entrepreneurial capabilities. However, in most Nordic countries, as well as in Italy and France, fewer adults display confidence in their entrepreneurial competences.   7.17 Rates of actual youth self-employment differ between Member States, being highest in Italy and Greece (about 15% of those who work) and lowest in Germany and Denmark (3% or less).  7.18 In addition, labour markets with high levels of young people not in employment, education or training (NEETs) are also more likely to have high levels of young self-employed. This Cornell University study also found that; Young European entrepreneurs are more likely to run small-scale businesses and less likely to hire employees than older self-employed people. One in three of them work on a part-time basis and sectors where they are most active are construction, wholesale and retail, the primary sector and other service activities. Only one in three young self-employed in the EU is women. Therefore, the report suggests that attention should be paid to promoting entrepreneurship from a gender-equality perspective. Young self-employed people have different values and personality traits to non-entrepreneurs. Showing innovation, strong creativity, a willingness to take risks, independence and autonomy are characteristic of an entrepreneurial personality.  7.19 In light of this evidence, there are a range of potential interventions that policy makers could chose to utilise to support young people into entrepreneurship and retain them in the locality, including School Entrepreneurship Programmes; Graduate Entrepreneurship Programmes; Social Entrepreneurship Programmes; and Creative Entrepreneurship Programmes.  7.20 In many countries, closer cooperation between stakeholders in education and business is one of the means used to promote and implement entrepreneurship education. Again, the particular mix adopted in any particular city will depend on the starting point of the city, the goals of city administrators etc.  Encouraging Digital Entrepreneurship. 7.21 The European Digital City Index (EDCi) describes how well different European cities support digital entrepreneurship. Produced as part of the European Digital Forum, its ultimate aim is to support digital entrepreneurship across Europe.  7.22 According to NESTA, the index provides information about the strengths and weaknesses of local ecosystems Index for start-ups and scale-ups, allowing them to plan accordingly. For policy makers, the index provides a tool to benchmark cities and decide where they may need to devote more resources.  7.23 The current ranking of Digital Cities in the EDCi places London 1st; Amsterdam 2nd; Stockholm 3rd; Helsinki 4th; Copenhagen 5th; Paris 6th; Berlin 7th; Dublin 8th; Brussels 9th; and Munich 10th. None of the GEN-Y CITY partners appear in the top 35 cities.   
8.0 Attracting and embedding creative-tech talent in the city 
 8.1 Assuming a particular city has been reasonably successful in regenerating its urban environment and arresting any potential brain drain away from the city, it may choose to invest time and money in trying to develop additional talent retention policies, by appealing to global talents by starting to encourage them to locate in their city.  8.2 In reality, talent attraction is a far more complex issue than urban development and talent retention, as location decisions can also generally be linked to raft of additional issues, such as language, culture, salary levels, perception of place, affordability quality of life etc.  8.3 In support of much of the work covered to date, which indicates the design and layout of the city, the quality of life on offer and its reputation are key factors that underpin a city’s ability to attract top talent, in ‘Tools & Strategies for Innovative Talent Attraction and Retention’30, Tendensor identify ten attraction factors for cities and regions aiming to attract global talent; A place with a strong reputation; A critical mass of attractive employers and job offerings; A liveable city with scenes for a talented lifestyle; A range of suitable and affordable housing; Transport Connectivity which provides easy access to the world; A safe, healthy and clean local environment; World class public services;  An open social climate; A strong commitment to co-creating the future of the place; and A personal connection with the individual;  8.4 In addition to these issues, Tendensor also suggest talent attraction can be simplified by; Simple processes to help visitors to obtain work permits; High-quality pre-arrival information on working and living in a country; and A culture which welcomes foreigners;  8.5 However, in many member states, these issues are largely controlled by the national governments, rather than city administrations, so many not be capable of being altered. That said, in ‘Talent retention policy and initiatives in the Baltic Sea Region’31Tendensor identify 11 recommended activities and practices cities should use when trying to retain and attract talent; Create sound pre-arrival expectations through honest marketing and expectations management; Create one-stop-shop solutions for welcoming and soft landing of talent; Involve talents and social entrepreneurs in expat services– going from triple helix to quadruple helix partnerships; Help create professional and social networks for talents; Use cluster networks and open innovation platforms to facilitate soft landing and integration. Take steps to understand talents’ needs; Take steps to understand and satisfy business needs; Use internal branding and profiling to improve local pride;  Employ ‘sea turtle recruitment’ to re-attract the Diaspora;  Professionalize the talent management role; and Create awareness and mutual cultural intelligence between international talents and host communities.  8.6 Similarly, in ‘Talent Magnets: Cities and Universities Building the Workforce for a Knowledge Economy’32, the World Class Cities Partnership suggest that “successful cities utilize relationships for talent attraction and retention. Whether connecting with the Diaspora, creating job opportunities for college students through internships, or building roots to the city through housing opportunities. Cities benefit from building strong relationships between knowledge-economy workers and their city surroundings. Cities with strategies that recognize talent as a ‘flow’ – both inward and outward – appear to stay ahead of the game despite the effects of economic conditions, as they are able to establish connectedness with current residents and turn emigrants into ambassadors”.  8.7 They identify five key elements of successful talent attraction and retention strategies, namely; Early Student Integration upon graduation; Strong university/city partnerships (or quadruple helix partnerships); Strong brand promotion; Embracing Immigration; and  Striving for a high quality of life and cost of living;  Talent Segmentation  8.8 In common with most marketing programmes these days, it’s important to be clear about who the city is targeting when it’s seeking to attract talent to the area. Clearly, there is no point attracting people to come to a particular city if there are no opportunities for those people. Doing so could merely create too much negative press coverage.   In reality the target markets are likely to be based on the particular goals of the city and break down into a few key segments; Overseas Visitors: Tourism and leisure visitors, as traditionally targeted by traditional Destination Management Organisations; Business Visitors: as traditionally targeted through Foreign Direct Investment Agencies; Potential Workers: as traditionally targeted by the firms described earlier; International Students: likely particularly to be sought after by University partners; and Expat returners: encouraging those that have left their homeland to return home;  8.10 In many cities, the overseas visitor segment is the one that traditionally receives the greatest attention. That said, business visitors, workers, students and expat returners are generally more embedded than tourism visitors. In reality, many cities target these types of visitors through campaigns they run at main transportation hubs. If a location has an ambition to target international talent airports and train stations are ideal places to reach them.  8.11 If its returning expat’s that a city is looking to target then special holiday periods (such as Christmas) are a particularly useful time to target potential returners. Dublin, for example, ran a high profile campaign at the back end of 2015 targeting people returning home for the Christmas vacation.  8.12 As far as Foreign Direct investment is  concerned, whilst the traditional model has largely been about trying to target mobile business investment, the market is increasingly shifting to focus on individual entrepreneurs and ‘micro-multinationals’.  Defining the cities Unique Selling Proposition (USP)  8.13 Having understood who the city is trying to attract – or perhaps more importantly – what talent deficits the city is looking to plug, it’s important for any city to define what unique selling proposition (USP)the city has that can be used to create and build a point of difference for the city. If any analysis indicates that the city has a potentially weak offer for certain segments, then it may be that the city needs to invest further in its product, or programme, to create more hard and soft infrastructure.  8.14 Whatever USP is developed, these need to be based on the selected target segments and the brand positioning of the city. Recognising it is no longer enough to speak in general terms about a city’s specific sector strengths (e.g. life science, design, ICT or new materials) - because the competition to be truly globally significant in these sectors is fierce) further differentiation may be needed to identify niche, or a super-niche, segments within these industries.  8.15 Superficial slogans which don’t have a clear relevance to the actual reality of what a particular place has to offer can be counterproductive. These can be widely and easily undermined by third parties and create negative consumers whose experience doesn’t match their expectations.  8.16 Different features of the place should be packaged into themed attraction propositions. These need to include combinations of tangible ‘points of difference’ and ‘softer’ factors to inspire. Cities can no longer define or differentiate themselves on the old paradigms of the software city, or the life-science city, as these are too generic. Qualitative factors, such as values, identity, personalities, culture or habits need to be used to good effect to differentiate.   Improving the integration between consumer and business facing services.  8.17 In addition, recognising how important positive word of mouth is in generating favourable marketing for a city amongst an increasingly globally networked Y-Generation, it’s also vital for cities to understand what ‘touch-points’ an individual has in a city, and how their contact with a range of agencies and environments can influence their opinion of a city.   8.18 Recognising that the rise of ‘micro-multinationals’ means ‘old paradigms’ between a range of different departments and services in the city don’t really have a place going forward , it’s important for the city to consider how best to integrate traditional consumer focused services (like enterprise and entrepreneurship skills; destination management; and professional and social soft landing networks) and business focused services (like business support; Inward Investment; and soft landing services).  8.19 Moving forward, in response to these issues, many municipalities are rethinking the way these services are organised and endeavouring to ensure the ‘customer journey’ within the city is more joined up and effective. In seeking to review the potential needs of customers and how they interact with a city, planners should explore the key messages customers get and also ensure different agencies are aware of the services that others provide. The diagram overleaf illustrates how these various services need to be far more integrated in the current market environment.  The visitor destination offer as part of the talent attraction offer.  8.20 In thinking about talent attraction in this way, it’s clear that the discipline has borrowed greatly from the principles of visitor destination marketing. Indeed, there is an argument for suggesting that visitor destination marketing forms an essential component of the talent attraction toolkit, as it supports a city to reinforce its brand values and draw in visitors to experience all that it has to offer.  8.21 Indeed, many cities seek to develop their leisure and tourism offer as an essential component of their talent attraction programme, and this is why for many cities it’s important to have a strong focus on building and developing the independent retail and creative and cultural sectors as part of the overall strategy of place development. Cities that have a strong international leisure and tourism offer and that offer a wide variety of cultural amenities and events are more likely to attract talents. More and more of the Y-Generation are building their lifestyles around creative and cultural experiences, although some may not recognise this is what is drawing them to a city, favouring instead to simply describe the draw of ‘the buzz of the city’.  8.22 In addition, the creative and cultural industries can help promote tolerance and a wider openness in society – both of which are attributes many of the Y-Generation look for in a city of choice.  8.23 Encouraging a themed programme of creative and cultural events – comprising a mix of internationally renowned festivals and home grown events – will have a direct economic impact, help a city strengthen its reputation and international brand image and mobilise citizens to become more engaged in their city’s development (which is also likely to have a positive impact on talent retention).

"Key to the city: unlocking open innovation.  
Introduction. 
This report provides a baseline evaluation for a pilot transfer network examining the theme of Open Innovation. York City (UK) Council’s Genius model provides the framework for the practice transfer. There are three ‘receiving’ cities. Siracusa (Italy) has ambitious plans to establish new, more collaborative relationships with its citizens and hopes to employ an open innovation approach to the democratisation of public services. In San Sebastian (Spain), the economic development agency recognises the critical need to connect academia, research and enterprise to support a thriving and sustainable economy and is exploring how open innovation can play a part in this endeavour. Tallinn’s (Estonia) education department wants to build on its highly successful school system to further enhance the leadership and management of educational institutions; they are asking how an open innovation strategy might contribute to the development of head teachers. The opening chapter provides an overview of Open Innovation – The State of The Art – introducing the concept and providing a brief history of its development and an assessment of the key components. Key “learning points” have been identified to guide readers who may be new to this concept. At a time when cities face declining democratic legitimacy, tight budgets and ever more complex problems, open innovation is appealing. It offers the potential for solutions that traditional markets and government policies have struggled to do1. Openness unlocks knowledge and assets that are invaluable to cash strapped city authorities. It brings about engagement in communities because it promotes transparency and it empowers users by involving them in the innovation. Open innovation processes ensure that the final innovation itself is more relevant and scalable because it has been shaped by the users who know how it will work best, and know how it will fit in their environment. The second chapter identifies the ambitions of the four cities through the development of an Outcomes Framework. We have asked the cities; what is your ambition for this project and how will you know you have achieved it? Furthermore, the four cities have collective, programme level ambitions that are also articulated. The framework will also establish the conditions for successful transfer. On the face of it, to share a model of practice between cities appears straightforward. But we want to understand the cultural and other contextual ingredients that enable effective and sustainable practice transfer as well as the tools and techniques that can contribute to a successful outcome. Through this process of reflective practice we hope to contribute to a wider review of how best to spread great ideas between Europe’s cities. The following chapters provide more detail about each city, their context and ambitions, starting with York, where further details of the Genius process are explained. More detailed descriptions will appear on our project web site <insert link> where we will also post workshop agendas, presentations, training plans and other related materials. 
Chapter 1: Key to the city: unlocking open innovation 
Innovation can come from anywhere. Universities, businesses and communities have great ideas and skills that enhance the innovation process. Open innovation is grounded in this principle. It is defined by the breaking down of an organisation’s boundaries to encourage the flow of knowledge and creativity both internally and externally ; to promote innovation. Many commercial organisations have been using this principle brilliantly for over 20 years and it is the source of much of their revenue: Google allow their employees to spend 20% of their time pursuing their own interests. The ideas that have emerged from this have generated 50% of new product launches. Similarly, Proctor and Gamble (P&G) source 50% of their ideas from outside their organisation. Given the value open innovation brings to corporate firms, these models are attracting the attention of governments and cities across the world. At a time when cities face declining democratic legitimacy, tight budgets and ever more complex problems, open innovation is appealing. It offers the potential for solutions that traditional markets and government policies have struggled to do. Openness unlocks knowledge and assets that are invaluable to cash strapped city authorities. It brings about engagement in communities because it promotes transparency and it empowers users by involving them in the innovation. Open innovation processes ensure that the final innovation itself is more relevant and scalable because it has been shaped by the users who know how it will work best, and know how it will fit in their environment. In recognition of the promise of open innovation for governments and cities, the model sits at the heart of the European Strategy: ‘Europe 2020’. The strategy prioritises smart, sustainable and inclusive growth core themes of open innovation. The popularity of open innovation is also seen in the swell of enthusiasm of social innovation which has many overlapping principles: collaboration across diverse groups, involvement of the user as well as a joint focus on solving complex problems for the good of the public 6. This summary begins with an introduction to the emergence of open innovation. It then goes on to address how this is being adopted in cities, before exploring the key stages of open innovation: understanding the challenge, coming up with the idea and sustaining and embedding. In this last section, this summary highlights that, without the capabilities and systems to support open innovation, it is unlikely to have great impact. To ground it in reality, some of the most exciting international examples of open innovation in cities are showcased.
 2. Open innovation in cities 
Faced with budget cuts and difficult challenges, cities and governments are looking to the open innovation models of commercial organisations to try to solve problems that existing market and government structures have been unable fix. Cities are very different entities to corporate firms – cities comprise of many organisations with differing interests, larger populations and their services have many interdependencies. However, there are three core principles of commercial open innovation that cities are beginning to harness well. In doing so, they are starting to find solutions to complex problems and to develop different, better and lower cost services while at the same time, able to build more vibrant communities. This section will first look at the context of open innovation in cities and then explore the principles of transparency collaboration and participation. Lastly, this section will feature an open innovation case study at a national level.
 2.1 Open cities and governments 
Learning point: Open innovation can drive social value in governments and cities. Throughout the 20th century, governments were typically liberal. Later, as governments recovered from world wars, governance structures were often centralised and focused on building a welfare state. Today, a new governance structure exists open governance which emphasises citizen empowerment and social innovation (figure 2). The swell of popularity for this new form of governance has come about through three key drivers: first, technological; second, financial and third, rising public expectations. Technological developments and the internet have been major catalysts for open cities and social innovation. Through the internet, citizens can access knowledge on public services and information on public spending. Authorities and cities are more accountable for their decisions and are subject to closer scrutiny. Citizens, as a result, are taking a greater interest in the running and creation of public services. In turn, they are demanding even more information be made available publicly putting pressure on many governments to grant ‘Right to Information’. This is helping cities to build a better understanding of challenges they face and better enable citizens to contribute to public services. Financial pressure is often cited as a key driver for innovation. The public purse is not bottomless; increasingly demographic pressure combined with recession has led cities and governments to review their services and models. Public services and value have traditionally been the responsibility of governments and cities. However, open innovation recognises the value of external groups in the generation of social value and unlocks their ability to act – including private sector investment, citizens who help themselves and community around them as well as the growing third sector. At the same time, open innovation provides opportunities for cities to maintain their competitiveness and sustain economic growth. Public expectations are also driving city organisations towards a more open approach as they try to respond to higher demands. Increasingly, society wants more involvement in how services are run. When people experience a slick, user centred product or service from the likes of Amazon or Apple, they can come to expect the same of public services. Through social media there are increasing means to broadcast their opinions and demand more of their public services. As a result, power no longer sits so comfortably in the hands of governments and markets alone. Entire governments have been toppled through social action supported by social media. 
2.2 Principles of open innovation in cities 
Collaboration is a fundamental principle of open innovation. It is even more so for fragmented ecosystems like cities with diverse groups and differing interests. Open innovation processes can bring these groups together and in doing so break down conflicts and build cohesive communities. Collaboration is key for the complex issues cities are trying to tackle as there are multiple interdependencies, and ideas may be lost in translation between groups. Overcoming the problems of translation requires an understanding of tacit knowledge where knowledge is hard to explain like trying to describe a way of working or playing an instrument. To overcome this, continued and iterative interaction between different groups is needed24. Creating the systems and platforms for this interaction is an important part of the innovation process and should be built in. Transparency and open practices bring about a more vibrant democracy. Citizens from all backgrounds increasingly have access to information about how the city is run. As innovative city leaders share information on money invested, priorities and progress trust can be built amongst citizens. It is trust that enables collaboration, generating further innovation. Where old closed systems alienated, new open systems can engage and excite. In Seoul, Park Won soon has adopted a citizen--centred, hands-on communicative style of politics and keeps a wall of post-it notes with requests from citizens. His team have also developed a 1000 Oasis Ideas platform: where residents can make suggestions about how Seoul is run and the team can respond to citizens’ complaints. Learning point: open innovation stimulates a vibrant and inclusive democracy Participation is a principle of open innovation that builds empowerment and taps into societal assets. Open cities listen and provide opportunities for citizens to play a role in the shaping of innovation in cities defining the issues that matter to them and empowering them to take control of the challenges facing them. It unlocks resources that are vital to cash poor city governments. Driven by the purpose of public good, communities are often willing volunteers, who help come up with and refine solutions. Involving users and the wider city ecosystem enables the generation of more relevant, sustainable and impactful services designed around real needs and greater understanding of what this might mean in practice. Developing more relevant innovations importantly means cost savings and risk reduction28. 
Chapter 2: Ambition and Outcomes Framework 
Why GeniUS ? Originally funded by NESTA as part of their Creative Councils Programme GeniUS! developed in partnership between Science City York and City of York Council is a simple idea based on engaging a range of stakeholders (residents, the business sector , charities, students, and public services) to identify and create ways to solve problems and improve the city. Through the URBACT II Pilot Transfer Network, the model – now GeniUS! Open - is being piloted with San Sebastian (Spain), Siracusa (Italy), and Tallin (Estonia) though a dynamic process lead by the City of York (UK). How will we know if the pilot transfer has been successful? A comprehensive, high-level outcome framework has been co-designed with each city piloting GeniUS! Open to highlight priorities and establish how progress will be measured. This framework is embedded in the programme evaluation process to facilitate a structured assessment of the distance travelled and (where possible) the social value (the non-financial impact of the programme for stakeholders) of each pilot and for the programme as a whole. The framework establishes a focus on outcomes while recognising that there are many interrelated factors in delivering these initiatives and that the indicators do not tell the whole story. In order to measure the implementation and effectiveness of GeniUS! Open pilot, data will be collected on each identified outcome and the associated indicators to find out what is or isn’t happening and why. Each indicator has four parts: population, target, threshold and timeline. The outcome indicators are not a set of targets; rather, they aim to identify where good progress is being made and where more work needs to be done to further define the open innovation concept. We define outcome as a change in a target population’s skills, attitudes, knowledge, behaviours, status, or life condition brought about by experiencing a programme, project or initiative. The indicators are measurable evidence of meeting the associated outcome. Indicators are visible signs that demonstrate that the outcomes have been achieved. Often, indicators can be counted (quantitative), but sometimes evidence will be something more descriptive (qualitative). Co-creating an outcome framework for an open innovation process is an iterative and living process. The lead and thematic experts working with GeniUS! Open will be reviewing the framework with each city periodically throughout pilot. The final report will offer an evaluation and a reflection on the outcomes achieved and the distance travelled throughout the unfolding of GeniUS! Open.

"Healthy Ageing Cities’ Action for Healthy and Active Ageing.   
FOREWORD  
The older population in Europe is growing at a considerably faster rate than that of the world’s total population. The number of older persons in Europe has tripled over the last 50 years and will more than triple again over the next 50 years. The older population is also undergoing a process of demographic ageing: the most rapidly growing group is that aged 80 years and over. The shift in population age structure, due to the combined effect of both increasing longevity and decreasing fertility, has a profound impact on a broad range of economic, political and social conditions. Demographic ageing is at the same time a challenge and an opportunity in a society that is changing its ‘face’: fewer young people and young adults, older workers, increasing number of pensioners and very elderly people. Within this framework people’s needs as well as older people’s expectations on life quality opportunities change. Hence, new forms of solidarity and of intervention must be developed promoting cooperation between generations. Cooperation based on both mutual support and exchange of experiences and skills is welcome. This well-known global trend is also ongoing in Italy and the city of Udine has given special attention to developing policies aiming at active ageing with a particular attention to citizens’ engagement and intergenerational initiatives within a deliberative and participative methodological perspective. The first step to move to cope with these changes and to provide effective services is an overall understanding and analysis of the local context and the living conditions of citizens, in particular vulnerable groups. Focusing on older age, different approaches have been combined to raise awareness of demographic ageing and better meet citizens’ needs through more effective strategies and health policies. Much has been done in Udine to promote healthy lifestyles and health literacy within the community to increase awareness on the importance of an active and healthy ageing. This experience will be fully put at partners’ disposal within this transnational network.  
The State of the Art 
General presentation Over the last decades increasing longevity throughout the countries of the European Union (EU) has resulted in a higher number of individuals reaching old age. This trend is mainly due to two factors: the low mortality recorded among those people born after the Second World War and the improvement in life expectancy of those aged 65 and over. These trends have led to an increase in the number of the oldest old population (aged 80 and years and over) (Oeppen and Vaupel, 2002; Rau et al., 2008; Meslé and Vallin, 2011; Marc Luy et al., 2011; Crimmins et al., 2011). At the same time, the steady decline in fertility, which started in different periods and proceeded at different paces among European countries, has had a significant impact on the decrease of the young population. The combined action of increasing longevity and decreasing fertility has driven a common growing trend in aging, in relative terms, in almost all EU-27 countries1 (National Research Council, 2001; Gaymu et al., 2008; Christensen et al., 2009). This ongoing process has led to major changes in economic and social relations, impacting on growth and public spending, making it difficult to maintain sound and sustainable public finances in the long term (Zaidi, 2010; Deriu, 2011). Oldest-old aging societies are pressing governments “to implement health and social policies specifically aimed at coping with the fast growing number of people in their ‘third’ and ‘fourth’ age” (Caselli et al., 2003:45-46). If we look more specifically at the countries involved in the “Healthy Ageing” Project, it is worthwhile noting that they are not homogeneous when considering both their population trends and demographic structure. Actually, if we move on consider the proportion of people aged 65 and over in 2013, we can observe on the one hand, that United Kingdom has the lowest percentage (17.2%), one percentage point below the EU-27 average (18.2%); immediately followed by France with a percentage of over 65 at 17.6%, very close to the EU-27 level. On the other hand, Italy records the highest percentage of over 65 (21,2%) in 2013, more than one fifth of the total population. Lithuania is currently in line with the European average (graph. 1). The pattern becomes more critical if we consider the proportion of the oldest old population (80 years and over) that since 2000 in the EU-27 has risen considerably from 3,3% up to 5.1% in 2013. Italy represents the oldest country in Europe with a 6.3% figure - well above the European average - while United Kingdom and Lithuania record lower percentage levels (4.7% and 4.8% respectively). France (5.6%) is in the middle according to the data shown in graph. 2. The combined effect of increasing longevity and decreasing fertility is impacting on population structure resulting in an unbalance between adult and elder generations so that the economic burden of an increasing amount of elderly people (persons aged 65 and over) is sustained by a diminishing population aged 15-64. This is the reason why old age dependency ratios are steadily growing all over Europe. In 2013 the average level of this indicator was at 27.5: it means that for every four adults there is an older person to be sustained. Most of the European countries are experiencing this trend and recent projections have foreseen a fast increase in the old-age dependency ratio that will reach in 2070 in the EU-28 the 49,35 threshold (graph. 3). Among the countries involved in the “Healthy Ageing” Project, at that date Italy will be the only one to be far above that EU-27 threshold, reaching a 53.59 old age dependency ratio. France and United Kingdom will register figures quite below the EU-27 average (respectively at 44.21 and 42.43). Lithuania will be the only country of this group where in 2070 a significant decreasing on this indicator could be registered. The main factors driving population ageing EU population ageing is the result of two underlying trends: a) low fertility rates (1,58 children born per female in 2012 in the EU-27 countries on average); b) increasing life expectancy for both males and females (77.5 and 83.1 in 2012 in the EU-27). As far as the first point is concerned, the fertility rate pattern among the countries involved in the “Healthy Ageing Project” is quite different. Italy has one of the lowest fertility rates and it is still far from reaching the EU-27 threshold even if its trend is steadily increasing. France and United Kingdom report the best figures with respectively 2.01 and 1.92 in 2012 (close to the level of population replacement); Lithuania is in the middle with a 1.60. It is well known that France provides women with services supporting the work-life balance according to a system of social policies based on a gender mainstreaming approach. In UK, according to a strategy more oriented to the market, services supporting family choices are actually available for women. Projections by 2030 point out a steady increase in total fertility rate (TFR) all over the EU countries. Anyway, according to recent projections, these positive trends in TFR do not seem to be able to contrast the population ageing process. This question is considerably related to the levels of longevity reported in these countries. In fact, it is worth noting that a general increasing trend in life expectancy levels is ongoing all over Europe even if in Lithuania figures are far below the EU-27 average fixed in 2012 at 83.1 years for women and 77.5 for men. Lithuania reports a life expectancy of 79.6 years for women and 68.4 for men, 3.5 and 9 p.p. respectively under the European threshold. Italy shows the best performance in longevity if compared with France and United Kingdom but the best case of female longevity is France (tab. 1). Life expectancy data should be analysed alongside figures on healthy living in later years (e.g.: at 65 years). In fact, population ageing is expected to considerably increase the need for care services among elderly people if ageing is not accompanied by preventative actions and initiatives aimed at maintaining people mentally and physically active. The indicator Healthy Life Years (HLY) at age 65 measures the number of years that a person at age 65 is still expected to live in a healthy condition. HLY is a health expectancy indicator, which combines information on mortality and morbidity. The data required are the age specific prevalence (proportions) of the population in healthy and unhealthy conditions and age-specific mortality information. A healthy condition is defined by the absence of limitations in functioning/disability. The indicator is also called disability-free life expectancy (DFLE). Life expectancy at age 65 is defined as the mean number of years still to be lived by a person at age 65, if subjected throughout the rest of his or her life to the current mortality conditions (Eurostat Indicators Database – Metadata). According to the data shown in the graphics above, even if Italy is the country where the life expectancy of women reaches the highest value, it does not mean that the years gained are lived in good health. Italy is the only country among those considered in this analysis, where the healthy life years at 65 indicator is lower for women than for men (7 years vs almost 8). So, women live longer but not in better health than men. For this reason, planning policies oriented to support ageing among women represents a priority for local governance. In Lithuania the HLY indicator is particularly low: it is 5.5 for men and about 6 for women. It means that healthy ageing should represent a field in which experience new solutions for improving life conditions in later ages. France and United Kingdom are two best performing countries, where HLY indicator varies between 9 and 11 years. Anyway, the data show quite different trends. In France while the female HLY indicator is improving, that for males is decreasing; in United Kingdom both women and men HLY are decreasing converging to a common figure (about 10.5 years). Even if in these countries the life expectancy in good health at age 65 is higher than in Italy and in Lithuania they are actually facing new challenges that call for new solutions and interventions. The “Healthy Ageing” Project provides these countries, and more specifically the city partners in the pilot transfer network, with the opportunity to share experiences and to find out new ideas for improving life quality at later ages. It is quite clear that policies priorities and approaches are different in these four contexts. Anyway, there is a common denominator affecting Grand Poitiers, Brighton & Hove and Klaipeda: the weak commitment of managing authorities, public managers and politicians on this issue and in particular on older people’s needs. In light of a general public spending retrenchment, managing authorities seem to be more keen on investing on policies oriented to young generations. So, in all these three cities it is becoming increasingly important motivating managing authorities to support initiatives based on intergenerational approaches. This is the case of Grand Poitiers, that is particularly interested in transferring the microproject “move your minds…minds on the move”; the case of Brighton which is interested in new experimental forms of Urban Gardens to involve students and sustain the intergenerational exchange. It is quite different the situation in Edinburgh where a wide and well articulated action plan on active and healthy ageing is already ongoing, offering a variety of opportunities and services to older people. Anyway, Edinburgh is actually interested in finding out new ideas as well as experiencing new methodologies at work for activating innovative services to cope with new challenges in a more effective way. Udine, a city of the Eastern Region of Italy, is the lead partner within this network, having implemented a number of activities and experimented new methodologies that have significantly contributed to improve active ageing at local level. This project represents also for Udine an occasion for learning from other cities innovative solutions for increasing the supply of services for the active and healthy ageing of older people.

 Heritage as Opportunity.
Develop integrated and innovative management strategies for historic urban landscapes.
Sustainable Management Strategies for Vital Historic Urban Landscapes.
The network ‘HerO - Heritage as Opportunity’.
The URBACT II thematic network ’HerO – Heritage as Opportunity’: Strengthening the attractiveness and competitiveness of historic urban landscapes in Europe. The rapidly changing basic conditions of modern times pose a major challenge to the management of historic urban landscapes in Europe. The imbalance between a healthy economic development and the preservation of the historic urban fabric often results in either economic stagnancy or the loss of cultural heritage values and with it the loss of identity. In this context, the network HerO, a partnership between the cities aimed at developing integrated and innovative management strategies for historic urban landscapes. The project’s main objective was facilitating the right balance between the preservation of built cultural heritage and the sustainable, future-proof socio-economic development of historic towns in order to strengthen their attractiveness and competitiveness. Emphasis was placed on managing conflicting usage interests and capitalising the potential of cultural heritage assets for economic, social and cultural activities (‘Heritage as Opportunity’). To allow for an effective impact of the HerO network activities on local policies, each project partner set up a ‘Local Support Group’. Involving all relevant stakeholders, future-oriented urban development plans, so called ‘management plans’, for the old town areas have been developed. The experience gained is published in several outputs of the HerO network, aiming at different target groups such as the European Commission, mayors of historic towns, city administrations and practitioners dealing with the sustainable development of historic neighbourhoods. This guidebook is one of these outputs and it aims at city administrations and practitioners.  The HerO network cooperated closely with ‘Heritage Europe’ (formerly ‘European Association of Historic Towns and Regions’), an alliance of nearly one thousand historic towns, founded in 1999 by the Council of Europe. By this cooperation the HerO partners could benefit from the experiences of other historic cities in Europe while developing strategies for the sustainable development of their old town areas. In the global urbanised world, the European historical compact city, preserving its cultural heritage appears to be a paradigm for European citizens and tourists from the outside world. Urban landscape and architectural beauty do not fit automatically with quality of modern life, sustainable environment and the needs of contemporary economy. Within the framework of the URBACT programme the HerO thematic network took advantage to raise together these imbricate issues, creating a large partnership of European cities, in order to exchange among themselves and analyse the various challenges. Finally they achieved to propose concrete solutions, each city developing an integrated cultural heritage management plan. Would the production of this guidebook been possible without the support of the European territorial cooperation programme URBACT? Probably not. 
Preface. 
Preface. 
URBACT provided financial and expertise means indeed, and strong demands regarding methodology and concrete local impact. Moreover HerO benefited from the legitimacy and active support of the European Commission, as a Fast Track labelled network, to address national and regional authorities for supporting the design and financing of the integrated cultural heritage management plans. This guidebook has been prepared by elected people, practitioners supported by local stakeholders gathered in the Local Support Group, assisted by experts. It is evidence based. The partner cities recommend policies and methods which they have experimented with and implemented on the ground. Numerous names and qualifications could appear in the closing credits of the HerO guidebook. It is the result of a three year collective work. I am honoured and proud to introduce you to such a useful Secretariat and innovative guidebook. 
INTRODUCTION TO THE GUIDEBOOK. 
There are many cities in Europe and worldwide with historic urban areas and outstanding cultural heritage values. These areas are often highly contested arenas of diverse and partly conflicting interests and development ideas, which challenge the safeguarding of the cultural heritage. A non-balanced handling of the conflicts can lead to a loss of cultural heritage and identity or economic stagnancy and non-competitive areas with low amenity values. Therefore, the challenge of historic urban areas is to match their inherited urban structure, identity and buildings with the manifold demands of residents, visitors and businesses. The goal is to capitalise on the cultural heritage for attractive and liveable cities with mixed-use historic urban areas keeping up quality of life of residents and visitors, the identity of the place and safeguarding the cultural heritage for present and future generations. The motto is: Traditional, uncoordinated mono-sectoral approaches are not adequate to that. There is the strong need for an integrated management approach which links the safeguarding of the cultural heritage with the sustainable development of historic urban areas (heritage-led urban development as cross-sectional task). In this context, the URBACT II thematic network HerO has developed an innovative management strategy supporting an integrated, sustainable development of historic urban areas, strengthening their attractiveness and competitiveness by capitalising on cultural heritage assets. Based on the exchange of experience through a series of seminars and two expert workshops and on case studies of the network partners the instrument of an Integrated Cultural Heritage Management Plan was developed and tested in support of the new approach to the management of historic urban areas. This guidebook provides guidance for city administrations and practitioners on how to apply this new approach by producing an Integrated Cultural Heritage Management Plan. It describes the main characteristics of such a plan and presents the main steps for its production in support of safeguarding and capitalising cultural heritage for a sustainable urban development. 
BENEFITS OF SAFEGUARDING CULTURAL HERITAGE. 
European historic towns with their cultural heritage present unique urban landscapes in Europe and worldwide. They constitute an integral part of European history, identity and regional diversity. Their centres are often multifunctional, representing a fabric of mixed uses, a vibrant and diverse co-existence of jobs and public services, housing, crafts, communication, education, recreation and culture, retail and services, gastronomy and tourism. Such multifunctional historic areas are living organisms and vital living spaces for their inhabitants, visitors and entrepreneurs, being the focal point of daily life. They are a model for the sustainable European city. As a matter of fact, historic centres offer both a compact, dense, human scale living framework and proximity; they are walking and cycling friendly, thus providing a good quality of life to their citizens. Historic towns are shaped in particular by their cultural heritage assets – monuments, groups of buildings, historic sites, social values and traditions – which present a multitude of opportunities and economic, social and environmental benefits.  
Economic benefits.  
The revitalisation of historic urban areas and the safeguarding of cultural heritage contribute to the creation of jobs, businesses and economic growth through 1. work generated for local businesses by the labour-intensive repair and renovation of the historic fabric; 2. restored old buildings which provide special places for businesses (i.e. creative industry); 3. the improved location quality and image through the heritage environment and infrastructure for business activities, in particular for the creative, cultural, tourism and gastronomy industry, and as location factor for investments; 4. attracting and binding highly-skilled workers, businesses, visitors and tourists through the attractiveness and uniqueness of the place (the cultural heritage helps to distinguish from other towns in the global competition; cultural heritage as “trade mark”), 5. public investments in the cultural heritage as catalyst for the revitalisation of the wider area, attracting local as well as external private investments and stimulating the creation of new developments.  
Social and cultural benefits.  
The revitalisation of historic urban areas and the safeguarding of the cultural heritage assets contribute to 1. providing a place for cultural and creative activities; 2. providing local identity, pride and community spirit for a place to live and work; 3. learning and knowing about its history and culture; 4. recuperating patrimonial value; 5. activating citizens to get involved in the urban development; 6. improving the quality of life (location quality). This supports binding and attracting new and old inhabitants, creating a “corporate feeling” and strengthening the identification with the town and places.  
Environmental benefits. 
The maintenance and reuse of the historic fabric, in particular of historic buildings and the historic centre, contribute to the efficient handling of natural resources through 1. reducing the need and consumption of new materials (e.g. for construction); 2. reducing further land consumption (use of already used areas and surfaces); 3. securing the “city of short ways” (historic urban areas generally show a compact urban structure and are located in the city centre or nearby, reducing the length of transport ways and causing less commuting); 4. attractive historic urban areas which contribute to the mitigation of suburbanisation trends (people stay and live in the centre). 
Giving Identity. 
Historic towns with well-maintained cultural heritage assets provide a distinct identity and image, conveying a feeling of home, community, likeness and appreciation. Often citizens are very proud of their local heritage, identifying themselves strongly with their town, which also leads to the development of a collective identity of the residents and stronger identification with the place. Well-maintained cultural heritage serves also to develop a positive image to outsiders as a unique soft location factor in the global competition of attracting enterprises, skilled working force, inhabitants and tourists. “Historic buildings, open spaces and contemporary architecture contribute significantly to the value of the city by branding the city’s character. … Historic and contemporary architecture constitute an asset to local communities, which should serve educational purposes, leisure, tourism, and secure market value of properties.” (UNESCO World Heritage Centre, 2005: Vienna Memorandum on `World Heritage and Contemporary Architecture Managing the Historic Urban Landscape, 20 May 2005, Vienna, Austria, p. 5.). Summarising, it is essential to safeguard and to capitalize on cultural heritage assets. At the same time it is necessary to match them with newly emerging needs for sustainable and future-oriented cities. This demands an integrated, actionoriented and continuous handling of the cultural heritage in the urban development framework. 
A NEW APPROACH TO THE MANAGEMENT OF HISTORIC TOWNS. 
Historic urban areas – particular places to live, work, shop and socialise – have to live up to manifold demands of residents, visitors and businesses. These demands bring historic urban areas into a highly contested arena of diverse and partly conflicting interests and development ideas, which on the one hand are to be balanced and coordinated and on the other hand have to be harmonised with the demand of safeguarding the cultural heritage. Traditional, uncoordinated mono-sectoral approaches are not sufficient for that. Within the HerO network a new approach to manage historic urban areas was developed to match the inherited historic urban landscape and structure as well as the identity of the place (the ‘cultural heritage’) with the demands of its users and to turn the cultural heritage, both tangible and intangible, into a prime resource to fulfil these competing demands, without downgrading its intrinsic qualities. Under the guiding principle of pursuing the sustainable development of a city and linking and balancing the safeguarding of the cultural heritage with the socio-economic development of the area, the new approach aims in particular at safeguarding the cultural heritage values as they make the place unique and distinctive and can be a strong asset for development and developing multifunctional historic urban areas which make the site attractive to live, work and spend time in for all the different stakeholders such as inhabitants, visitors and entrepreneurs. This, in turn, brings in resources which can be used for the safeguarding of the cultural heritage values. This requires co-ordinating and managing the demands and the sometimes conflicting needs of the different stakeholders with the demands of the cultural heritage and raising their appreciation and awareness of the stakeholders on the cultural heritage values and their (possible) contribution to sustainable urban development (cf. chapter 2 „Benefits of Safeguarding Cultural Heritage“). 
3.1.1 Integrated. 
The integrated approach – being comprehensive, cross-thematic and cross-sectoral in comparison to sectoral approaches – links, balances and coordinates the safeguarding of the cultural heritage with related sectoral fields for the development of the area. This is essential as cultural heritage is affecting and interacting with a variety of other field of actions in historic urban areas. For example, economic development can be positively affected by well-preserved historic buildings which provide a special atmosphere and a unique location for business activities. The (cultural) tourism sector relies on attractive historic urban areas; also well-preserved buildings in a historic setting present attractive housing areas. Such links have to be considered and coordinated, being the backbone of the integrated approach; or as Ioan Fedor Pascu from Sighis¸ oara puts it: “It is insufficient to promote the preservation of the heritage if you do not integrate it in the sustainable development options for the benefit of the community.” Within the integrated approach also relevant sectoral policies, concepts and actions for the safeguarding and development of the historic urban area are coordinated and oriented towards a common vision and common objectives. Further, in the integrated approach cultural heritage is recognised as a cross-cutting and integrating theme as it is a unique feature and can be an important asset for the development of the area (heritage-led urban development). Its role as asset in support of a comprehensive, sustainable development to achieve liveable, attractive and competitive historic urban areas is to be elaborated: How can cultural heritage support the sustainable development of the area and how can the development be used to support the safeguarding of the cultural heritage? 
Benefits: Through the integrated approach frictions and conflicts between safeguarding the cultural heritage and related sectoral fields for the development of the area can be reduced. Also sectoral policies and actions that just shift a problem from one sector to another can be avoided. For example, design guides for the visual integrity of historic urban areas can help to properly preserve the view of historic buildings. Sometimes the regulations are just written from the preservation point of view, not taking into account the presentday requirements for liveable and attractive housing. This can lead to conflicts with property owners and a disrespect of the cultural heritage values. The integrated approach would require writing a design guide which tries to consider all the relevant aspects, demonstrating for example solutions which respect both the preservation demands and the demands for attractive housing. Further, through the integrated approach policies, concepts, objectives and actions can be coordinated towards a common goal to use synergy effects and avoid having their effects contradict each other. For example, when historic buildings are restored, the project can be used to train and qualify young people in that field who seek a job; thus obtaining qualified workers for the future rehabilitation of historic buildings. The involvement of other governmental bodies through the integrated approach also brings the chance to foster their awareness about both the cultural heritage demands and their development potentials in the field of work they are responsible for and how to take them into consideration for future activities (other departments think and make use of cultural heritage). Last but not least, the integrated approach helps the people in charge of safeguarding and developing a cultural heritage site to coordinate their work with the work of other stakeholders, which they affect or are affected by. Thus, the integrated approach supports the protection of cultural heritage assets and the sustainable development of historic urban areas whilst respecting the social and economic interests of its stakeholders; or as Ioan Fedor Pascu from Sighis¸ oara puts it: “An integrated approach and sustainability are essential pillars and at the same time conditions for a sustainable cultural heritage management plan”. 
3.1.2 Participative and communicative. 
There are manifold demands of residents, visitors, businesses and others on historic urban areas which have to be coordinated and balanced for a sustainable urban development in accordance with the cultural heritage values. Examples for demands are: An increasing number of tourists demands more space for hotels, pensions and gift shops provoking the replacement of housing space and daily goods retail stores. The property and capital market demands increasing revenues which can lead to out-of-scale buildings unsuitable to the historic urban structure. The pressure to introduce largescale floor space for commerce, retail and services challenges the small scale structure often found in historic urban areas. Shop owners demand exhibition space in front of the shop or big windows to present their products, which challenges the visual integrity of historic buildings or constrains the mobility of citizens passing by. This requires a direct dialogue with and among the stakeholders – as local experts and as parties concerned – to coordinate their demands among each other and bring them in line with the safeguarding of the cultural heritage. Thus, the participative approach demands involving relevant stakeholders in the development and implementation of the integrated strategy for the safeguarding and development of the historic urban area, developing a conjoint vision and conjoint objectives and actions. 
Benefits: Through the participative approach the Integrated Cultural Heritage Management Plan brings the relevant stakeholders together allowing them a. to recognise and understand each others needs, b. to develop sustainable solutions closer to these needs and c. to balance and coordinate the needs among the stakeholders and bring them in line with the requirements to safeguard the cultural heritage assets. It also supports an increase of the stakeholder’s understanding, respect and care for the value, demands and benefits of cultural heritage for sustainable urban development. The common elaboration of a strategy for the safeguarding and sustainable development of the historic urban area will also lead to a stronger identification with the vision, objectives and actions for the area and stronger support for their implementation („feeling of ownership“: a person is more willing to support something when being involved in its development). To a certain extent this can help to tap further (private) resources (man power, knowledge and finances) for the implementation of the actions. 
3.1.3 Management.
 The implementation and compliance of policies and actions in support of the safeguarding of the cultural heritage and the management of the different needs, demands not only actions. It also demands applicable procedures and structures of coordination, decision-making and monitoring for the daily work routine, continuously dealing with and improving the safeguarding and development of historic urban areas. For example, it requires structures which determine the organisations responsible for the safeguarding of the cultural heritage or procedures to identify (possible) threats to the cultural heritage at an early stage. Thus, within the management approach such procedures and structures for an effective management of safeguarding and developing historic urban areas are defined. The management approach contains a management and monitoring system to assess, improve and adapt the strategy in a continual improvement process (Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle) to respond to new emerging needs and challenges. It defines mechanisms of interaction among relevant institutions, governmental departments, non-governmental institutions, owners of heritage objects and further stakeholders in managing the historic urban area and safeguarding the qualities of the cultural heritage. Benefits: The management system facilitates dealing continuously with the enhancement of historic urban areas and their cultural heritage in the daily work routine. It allows coordinating demands and projects with other stakeholders towards the needs of the cultural heritage and keeping the strategy upto- date to new needs and challenges. It supports effectively managing the sustainable safeguarding of the cultural heritage with the future-oriented development of the area, ensuring that the special qualities of historic urban areas are sustained and preserved for future generations. 
3.1.4 Target and implementation oriented. 
The effective management of historic urban areas needs more than basic rules and procedures to be able to induce the desired development. Thus, the target and implementation oriented approach aims at developing a common vision, coordinated objectives and implementable actions in favour of the safeguarding and sustainable development of the heritage site. The target and implementation oriented approach implies deriving actions, which directly support the objectives conjointly agreed on, which in turn support the vision for the historic urban area. Vision, objectives and actions aim at balancing the demands of safeguarding the cultural heritage assets and the needs of stakeholders using and living in the historic urban area. Benefits: A common vision and coordinated objectives provide guidance and a proactive framework to the relevant stakeholders on which way to act and to develop and safeguard the historic urban area. The actions demonstrate with which activities the objectives will be reached to induce and influence the development of the historic urban area towards the common vision. For the application of the target and implementation oriented approach within the production of an Integrated Cultural Heritage Management Plan cf. 4.2.2. A strategy for historic urban areas, applying these four features will help to deal with and successfully manage the manifold demands of and towards historic urban areas, ensuring both the safeguarding of the cultural heritage for present and future generations and the development of attractive multifunctional historic urban areas for all the different stakeholders. 
3.2 Integrated Cultural Heritage Management Plans. 
Integrated Cultural Heritage Management Plans – as introduced by the HerO network – are one instrument to apply the features of the new management approach for historic urban areas. Integrated Cultural Heritage Management Plans present in this way an innovative instrument to effectively manage the sustainable safeguarding and development of historic urban areas and their cultural heritage with the intention to have attractive, competitive and multifunctional places. They coordinate the demands of the cultural heritage with the demands of the manifold “users” of the historic urban area and those of the governmental bodies in charge; or as John Hinchliffe from Liverpool puts it: “The fundamental purpose of an Integrated Cultural Heritage Management Plan is to safeguard cultural heritage for the benefit of local stakeholders”. Thus, an Integrated Cultural Heritage Management Plan determines and establishes the appropriate strategy, objectives, actions and management structure to safeguard the cultural heritage and to balance the different demands while using historic urban areas and their cultural heritage as a significant development asset. So Integrated Cultural Heritage Management Plans present a valuable tool for any historic town, including those which are World Heritage sites as UNESCO’s Guidelines for the Implementation of the World Heritage Convention (2008) require that every World Heritage site should have an appropriate management plan (or other documented management system) which should specify how the outstanding universal value of the area should be preserved, preferably through participatory means. The purpose of these management systems or plans is to ensure the effective protection of the World Heritage site for present and future generations. In most cases, the ideal management system for World Heritage sites will be in the form of an Integrated Cultural Heritage Management Plan. 
5 SUMMARY. 
The safeguarding of cultural heritage can provide an important stimulus for the sustainable development of historic towns and cultural heritage sites (cf. chapter 2). In order to achieve this, the safeguarding of the cultural heritage has to be linked with the economic, social and environmental development of the area, working out how the cultural heritage can support the sustainable urban development and how the development can be used to support the safeguarding of the cultural heritage. Successful application of this strategy will lead to attractive, competitive and multifunctional historic urban areas, in which inhabitants, tourists and business like to live, work and spend time, respecting and appreciating the cultural heritage values of the area. To successfully develop such a strategy – based on the experience of the HerO network – four main approaches have to be followed: A. The integrated approach linking, balancing and coordinating the safeguarding of the cultural heritage with further issues and fields of action, which are affecting or interacting with the safeguarding and development of the cultural heritage (cf. 3.1.1); B. The participative and communicative approach involving the relevant stakeholders in the development and implementation of the strategy to achieve their identification and compliance with its contents (cf. 3.1.2); C. The management approach to secure a continuous caring and improvement of the safeguarding and development of the cultural heritage site based on the demands of the cultural heritage and its users (cf. 3.1.3); D. The target and implementation oriented approach to provide guidance and a proactive framework to the municipality and relevant (private) stakeholders for the safeguarding and development of the cultural heritage site (cf. 3.1.4). Within the strategy the cultural heritage is recognised as a unique asset and a cross-cutting theme for the development of an attractive, competitive and multifunctional historic town (cultural heritage led urban development). One instrument that is helpful in applying these approaches and developing such a strategy is an Integrated Cultural Heritage Management Plan. They define a management system and action plan which seeks to achieve an appropriate and equitable balance between safeguarding and development so that historic urban areas and cultural heritage can be safeguarded through appropriate activities contributing to the social and economic development and quality of life in the city. For the successful application of Integrated Cultural Heritage Management Plans one crucial step is their comprehensive preparation before developing their contents. Crucial elements of this step are to build up a local support group for the development and implementation of the management plan (cf. 4.1.1); analyse the current situation of the cultural heritage site by identifying challenges, opportunities and the demand for actions due to the needs and conflicting interests of the cultural heritage and its users (cf. 4.1.2); develop a road map clarifying the objectives and issues to be addressed in the management plan and how the process of developing the management plan involving relevant stakeholders will be structured (cf. 4.1.3); secure the political and financial support for the production process (cf. 4.1.4). To allow the benefits of the four approaches mentioned above to come into effect, Integrated Cultural Heritage Management Plans contain the following main components for the safeguarding and development of the cultural heritage site, which are elaborated during the development phase together with the local support group and further stakeholders (cf. 4.2.1; implementation of the participative approach): concrete objectives and actions based on the identified challenges, opportunities and needs of the cultural heritage and its users to provide guidance and a proactive framework to the municipality and relevant (private) stakeholders for the development of that area (cf. 4.2.2; implementation of the target and implementation oriented approach); instruments, structures and procedures of coordination and decision-making for the daily work routine to ensure that decisions taken comply with and support the objectives of the management plan and the safeguarding of the cultural heritage site (cf. 4.2.3; implementation of the management approach); monitoring system to observe the state of the cultural heritage and the development of the cultural heritage site, in order to recognise at an early stage the demand for action due to problematic trends as well as new challenges and demands for the cultural heritage site (cf. 4.3.2; implementation of the management approach); review procedure to keep the management plan a helpful and up to date instrument for the safeguarding and development of a cultural heritage site. Thus, the management plan determines a responsible institution and procedure for the review and adaptation of its contents at regular intervals based on the monitoring results (cf. 4.3.3; implementation of the management approach). The production of an Integrated Cultural Heritage Management Plan is a complex procedure as relevant stakeholders and sector policies have to be involved and coordinated. Nevertheless the effort is worth the endeavour as the thorough production of an Integrated Cultural Heritage Management Plan will support the capitalisation of cultural heritage for the benefit of the urban development (cf. chapter 2) and effectively manage the safeguarding of the cultural heritage with the future-oriented development of the area, ensuring that the special qualities of the cultural heritage are sustained and preserved for future generations. Integrated Cultural Heritage Management Plans in catchwords: Guiding principles and approaches 1. Combine the safeguarding of the cultural heritage with the economic, social and environmental development of the area; 2. Strive for multifunctional historic urban areas which satisfy and balance the demands of its users; 3. Coordinate and manage the demands and conflicting interests of the stakeholders among each other and with the demands of the cultural heritage; 4. Apply the integrated approach linking and coordinating the cultural heritage with related sectoral fields (cf. 3.1.1) 5. Apply the participative approach by involving relevant stakeholders and promoting “cultural heritage for all” (cf. 3.1.2 and 4.2.1); 6. Apply the management approach establishing procedures and structures of coordination, decision- making and monitoring to implement a continual improvement process (cf. 3.1.3 and 4.2.3, 4.3.2 and 4.3.3); 7. Apply the target and implementation oriented approach by developing concrete objectives and actions for the cultural heritage site or the historic urban area (cf. 3.1.4 and 4.2.2); 8. Integrate the Integrated Cultural Heritage Management Plan in the main policy framework; 9. Take into account tangible and intangible cultural heritage assets;

"HOPUS.
Housing for Europe.
Strategies for Quality in Urban Space, Excellence in Design, Performance in Building.
The challenge set out by the Leipzig Charter may seem vast; nevertheless, it is only through joint efforts that we can truly aspire to better new housing developments – good, green, safe, and affordable – which will eventually give birth to the cities we want for the future of our continent. Hopus Group brings together five universities and one city administration, each working on different aspects of housing: from the urban to the building approach, from building regulations to construction technology, from environmental quality to energy certification: a multi-faceted and interdisciplinary vision, trying to cover a wide range of different problems, joining theory and practice.
1. Governance.
In order to be successfully implemented, urban governance requires a number of basic conditions: firstly, a mutual trust between public and private, between citizens and government. Governance implies true participation of stakeholders at all levels, and consultations are needed to assess the needs of everyone involved. In some contexts, this participatory process is not well seen, since in the face of new ideas of urban democracy the city’s government is still a “top-down” process.
Furthermore, a balanced power relationship between local authorities and private investors is needed: in housing development, governance can be impaired by builders who exercise strong economic pressures on the city, and are therefore in the position to strongly influence the outcomes, imposing solutions which are based on profit maximisation only. In some contexts, public limitation to private undertaking is negatively perceived.
 
2. Design coding and guidelines on housing.
Regulations, if drafted and applied in the wrong way, can stifle innovation, force architectural expression and produce monotonous outcomes by reducing possibilities, complicate bureaucratic processes and, in some extreme cases, even lead to illegal building activity. The aims of design coding are exactly the opposite: to speed up and guarantee the outcomes of the process by providing a shared document for both private developers and local authorities, who should use the codes to assess submitted designs.
 
3. Definition of quality standards for urban and architectural design in housing developments.
Being based on quantifiable parameters, environmental efficiency can be quite easily measured, in terms of energy consumption, heating and cooling costs, water recovery, LCA, etc. Urban and architectural quality is more elusive, and, to promote it, it must become a shared and transparent factor, no longer pertaining to specialists only, but to the wider public also. End-users should be fully informed of what they are buying, no less than when they buy produce or meat.
1. Governance.
Since design coding is a governance tool, it is likely that its implementation could only be feasible in contexts where urban governance is already an established way. One of the tasks of Hopus will therefore be that of outlining the basic governance conditions which need to be in place in order to attempt the implementation of design coding.

2. Design coding and guidelines on housing.
Another task for Hopus will therefore consist in surveying how design coding and similar forms of project guidance have been successfully or unsuccessfully applied throughout Europe. This will take in special consideration the process through which the implementation has taken place, in order to form a critical understanding of the advantages and disadvantages which design codes actually present.

3. Definition of quality standards for urban and architectural design in housing developments.
A further task which Hopus could thus set itself is to outline a system of European urban and architectural quality labelling for housing developments. This should take in consideration sustainability standards, but also specific parameters bound to standards of good urban and architectural design, variable depending on local contexts and understanding of quality.
What are the reasons which led to the birth of the Hopus project?
In 2007, the municipality of Rome gave CITERA - Faculty of Architecture ""Valle Giulia"", the opportunity to study in detail the factors and processes that determine the quality of urban housing. About twenty researchers at developed a code of practice for new public housing developments in Rome. The goal is to provide private construction contractors with a document that imposes the quality standards to be respected and that gives recommendations. It is an innovative project, not only for Italy, but also for Europe, where these types of guidelines have only been limited to isolated initiatives. Through Hopus, it will be possible to investigate the use of design codes and other forms of ""smart"" project guidance as they have been implemented in Europe. Which is the European added value in a working group like Hopus?
It is really fascinating to be able to compare the work and research done in different countries. Based on the observation that the idea of quality differs with one’s culture, Hopus focuses on the beginning of the development process, notably on governance and mechanisms to get private businesses adopt design codes. One of the main hesitations developers have is the fear that construction will cost more: in order to provide them with tangible benefits, Hopus is working on a quality labelling systems. The goal is for the buyer to be able to refer to precise criteria that guarantee quality.
European Cities: A Brighter Urban Future? 
The history of Europe is a history of cities: these are the places where everything took place, arts and inventions, philosophy and trade, wars and revolutions. They are the very embodiment of European culture, and have played this crucial role for centuries. For a long time they have also been the designated place of beauty: beautiful places where monuments and cathedrals acted together with ordinary houses, giving life to amazing streets and squares where people lived and thrived. Even the 20th century, with its convulse history of splendor and destruction, saw cities flourish and grow. But while planners and architects were inventing new ways to build and experience urban space, something else was happening: for the first time, cities were growing out of control, becoming large and complex conglomerations where true urban space was absent, the environment was heavily damaged, and which were very difficult to govern. 
This is our European urban present, a mixed-feeling situation where our extraordinary city cores are surrounded by anonymous city crowns, where quality goes from high to low, and beauty has often left the ground. Is it possible to take action against this urban decadence, imagining innovative ways to build and govern the city, allowing both new developments and the transformation of the existing to achieve a high quality? Does a European urban tradition still exist? Will Europe be able to strive for the aims of the Leipzig Charter, which calls for our cities to be the driving force behind our future? 
Housing lies at the heart of urban space, and our project studied the ways in which good residential design can lead to the creation of a good city and vice-versa. There are few things as tightly connected to local culture as dwelling, while at the same time referring to universal matters embodied in human beings. In some ways, understanding this double nature of housing means capturing the very problems of a large, diversified community such as Europe, constantly seeking a balance between what is common to everyone and what is specific to each person. We know that Europe aims to be the place of differences, a community of cultures and people who have joined forces to move together in one direction and learn from each other. The cities in our continent well represent this: different traditions, different ways of building urban space, some successful, others less so, but with a common intention to improve what we have now. The will and ability to learn and understand is the greatest enrichment which different – and at times very distant – realities can gain from each other. This is what our Hopus project has been all about: understanding. There is no way we can transport a good urban practice as it is from one place to the other: for cities are made of people and places, and you cannot change either as if by sheer magic. But we can understand the logic behind this good practice, and try to devise a gradual change in our own way of doing things, interpreting what has been done somewhere else in the light of our local reality. 
What the Hopus project has been capable of understanding is that there are, today, good ways of building the city, of designing housing, of achieving a sustainable urban development through intelligent construction. But the overarching problem is that of merging the general with the specific, the universal with the local: a problem which has so far hindered Europe from truly taking action in this direction, since it could, in doing so, betray its very nature of harboring difference and specificity. It is no easy task, and the road ahead promises unparalleled complexity. Nevertheless action must be taken, and the Leipzig Charter was a first, important step in this direction: it is the promise of a brighter urban future for Europe, and its coming implementation, in the hope that it will be as far-ranging as possible, is a challenge we must all contribute to winning. 


BHC and HOPUS: healthy and sustainable cities.
Lifestyles 
The way in which citizens live their lives is in great part influenced by the possibility to catch different opportunities, to maintain or improve certain levels of daily existence, to choose among possibilities. On the contrary, the lack of these basic citizenship conditions produce and reproduce disadvantaged people and areas and strengthen the stigmatisation of certain situations, making it almost impossible to overcome a difficult moment in everyone’s life, to access to some opportunities no matter the place in which we live, to improve living conditions so to contribute to the general wellbeing. 
Cities are by definition the first level of policy-making for citizens’ wellbeing and their capacity to design equal development strategies is directly linked to their capacity to include health and quality of life in all their policies and to design them as inclusive policies. 
The Leipzig Charter (2007) – which we may consider as the ultimate document on European cities that have been produced and approved by the EU – states that “all dimensions of sustainable development should be taken into account at the same time and with the same weight. These include economic prosperity, social balance and a healthy environment. At the same time attention should be paid to cultural and health aspects” (p. 1). Everything seems to fit into this statement and its fairness is evident, also its relevance to lifestyle is clear, since economic, social, environmental, cultural and health goals determine life conditions and lifestyle choices completely. 
2. 
Cooperation 
Cities alone cannot tackle the problems that equal opportunities bear, especially in times in which the economic and financial global crisis has narrowed the mar- gins for action at all levels. Yet cities can become the place where innovative ways of facing problems can be experimented and hopefully translated in good practices to be shared. This process cannot be done by cities alone or, in the best cases, by networks of cities, but a cooperation is needed upwards, with the regions, the national and the EU level, and downwards, with public and private actors that operate in the city. The cooperation process among different actors is already a reality in European cities and BHC is not an exception: agreements with private economic actors or the managing authorities of the Structural Funds define the strength and universality of welfare policies since at least the Nine- ties. The involvement of the different partners should be foreseen since the definition of strategies and policies, since local public authorities have seldom the capacity to carry on a public policy only with internal resources. Since the white paper “European Governance” (2001) the European Commission has stressed the role of new forms of cooperation among different actors in the Union scenario, and cities have played a big part in redesigning the institutional framework. Still some practices have not been fully analysed, as in the case of cooperation to improve health and quality of life conditions in cities, so making it necessary to advance in this field.
Knowledge 
This keyword is clearly related to the third WHO recommendation and is linked to a wider debate that is present at the European level (for instance in DG SANCO’s documents and analysis). Much of the efforts have been directed to improve the knowledge-based capacity of cities in relation to health and quality of life conditions. In the BHC project the knowledge process has been considered as a process that could be easily adapted to each different context in order to monitor specific situations or to select markers able to address certain policies in a way or another. The result of this ongoing process is a toolkit that will neither substitute nor reproduce any existing instrument but tries to provide a first-step toolkit to influence local policies and actions so to take into account health and quality of life for all citizens. 
A toolkit on urban health indicators.
 Urban Health Indicators can be used to harmonize criteria on how to measure environmental health issues, to monitor environmental health policies and programmes, to facilitate the systematic exchange of information be- tween countries, to forecast trends, to facilitate the identification of risk factors, to measure the impact and effectiveness of interventions or policies. Indicators can provide a basis for assessing the impact of a project, a change, a programme within a major urban regeneration plan on health and well being of the citizens in that urban area. They can act as a basis for monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of a project, a change, a programme within a major urban regeneration plan on reducing health and well being risks on the citizens in that urban area. Indicators can, eventually, provide a template for developing other indicators as needed to address is- sues of specific local concerns. Among the different indicators that have been selected from BHC partners, there are some that directly refers to the quality of public spaces, of the urban environment and of living conditions in cities. They have been grouped according to their mainly economic, social or environmental characterization and are presented in the following table. This selection from the bigger tool- kit (presented in BHC first thematic report) takes into account that different issues matter in different places and provide a first set of possible measure of the health of our cities.

Smart Specialisation at City Level
InFocus final report

A pioneering enquiry on the role of cities in smart specialisation
Smart specialisation and its subsequent method known as Research and Innovation Strategies for Smart Specialisation (RIS3) have been assessed as “the most comprehensive industrial policy experience being implemented in contemporary Europe”. In a nutshell, the concept can be seen as an innovation-oriented policy-mix on economic development with a focus on a short range of priority areas, which is governed in a collaborative (and entrepreneurial) way.
Within this new policy framework and within the URBACT Programme, the city of Bilbao (ES) promoted the InFocus network, in collaboration with Bielsko-Biala (PL), Bordeaux Métropole (FR), Bucharest-3rd district (RO), Frankfurt (GE), Grenoble-Alpes Métropole (FR), Ostrava (CZ), Plasencia (ES), Porto (PO) and the Metropolitan City of Torino (IT). It was born to contribute, from the city perspective, to both the smart specialisation concept and the RIS3 method, pursuing a twofold goal.

First, testing the smart specialization approach as a driver to re-invigorate the work cities and their stakeholders are doing (or can do) in local economic development. To that aim, we de-constructed the urban and metropolitan agenda on business-led economic development in four main pillars: cluster development, entrepreneurship, space provision and attraction of investment and knowledge. A kind of essential policy-mix.

Secondly, building a bridge with the ongoing RIS3 strategies that are displayed at regional level. Many recognize that the role of major cities in the processes that have led to the different RIS3 formulations across the EU has been quite superficial. Let´s say it has been closer to a conventional public consultation logic rather than real co-production. Now, at the crucial time of RIS3 implementation, many local and metropolitan authorities feel they have much to contribute in taking those visions and roadmaps forward.
In this prospect, the four main horizontal policies above mentioned have been addressed as connectors to regional RIS3 and source for a genuine contribution from (major) cities to RIS3. For instance, inward investment and talent attraction are very dynamic work areas at city level, much more than at regional/country level. They could benefit from the focus and direction provided by S3 roadmaps, and vice-versa, regional RIS3 should take advantage of the city´s know-how in branding and marketing itself as business and innovation ecosystem. The same with regard to the numerous local initiatives aimed at shaping new spaces for innovation and work. In short, this is simply a matter of vertical multi-level governance and not about reproducing RIS3 at local level.
It´s a timely issue indeed, since the debate on how to embed smart specialisation into the territory is now open. In fact, the engine force of the InFocus experience has been turning cities into RIS3 key actors, at least those major cities with a significant background in economic development and innovation policies.
Furthermore, tackling the challenge of a more effective city-to-region articulation with regard to smart specialisation will raise the status of local and metropolitan authorities as innovation and industrial policy-makers, which makes full sense giving the main role major cities play in today´s global competition.

This enquiry was shaped as an action planning network involving the ten cities in a joint work plan that have included a six-month preparatory phase, five international thematic workshops plus a formal peer-review exercise.
Such a large-scale peer-learning was designed to feed a sound work at local level that has mobilized over 200 key stakeholders and crystallized in the production of an Integrated Action Plan in each of the participating cities. That´s the URBACT framework, as this European Programme is defined by three key aspects: i) it´s about cities working together to build innovative solutions to common challenges; ii) it works with all parties who have a stake in the city: the so-called URBACT Local Groups; iii) and it is a result-oriented programme.
After 30 months of intensive peer learning and exchange, InFocus has definitely pioneered on how the policy concept of smart specialisation applies to the city. Never before, no transnational initiative had addressed this issue so systematically. It therefore paves the way to other cities trying to examine how S3 can work as a driver to re-think the urban agenda on economic development.

Two key messages can be highlighted from this action-research project. The first is about the need for cities to place innovation at the core of their economic agendas, where smart specialisation can play a primary instrumental role, as a cohesive force giving more consistency to the policy-mix on economic development. Second message is on the need for policymaking and governance more open to co-production and exposed to experimentation.
Furthermore, the InFocus experience provides a path for those regional teams who are leading the implementation of the different RIS3 underway and feel the need to embed those strategies into the territory as much as possible. All regional RIS3 involved in this experience, ranging from RIS3-Basque Country and RIS3-Extremadura to RIS3-Piemonte and RIS3-Silesia, are now stronger thanks to the Local Action Plans produced by the InFocus partners cities. At least, a specific dialogue has been initiated between those RIS3 leading teams and the city/metropolitan authorities (or their subsidiaries on innovation and economic development).

Ultimately, the initiative has raised a number of questions of interest for practitioners working at both regional and local levels:
 At the time of RIS3 implementation, all efforts, at different scales, must be activated. How to operationalise the city as RIS3 developer?
 What is the urban dimension of smart specialisation?
 Are Regional Authorities aware of the potential role of cities as S3 key actors? How to raise this awareness?
 In which way S3/RIS3 can boost or influence the urban agenda on economic development?
 To what extent a smooth articulation with RIS3 at regional level might be an accelerator for local economic development?
 In this regard, How could local authorities´ motivation be ignited or stimulated?
 To what extent S3 can be a catalyst to increase a more efficient multi-level governance, beyond research and innovation? Could smart specialisation work as a driver for territorial development?

At this point, it is worth noting a significant communication gap with regard to smart specialization. It even affects to main stakeholders in the field of innovation and business development. Generally speaking, outside the relatively small circle of practitioners and experts more closely related to RIS3, who sometimes seem unable to go beyond their own jargon, the level of understanding of smart specialisation is still poor. And this is certainly a barrier to implement and embed RIS3 properly over the ground. Consequently, there is much to do by the S3 leading authorities in the field of communications and awareness rising.

The emergence of smart specialization as a policy concept.
The concept of smart specialisation emerges as a main outcome of the discussion promoted by the European Commission between 2008 and 2011 in order to tackle the persistent innovation and productivity gap with the US - the so called “transatlantic productivity gap”. Another engine driver was the determination to reorient the Structural Funds (mostly ERDF and its related OPs) from physical infrastructure investment to knowledge and innovation-based investment. To that aim, the Commission created the expert group “Knowledge for Growth”, where Professor Dominique Foray, from the Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, served as chairman. It was during his appointment as member of this Group that he developed the concept of smart specialisation.
This discussion capitalized on the EU background in innovation policies that was initiated in 1994 through the so-called Regional Innovation Strategies (RIS), which emphasized the ecosystem approach and stakeholder involvement. This time two additional elements were added: the value of prioritizing (of making smart choices) as starting point, and how to do it through an inclusive, bottom-up and permanent process called now “entrepreneurial discovery”, emphasizing the role of research centres, universities, leading firms and entrepreneurs. It quickly led to a new generation of the RIS method called Research and Innovation Strategies for Smart Specialisation (RIS3).
That is how the concept of smart specialisation emerges as a pillar of the EU Cohesion Policy, which is based on the principles of smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. So, for the programming period 2014-2020, member states and their regions were required by Brussels “to set priorities in order to build competitive advantage by developing and matching research and innovation own strengths to business needs in order to address emerging opportunities and market developments in a coherent manner, while avoiding duplication and fragmentation of efforts”5.

Three key values are closely linked to the smart specialisation concept.
 Choice. The value of prioritizing a number of productive/knowledge domains (vertical priorities, which can be assembled as a “specialisation pattern”) and the subsequent alignment of horizontal policies and initiatives around them.
Related variety. Priorities are just the backbone for the “specialized diversification”, which is the real key concept. In exploiting related diversity and relationships between the different priority areas new opportunities and activities might emerge. In other words, it is about to fully activate the potential of a range of core competences and knowledge and sectoral specialisations, expanding them to other value chains and sectors. In this context, approaches like cross-sector innovation and sector hybridisation can be instrumental.
 Collaborative leadership. It´s about mobilizing stakeholders from the triple or quadruple helix to jointly prioritize and explore opportunities, which is named “entrepreneurial discovery process”. In this framework, entrepreneurial means getting focused on market opportunities and responding to major challenges (e.g. ageing population, climate change, digital transformation…).
This should be extended to a new style of co-producing policies and initiatives in the field of innovation and economic development. As Bilbao Ekintza Director Nora Sarasola said at the InFocus thematic workshop in Ostrava, leadership should be now understood as “the capacity of taking the initiative to manage, convene, promote, encourage and generate consensus”.

The unsolved question related to the city.
Since RIS3 was fixed as an ex-ante conditionality for regions and member states to get ERDF funding for their Operational Programmes on innovation in the programming period 2014-2020, smart specialization and some related concepts like the aforementioned entrepreneurial discovery process (EDP) have entered the mainstream vocabulary in innovation and industrial policies.
However, since the planning phase (what happened under a good deal of time pressure, mainly since 2011 to 2015), a gap has emerged. It has to do with the articulation of those regional strategies for smart specialisation to the local level. In particular with those cities with a meaningful background in economic development, or cities with remarkable transformation agendas underway.
Generally speaking, the participation of cities in RIS3 designs (we mean local/metropolitan authorities and their relevant subsidiaries working on economic development) has been mostly superficial so far. This has been the assessment of most InFocus partners. For instance, officers from Grenoble-Alpes Metropole say “the Metropolis was asked to participate during the elaboration process [of RIS3], but just from a public information perspective rather than a real co-production approach”.
As a result, the idea of smart specialisation is barely assimilated at local level, which is a significant gap given the undeniable role of mayor cities as key actors in the world economy, in particular in the global circulation of innovations. Furthermore, it seems the smart specialisation approach fits well to the needs from modern urban economies. A widely publicized report of the Brookings Institution concludes that one of the ten traits of globally fluent metro areas is “specialisations with global reach”, meaning that cities often establish their initial global position through a distinct economic specialization, leveraging it as a platform for diversification.

This gap can be seen as part of the growth process of a new method. A first explanation comes from the early literature on smart specialisation and its transposition to the regional policy in the EU, where the question of scale has been mostly addressed as a matter of the right scale (largely the regional one) and at much lesser extent as interactions between scales. In any case, with regard to policymaking, when addressing the question of scale interaction, the focus has been on inter-regional coordination (notably country-region coordination) much more than city/region linkages.
At linking RIS3 to Structural Funds access, basically via Operational Programmes, automatically the NUT2 level has been privileged as the right scale to deal with the RIS3 method. This is a convention indeed, which may make sense anyway, as a matter of being operational, gaining critical mass and avoiding fragmentation. Nonetheless, the city has been totally absent from RIS3 guides, templates and discussion papers promoted or delivered by the European Commission for years. The very S3 Platform is cautious when targeting its ideal community of practitioners, warning at its website: “we strongly suggest you register at the most relevant territorial level with respect to the decision-making process on drafting innovation strategies and managing corresponding public funding tools”.

But now, at the implementation stage, a number of major cities offer great potential to collaborate in developing S3 over the ground, beyond their role as testbeds. It seems to be the right time for scale management, boosting relevant collaboration between regions and cities. Fortunately, the need for effective implementation has created a new framework where the issue of multi-level governance has seemingly been placed at the core. The RIS3 guide on implementation even includes a reference to the city level: “interaction and coordination between regions, territories and cities with regard to regional/national Smart Specialisation Strategies are required to avoid fragmentation and increase the impact of investments across Europe”.
However, in our view, the specific theme of the city as RIS3 actor is not yet visible enough. In other words, most practitioners agree it matters, but it has not been turned into an issue within the RIS3 agenda to tackle shortly.
It is worth noting the issue of city-to-region articulation regarding RIS3 matters especially in certain regional contexts and territorial settings. For instance, the Basque Country hosts three core urban economies (Bilbao, Donostia-San Sebastian and Vitoria-Gasteiz), each with a very different profile and work agenda on economic development. Hence, those urban economies would request a sort of “customized” relationship with RIS3-Basque Country, in order to properly embed that strategy locally.

Is the city ready to make most of smart specialisation?

Tackling the question of effective city-to-region alignment on smart specialisation will elevate the status of some innovative cities as industrial and innovation policymakers, which makes total sense given the main role major cities play in today´s global competition. Nevertheless, is the city ready to take full advantage of S3/RIS3? In this respect, we see two issues to bear in mind:
Motivation and (political) awareness. For many cities RIS3 has nothing to do with them. As mentioned above, that short-sighted view comes from the time of RIS3 elaboration, when many (major) cities were mostly approached for “light consultation”, instead of a real co-production aim. So, there is still much to do raising awareness on the meaning and potential impact of smart specialisation.
Adequate technical skills. According to Jan Vozab, principal at Prague-based consultant team Berman Group, smart specialisation type of roadmaps are “more difficult, uncertain and risky” than previous models in industrial and innovation policymaking. Just putting the idea of “related variety” into practice is not an easy task. It needs for excellent technical skills, including innovation economics, business intelligence and facilitation techniques.
It´s a fact that many practitioners involved in economic development find difficulties to fully understand the meaning and scope of smart specialisation as a policy concept, which seems to be somewhat constrained by its own jargon and method (RIS3). This evidence was got along many field trips at the InFocus experience, where even principal actors related to innovation and business development at the regional level did not believe so much in the real value for them of “yet another strategy” like RIS3. In this respect, greater communication effort should be done by the RIS3 leading authorities.
Bilbao is pioneering in making the smart specialisation approach work at city level. They are applying the entrepreneurial discovery method to engage the right pool of stakeholders in every focal area they have prioritized. Soon, they realized that such facilitator role, in a policy context more oriented to innovation and competitiveness, needed from new advanced skills. Consequently, an ad-hoc training programme has been designed targeting Bilbao Ekintza staff (the local development agency) more involved in delivering the new approach.

What it comes to the governing framework to make smart specialisation visions come true, perhaps it is simpler than the kind of “Schumpeterian” public administration that some from the academia may claim. In principle, getting good skilled people (with a bit of visionary touch) with the ability to work across different administrative levels and efforts could make a difference.
In this regard, South Moravian Region (CZ), which de facto works as Brno city-region, can be a reference, since they are becoming an international benchmark in innovation policy. Their brilliant results in climbing up the ranking of knowledge-based economies in Europe – e.g. regional GDP invested in R&D has moved from 1,4% in 2004 to 3,8% in 2014, 50% private R&D investment – is a combination of great motivation and professionalism of the team involved.
They have neither explicit competences over research and innovation nor EU Operational Programmes at regional level. That is, producing a RIS3 type of strategy was not any ex-ante conditionality in this case, since in the Czech Republic that conditionality only applied to the national level13. Even so, the current South Moravia Regional Innovation Strategy 2014-2020 (RIS-JMK) has been produced following the key principles of smart specialisation. It´s a long-term strategy that is managed on the day-to-day by JIC, the South Moravian Innovation Centre, which is a highly professionalized agency founded in 2003 – significantly JIC is an alliance of South Moravia region, the Statutory City of Brno and four Universities.
According to JIC officer Petr Chládek, Brno´s great achievements regarding innovation and competitiveness can be explained by the following success factors:
 “Strong, stable political commitment;
 keeping strategic focus and result-orientation (know what we want first, money comes next);
 best people on board, stability of intermediaries and their people;
 being constantly in the field (openness to new ideas from new actors);
 robust governance structures;
 being close to policy research (e.g. insights from the S3 Platform)”.
Certainly, working as a public manager in this way is a demanding task. In Chládek´s words, rather than a document or a process, this type of policymaking should be addressed as a “state of mind”.

Why re-thinking the urban agenda on economic development?
The answer is to make it more instrumental in the transition towards a real knowledge-based economy. Paving the way to the New Economy should draw the attention of middle-income and high-income cities and regions in order to sustain, or better achieve, their positioning into the world economy. And to a large extent this is an organisational matter. It has to do with how cities are organizing, fuelling and facilitating themselves as business and innovation ecosystems.
That´s the purpose of a local economic agenda. An in-depth research on the different evolution of Los Angeles and San Francisco, carried out by a team conducted by Michael Storper, concluded that these organizational arrangements increasingly matter to explain urban growth and urban stagnation.
It is not by chance that many of the cities involved in the InFocus experience are advanced practitioners in economic development. Some of them rank at top positions in international rankings on innovation and competitiveness. Those cities feel the need to refine the way they are promoting economic development, in order to accelerate their transition to the New Economy (digital-based economy, which is also driven by knowledge, innovation and creativity).
At this point, further to the need for more effective city to region articulation regarding the ongoing regional strategies for smart specialisation, the concept of smart specialisation (not necessarily connected to RIS3 method and jargon) is so powerful that can be addressed as a key driver to boost the urban agenda on business-led economic development, providing better focus.
An agenda that herein we have de-constructed into four key policies: cluster development, entrepreneurship, space provision and attraction of investment and talent.
Another answer to the question of why revisiting the local policy-mix on business-led economic development is to better contribute to RIS3 visions and roadmaps in place at regional level. Indeed, changing or just influencing the “strategic agenda from existing operators” is one of the main paths to move RIS3 from strategy into action (Gianelle et al 2016). When that existing operator is a major city with an extensive background in economic development, such a delivery channel is called to play a primary role.

Furthermore, well-developed working areas at city level, such as space provision or inward investment and talent attraction, cannot easily be found in many RIS3 designs at national/regional level. Taking them into account will result in the refinement of the horizontal policy-mix that is usually linked to RIS3. That is why the challenge of connecting RIS3 to the city should be understood as a two-way bridge.
In fact, the RIS3 method is seen as a sort of backbone to which a number of side policies and branches can be connected (Foray, D. et al 2012). An evolving tool that can be shaped according to the praxis. Indeed, as president of The Competitiveness Institute Christian Ketels said, smart specialisation is “a new policy concept to organize many existing (and a few new) policy tools”. We actually see smart specialisation as an organisational driver aimed to promote innovation-led growth.

Cluster-based local economic development in the context of smart specialisation
The cluster approach is likely the most influential one in modern industrial policy worldwide and the arrival of smart specialisation has even emphasized this influence. Put differently, smart specialisation has opened a window of opportunity for cluster policies to be revised and improved. So, how might local authorities take advantage of this momentum to enhance their role as promoters or facilitators of cluster initiatives? What new drivers are now working in the field of cluster development?

As a first assumption, it is worth noting that domains of smart specialisation or S3 priority areas are often different to clusters and cluster initiatives. The former usually are challenge-based and broader than clusters (advanced manufacturing, low-carbon economy…), while clusters are mostly configured as an assemblage of product/markets that are linked along specific value chains. S3 priority areas are more oriented to structural change, while cluster´s agendas are more centred on business growth.
Thus, ”the full potential of clusters and cluster policies will be reached if the smart specialisation strategies integrate cluster policies into a broader transformation agenda for the entire regional economy”. For instance, IT clusters are called to play a primary role to digital transformation, but S3 leading authorities along with cluster policymakers and cluster managers are who should unlock this transforming potential if necessary. That is why RIS3 is working (or should work) as a booster for cluster policies.

Spaces for smart specialisation
The new economy, still to shape, is promoting changes in the spaces of production and innovation. For instance, science and tech parks, which are commonly cited as RIS3 key actors in the literature on smart specialisation, are increasingly multi-functional and getting a more urban character. They are evolving towards urban innovation districts. The CBD concept (Central Business District) is now much more than a financial district and it welcomes other activities related to the digital and creative economy. University campuses are changing likewise, from spaces of just research & learning to host a wider variety of urban functions. A growing number of new company headquarters are inner city-located, by opposite to suburban corporate campuses.

Smart specialisation can no doubt be helpful in providing guidance to these new spatial trends and settings. For instance, in three ways:
Activity focus. Particularly, the idea of “specialisation pattern” may help to solve the specialisation/diversification dilemma that many managers of science and tech parks and other innovation spaces face. A specialisation pattern can be understood as a short range
of non-excluding core specialisations, which give character and distinctiveness to a space and create linkages to other activities that are welcome likewise.
On a surface of 740 hectares, Bordeaux-Euratlantique is as a major urban redevelopment project aimed at maximizing the impact of the new high speed train connection to Paris. To some extent, it´s an attempt to re-invent the CBD concept following a specialisation pattern that includes advanced tertiary, digital and creative economy, green growth and the wood sector (the area as a live showroom of Aquitaine-based capacities in wood solutions to sustainable construction).
Co-location. Bringing into the same location different industries with potential to mutually benefit in terms of cross-innovation or B2B – e.g. co-locating knowledge intensive services, IT and creative industries.
In relation to this, Bordeaux Métropole has committed to make the S3 idea of “related variety” work at Bordeaux´s three biggest urban projects now underway: the aforementioned Bordeaux-Euratlantique, Bordeaux Aeroparc (aerospace-defence) and Bordeaux Inno Campus (with a focus on health sciences, laser & photonics and other technologies). It means to consciously boost specific cross-sector innovation and co-location, as well as to manage those megaprojects in a way that they can be more exposed to experimentation.
For years Bordeaux has been providing spaces to cover specific needs from local clusters, resulting in a portfolio of cluster-focused business and tech parks, e.g. Aeroparc, Bioparc Bordeaux Métropole (health cluster), Ecoparc (cleantech), Cité de la Photonique (lasers & photonic). The ultimate project in this regard is The Digital City (Cité Numérique). Located in a former post office transit building, as part of Bordeaux Euratlantique, the Digital City is a good example of new urban workspaces, closely linked to the digital economy and in particular the cluster Pole Numérique Aquitaine.
In this context, the entrepreneurial discovery process might be extended beyond unveiling business and innovation opportunities, to get to know better the specific needs from a number of priority sectors in terms of location, architectural and interior design,etc. This would allow city units in charge of urban planning and local economic development to get their respective goals closer.
That´s the way Porto is now prospecting in order to maximize the urban economy impact of its two major urban projects: Campanhã (most likely, next most ambitious brownfield redevelopment in Portugal) and Asprela (the transformation of one of the University of Porto campuses into a urban innovation district).
Indeed, bringing both urban planning and economic development under the same general directorate and councillorship may explain (along with the metropolitan level as effective work scale) why Bordeaux is so good dealing with the new (urban) industrial space.

As primary spacemakers, many local and metropolitan authorities are promoting large-scale regeneration projects that might be addressed as unique testbeds for new work and innovation spaces. Therefore, testbeds for S3 type of visions and roadmaps. For example, Bilbao´s Zorrotzaurre project is called to be the biggest brownfield redevelopment in Spain in the years to come. Bilbao City Council has envisioned it as an urban innovation district, where multi-functionality will be its most remarkable feature - 85 Has. of which 75% residential and 25% devoted to economic activity, according to the master plan. Business location decisions concerning this area will be closely guided by both Basque Country RIS3 and Bilbao´s newly S3-driven economic agenda.

Branding and marketing the city as innovation ecosystem.
Increasingly cities devote more energies and resources to market themselves as great places to live, work and invest. Just considering the InFocus partnership, enhancing Porto´s attractiveness and visibility in the global arena was one of the main priorities of Mayor Rui Moreira, who set up Invest Porto in 2014 as a small, agile team to spread Porto´s value proposition worldwide. Mission Bordeaux Attractiveness was launched in 2017 by Bordeaux Métropole as a long-term strategy not jumping just into a logo/motto/campaign logic. Frankfurt took a giant step into inward investment attraction by organizing this work in a way that the same team and strategy is serving the whole metropolitan region Frankfurt Rhein-Main - an area of 5.8 million that stretches across three different Länders and including other major cities like Wiesbaden and Darmstadt. Ostrava, in the Czech Republic, has just launched in 2018 an ambitious strategy on talent attraction, targeting skilled workforce, researchers, students and creative people.
That´s the communication dimension of a modern local economic agenda. In this regard, how can smart specialization be helpful?

Indeed, the idea of smart specialisation has a significant outward-oriented dimension. The link to the outside is something that is emphasized by the RIS3 method - “this process is carried out with an eye on the outside world” (Foray et al, 2012). In fact, S3 was born as a response to the need for better positioning the EU regions in the global competition. That is why RIS3 should take advantage of the numerous city branding & marketing practices that are now underway targeting international audiences. Both types of strategies reinforce each other.
With regard to territorial economic development, innovation is not only related to the capacity to produce new knowledge locally, but also to absorb global innovations generated elsewhere. Therefore, the “anchor capacity” of cities and regions to attract investment and firms, knowledge and innovation, talented people… matters a lot. One can refer to this anchor capacity as attractiveness, which is a popular concept in France (attractivité), although it is used much less in the rest of Europe.
In this respect, S3 priority sectors and knowledge domains should work as linking pathways to the outer world. In other words, if well done, S3 can provide greater direction and much more precise focus for cities and regions marketing themselves as business location. For instance, Ostrava´s brand new strategy on talent attraction benefits from the techno-productive priority areas set at Moravian-Silesian RIS3 (from materials engineering to supercomputing methods). The latter works as an additional segmentation to Ostrava´s four main target groups (qualified labour force, innovative researchers, excellent students and the creative class). Such a crossed-segmentation may lead to higher quality performance of the marketing and attraction activities with no doubt.

City branding is an organizational challenge, a matter of stakeholder mobilization and alignment, notably those who often interact with international audiences. When branding and marketing the city as business environment, those stakeholders are no other than firms, startups, local innovators, higher education institutions, cluster initiatives, tech parks, etc. Sometimes, it is the private-sector which takes the lead to market the city to specific audiences. That´s the case of Porto Tech Hub, an initiative promoted by three Porto-based leading IT firms (Blip, Critical Software and Farfetch) aimed to give Porto more international visibility as innovation ecosystem.
Engaging the private sector makes a difference, but it can usually be a hard task. A fundamental question is therefore how to capture the attention of local firms, startups and innovators to involve them in marketing the city as business and innovation ecosystem. In this regard the entrepreneurial discovery method can be valuable not only to find out innovation pathways and business opportunities, but also to co-produce business-driven Invest-IN and talent management strategies.";"36.txt";"36"
"Interactive Cities 
Digital, Social Media and Generated-User Content Improving Urban Governance.  
State of the art. 
""There is a lot of power in people to self-organise around a specific issue and if they'd like to use technology to mobilise themselves, they should have the capability and the choice to do that.” Juliana Rotich, founder of Ushahidi, 2011 
Context 
With today's European cities hosting most of the continent’s population, and urban areas being the stage for many contemporary conflicts such as social inequality, environmental threats or economic crisis, collective action must be taken immediately. In the past years, there has been a lot of discussion about the potential role of smart technologies in addressing these problems. While an important part of the discourse on “smart cities” focuses on infrastructural investment, recent criticism of it underlines the importance of empowering smart citizens as part of developing smart cities. A smart city should improve the quality of life of its citizens and help them to react to urban challenges. The emergence of social media and various digital technologies are potential tools to empower both citizens and public administrations in creating new frameworks for multi-stakeholder collaboration and enhancing the information flow between different actors of European cities. Social media today is regularly used by a vast majority of the population, but in most cases this happens outside of a dialogue with the public sphere. As public institutions face a multiplicity of challenges and they are forced to reduce public expenses and augment efficiency, their success increasingly depends on the extent to which they engage and mobilise their residents in meaningful cooperation. Inspired by the higher liveability and sustainability of community-led developments and in contrast with the traditional top-down mechanisms of planning cities and providing services, public administrations are progressively looking into learning from local communities about their specific needs, incorporating bottom-up intelligence: citizens’ knowledge and insights are regarded as reliable data sources. The digital shift has opened new opportunities for cities to create dialogue with their citizens, residents and users. However, many cities are hesitant to adapt their communication and participation mechanisms to this shift: they are often too slow and bureaucratic to engage with technologies that were already widely deployed in their communities. The impact of new digital tools extends well beyond the technological sphere: they transform the way cities are governed, urban projects are managed, services are delivered, and participation is orchestrated. Social media has the potential to bridge the gap between public administrations and citizens, municipal agencies and community groups, service providers and users. Adding an inclusive dimension to the smart city paradigm, new communication platforms may foster cooperation and innovation within public administrations and outside: municipal operations may gain more visibility and legibility with the help of online platforms, while citizen feedback and user-generated data may support decision-making with the help of social media. The use of digital platforms also opens new perspectives for data management: on the one hand, the big data created through the citizens’ use of social media can give a real time picture of their opinions and perceptions of urban matters, and thus can inform planning and policy. On the other, transmitting city data through municipal platforms to users makes them able to use the data in applications, thus translating them and making them more accessible for the broader public. Social media and digital communication also reshape the discussion on de-territorialisation: while many observers warned that global connectivity and online communication might kill places and help global hegemonies replace local economies, social media and digital platforms also create the infrastructure for advanced peer-to-peer communication that enables responsible consumption patterns and local distribution networks. In this sense, digital communication does not only help individuals join the global information system, but also assists the emergence of locally rooted networks, as we see in many local social media groups, neighbourhood blogs, local digital platforms and chat rooms. 
Conclusions 
From tourism through business promotion, urban planning and social services to mobility, the presented digital platforms and tools represent a broad variety of approaches to urban problems and services. While some focus on singular issues, others link various themes, thus contributing with an interdisciplinary perspective to a more integrated management of resources, information and collaborations. Inspired by these practices and many more, the URBACT Action Planning Network Interactive Cities builds on local needs and capacities to use social media and to develop new tools for better urban collaborations. The cities involved in the Network look into the opportunities of using social media to improve the governance of urban spaces, resources and services. By launching new platforms, applications or channels to enhance communication between administration and citizens, the project aims to help participating cities develop a local ecosystem of social media-based tools in order to better respond to challenges. Interactive Cities will compare strategies adopted by different European cities in the use of social media for institutional communication, as well as the use of open datasets for the creation of urban apps made by independent developers or by the public authorities themselves. Highlighting the city as a hub for creative exchange of contents and information among people is one of the main objectives of the project which will start from the strategies currently adopted by the Network’s partners in order to make them more efficient. Interactive Cities aims to underline that the role of social media and digital tools in municipal communication is by no means limited to the transmission of messages by administrations. On the contrary, they potentially serve as bi-directional exchange channels, restructuring not only public communication but also the municipal governance models. Many of the platforms or digital tools that transform the way we live, experience, use and create cities are not initiated by local administrations but civic organisations, research institutions or private enterprises: however, they create important links between public, civic, academic and private stakeholders. The role of public administrations in this process is manifold: besides creating, commissioning or triggering, they also need to accommodate innovation and help all their partners in adapting to economic and social changes by redefining their digital strategies. This requires building up eco-systems of digital communication and knowledge exchange: in order to improve public services and create an innovative milieu with the help of incubators, open data platforms, sharing and exchanging tools, hackathons or competitions, administrations need to help urban actors establish their networks. Online involvement cannot replace offline cooperation though. In order to crowdsource citizen observations or connect initiatives, it is not enough just to establish digital platforms or online tools: engagement includes offline and online involvement, and often necessitates particular incentives to make community members contribute: “If people congregate around an issue, they will, in fact, create a community around that issue. The most successful deployments are the ones where people are congregating around an issue and have a channel for them to participate. Our insistence on partnership, and in particular on-the-ground partnership has become very important because context is everything. Geocontext helps, but the local understanding of the tech landscape, the political landscape, the cultural landscape is extremely important in the success of a deployment.” (Rotich 2011)  
#Synthesis 
Interactive Cities is a cutting-edge project aimed to explore how digital, social media and user generated content can improve today´s urban management in the European cities, no matter their size. And this challenge will be tackled in two ways. Firstly, as opportunity to redefine and deepen the concept of citizenship and civic engagement today, providing a path to spark cohesion, commonalities and shared value as well as increasing sense of place. In other words, making the most of the new channels to revisit the relation between the individual and the local community in the digital era. Secondly, as a way to improve the quality of public services, in terms of efficiency and transparency, and even widen the current service chart provided by the local authorities. The international cross-learning on this issue will be organized into three main sub-themes: i) Communicating a city as an attractive tourist destination strengthening its image both locally and internationally ii) communication of business promotion strengthening the city’s conditions through the support of local companies, both the existing ones and the potentially new ones iii) communicating urban development making understandable to a wide audience often very complex technical matters, balancing the involvement of inhabitants in the decision making process and explaining why plans have been approved by the administration. With today's European cities hosting most of the continent’s population, and urban areas being the stage for many contemporary conflicts such as social inequality, environmental threats or economic crisis, collective action must be taken immediately. In the past years, there has been a lot of discussion about the potential role of smart technologies in addressing these problems. While an important part of the discourse on “smart cities” focuses on infrastructural investment, recent criticism of it underlines the importance of empowering smart citizens as part of developing smart cities. A smart city should improve the quality of life of its citizens and help them to react to urban challenges. The emergence of social media and various digital technologies are potential tools to empower both citizens and public administrations in creating new frameworks for multi-stakeholder collaboration and enhancing the information flow between different actors of European cities. The use of social media, apps and data is contributing to better city governance all around the world and to improving the lives of billions of people. The revolutionary change in the system of relations among people brought by the rising importance of communication technologies, have significant effects also on the way urban residents expect that cities communicate to them. Recently, increasing numbers American and European cities have used digital communication tools to foster the interaction of residents in many different domains of urban life. The digital shift has opened new opportunities for cities to create dialogue with their citizens, residents and users. However, many cities are hesitant to adapt their communication and participation mechanisms to this shift: they are often too slow and bureaucratic to engage with technologies that were already widely deployed in their communities. The impact of new digital tools extends well beyond the technological sphere: they transform the way cities are governed, urban projects are managed, services are delivered, and participation is orchestrated. Social media has the potential to bridge the gap between public administrations and citizens, municipal agencies and community groups, service providers and users.

This requires building up eco-systems of digital communication and knowledge exchange: in order to improve public services and create an innovative milieu with the help of incubators, open data platforms, sharing and exchanging tools, hackathons or competitions, administrations need to help urban actors establish their networks. 
Approaches 
The Interactive Cities partners have expressed a variety of approaches to the broad theme of digital communication to improve the governance of our cities. These can be synthesised into two main trends: one foreseeing an outward communication, such as marketing and promotion; and an inward communication, such as participation and inclusion. Even though no communication is a one way road, we see that due to the local needs and the specific profiles of the city departments directly involved in the project, there is this main difference. Some cities are interested in developing a communication strategy that will help position the city and their local stakeholders on an international or even city-wide map. For example, when wanting to market the tourism attractions of Varna or when wanting to promote the engineering companies in Debrecen, it will be necessary to develop a branding strategy in collaboration with the local stakeholders in order to really sustain it. On the other hand when wanting to include the citizens of the Lisbon Community-Led Local Development (CLLD) or when wanting to gather feedback from citizens within the public services of Tartu, it will be necessary to enhance the listening capacities of the public administration as well as improve the feedback loop. Even though any communication strategy implies a strong cohesion within the administration and an effective collaboration with local stakeholders, the two approaches described carry within them different tools and organisation systems also according to the thematic implementation. 
Themes 
The cities involved in the project are also focusing on the communication of different themes, from tourism to business promotion and urban development. Communicating a city as an attractive tourist destination aims at strengthening its image both locally and internationally. Tourism involves a variety of stakeholders, such as hotels and restaurants, tourist operators, airports and ports authorities, culture institutions and many other. How to ensure that territorial marketing is substantiated by real quality services in the city? How to make the different stakeholders understand that the improvement of the city has a direct effect on their business? How to coordinate within the Administration when so many Departments are involved (Culture, Economic Development, Urbanism…)? All these challenges are shared by Genova, Varna, Alba Iulia and Liverpool. The communication of business promotion aims at strengthening the city’s conditions through the support of local companies, both the existing ones and the potentially new ones. Local businesses have the possibility of animating the local urban tissue and making the city attractive to new-comers and with a variety of instruments are already existing, such as Business Improvement Districts or the Vital’Quartier program, the real challenge is how to communicate it to the shop keepers and the wide audience? How to make business, especially small ones, understand the value of teaming up to develop a communication and a cooperation even with their competitors? How to make them understand that the improvement of the city is a direct benefit for them? These are the challenges that will be dealt by Semaest in Paris, EDB in Debrecen and Ghent. Urban development aims at making understandable to a wide audience often very complex technical matters, balancing the involvement of inhabitants in the decision making process and explaining why plans have been approved by the administration. How to communicate complex processes without flattering the content? How to ensure that all people are involved in the decision making process? As urban planning is a lengthy process, how to pursue the involvement on the long term? As citizens often have many valuable suggestions, how to ensure that input is addressed within the Administration in an effective manner? Such challenges will be dealt by Lisbon, Murcia, Palermo and Tartu. For this reason the cities will have the possibility of working in sub-groups on the communication of the specific theme they are tackling locally, allowing for the development of the network’s common methodology applied to the different themes.

"JESSICA 4 Cities. 
Introduction.
1. THE JESSICA General Implementation Model 
The JESSICA Initiative JESSICA (Joint European Support for Sustainable Investment in City Areas) is a Community initiative designed to assist the authorities in the Member States to exploit financial engineering mechanisms to support investment from 2007-2013 Operational Programmes in sustainable urban development projects Urban Development Fund An Urban Development Fund (UDF) is a fund investing in public-private partnerships and other projects included in an integrated plan for sustainable urban development. To be eligible for JESSICA funding, the UDF will need to demonstrate, amongst other things, sufficient competence and independence of management; a comprehensive business plan and budgets for undertaking qualifying projects; as well as sound financial backing. Whilst not specific on legal form, a UDF needs to be a separate legal entity, unless it is established as a “separate block of finance” within a financial institution. UDFs can be established at either a national, regional or local/city level to support public and private investors in integrated urban development plans. Holding Fund A Holding Fund is simply a fund set up to invest in more than one UDF. Its use is optional for Member States and Managing Authorities. The Role of Cities in the JESSICA Initiative Almost by definition, cities are meant to be the key beneficiaries of the JESSICA initiative, whose aim is to support “sustainable investment in cities”. The role of cities in JESSICA can be to: • develop a citywide strategy that conforms with sustainable urban development criteria; • identify/design projects and plans capable of mobilising and using JESSICA funds, possibly more effectively than under other financing arrangements; • negotiate with and direct appropriate parties (e.g. utility companies, private property developers, etc.) to use JESSICA resources; • support a planning environment where JESSICA supported projects can be implemented by other parties; • implement projects / investments supported by JESSICA. More specifically, as far as UDFs are concerned cities can for instance: • establish a UDF structure at a city level; • participate in a UDF, with other public and/or private parties, including other cities via cash injection or by way of contributions in kind; • benefit from the existence of a UDF, which could finance projects responding to JESSICA criteria, directly as project promoters or including these projects in an integrated urban plan. 
2. Combining sustainable outcomes and investor remuneration in urban transformation. 
JESSICA is an ambitious initiative, as it blends best practice urban planning with financial engineering instruments, and promotes sustainable urban development as a key instrument to support competitiveness, employment and convergence within the 27 EU Member States. JESSICA is a recent initiative, which was launched in 2006, with the initial exploratory studies only dating back to late 2006. The Urbact II Working Group JESSICA for Cities (“J4C”) could play a central role in supporting effective learning and exchange processes about JESSICA on a European level, while also addressing concrete needs for J4C partners and other stakeholders. JESSICA implies an innovative approach to transform the European urban fabric, in line with the Leipzig Charter and the new policy approach adopted for the 2007-2013 programming period. J4C partners have the opportunity to use Urbact II as a platform from which to show European regions and cities concrete ways to improve the integration between their urban transformation strategies and the use of financial resources made available under the 2007-2013 Operational Programmes. The figure below illustrates how the focus of JESSICA investment should be in the region in the red oval, i.e. on projects which present with a high economic performance (i.e. contribution to long-term sustainable urban development, measured on the horizontal axis) and a financial performance acceptable for a long-term or “patient” investor. Such financial performance may well be not immediately acceptable to a private investor but could be sufficient to provide the necessary return for a JESSICA investment fund. 
1.4 Where We Stand with Jessica 
1.4.1 Lessons learned so far 
Since the launch of the JESSICA initiative in mid-2006, preliminary studies have been carried out and an Expert Working Group has been set up by the competent ministries in the Member States to discuss how to best implement the initiative. Several further tailored preparatory evaluation studies have been and are being carried out under EIB supervision on behalf of the European Commission. This activity has so far highlighted some lessons: 
Lesson 1. JESSICA should be seen as a flexible instrument 
JESSICA needs to be interpreted differently in different constituencies, which means that Flexibility in approach is needed, bearing in mind also that JESSICA is meant to complement rather than compete with existing instruments. There is a relevant role for “best practice” urban planning, given the need to achieve “integrated” and sustainable urban outcomes. Mix of private sector financing and public funding including EC resources is an essential ingredient for JESSICA – the type of instruments and relative weight of the public vs. private component will probably vary across Member States. Management expertise is needed, covering awareness of best practice in planning and the design and operation of financial engineering indtruments. Operational streamlining of procedures – in particular Operational Programme mechanisms, including procurement, state aid issues and reporting - is needed. Therefore, two conclusions arise. First, the potential for easy replicability of Jessica models across countries is limited. However, knowledge-sharing is crucial so as to learn from different national experiences and use Jessica as a driver to promote integrated urban planning at a European level. 
Lesson 2. Pan-European exchange and co-operation is essential in order to identify investment strategies, linked to innovative financial models for sustainable urban transformation 
Not all kinds of developments are targeted by Jessica, but only those contributing to sustainable urban transformation objectives. In practice, whatever the scale of the projects, be it local, municipal, regional, or even wider, Jessica’s guiding criteria for investment are based upon the following principles: Projects would normally be, or be part of, mixed-use developments. They should encourage people to live in compact cities by promoting centralisation and discouraging suburbanization. They should contribute to create economically vibrant neighbourhoods and precincts. In big cities, JESSICA investment should exploit opportunities to use former industrial sites in central locations, unnecessary ports/logistics nodes in the built-up area, or large redevelopment areas under public ownership. In smaller towns, opportunities could rather focus on using infill sites and/or redevelopment areas. In any event apart from any specific requirements the investment must conform to two broad criteria that are essential for JESSICA. First, the projects must be part of an “integrated plan for sustainable urban development”. While such concept relates obviously to the Leipzig Charter and the sustainable community agenda, the precise interpretation of integrated plan and how it links to existing planning instruments is left to the MS/MA. Secondly projects must be capable – through user charges, revenue generation from market transactions or other payment mechanisms – to remunerate investors or to otherwise reconstitute the funds invested. The following list provides illustrative and non-exhaustive examples of the kind of projects which could be funded through a JESSICA financial engineering instrument: Site remediation and preparation. Basic urban infrastructure, street furniture, green spaces, Urban public transport or energy networks, Urban e-government infrastructure, Human capital infrastructure – health and education ; Science parks and business clusters/craft workshops ; Restoration of historic/listed buildings ; Cultural complexes and “signature/landmark” buildings ; Multi-use recreational complexes 
Lesson 3. Clarification of legal and regulatory matters is necessary, regarding in particular the legal form of Urban Development Funds 
The Regulations do not provide a detailed definition of financial engineering instruments for urban development, but these can be Urban Development Funds (UDF) or Holding Funds (HF). UDF’s are defined in the governing regulations as “funds investing in public-private partnerships and other projects included in an integrated plan for sustainable urban development”. Art 43 of Commission Regulation No 1828/2006 is not specific on legal form of UDFs, although a UDF should be an independent legal entity, or possibly a “separate block of finance within a financial institution”. ?? There is a need for a “business plan”, specifying items such as target market, operational budget, ownership structure, exit and winding up provisions. ?? Managing Authorities should take precautions to comply with regulatory framework, in particular with respect to procurement and state aid issues. A Holding Fund is a fund set up to invest in several Urban Development Funds - it is an option for MAs. Possible advantages of using a Holding Fund are the following: reduction of administrative burden for MAs, including the responsibility to supervise, monitor and report on the UDF’s; exploiting expertise and experience in fund and/or investment selection and management, in other words a HF can act as a vehicle to deliver advisory and technical assistance services to MS and MA’s; quicker delivery of EU Structural Funds (which become payable at the moment when the HF is established and funded through Operational Programme financial resources), which may be relevant where the MS/MA foresees absorption capacity issues; additional leverage opportunity, as the HF could in principle attract additional funds from public and/or private sources other than the OP. 
Lesson 4. Longer-term future for JESSICA: 
JESSICA should play a key role in the coming years in establishing a European platform for key players - DG Regio, IFIs, MS, private and public banks, not-for-profit organisations, investment funds and institutional, project promoters) in the funding of urban regeneration to deliver EU`s urban agenda. 
Chapter III. Developing a Jessica Toolbox for Cities. 
On the basis of the results of the review of local problems and processes, the key objectives and deliverables in the Second Phase of the WG are presented in this section. These proposals should be examined and discussed in preparation of the final meeting of Phase 1 on 29-30 July 2008. The aim of the Second Phase of the WG activity is to develop a “JESSICA Toolbox for Cities” to assist with the achievement of the main objective of the WG, namely to enable cities to use effectively opportunities offered by JESSICA to attain sustainable development outcomes and indicate to Managing Authorities and other relevant parties how to best structure JESSICA to benefit cities. This means that WG Partners must develop a thorough understanding of the procedures to develop through the urban investment cycle suitable strategies, integrated plans, projects and project portfolios and co-operate with MA’s to incorporate them into the relevant OPs and fund them through the JESSICA instrument. The next sections contain initial suggestions on toolbox components, to be further developed and amended as necessary during the Second Phase of the WG activity. 
3.1 Incorporating city projects into Operational Programme(s) 
How to: Link city investment priorities to urban agenda / sustainable development in relevant Structural Funds programming documents, in particular national and/or regional Operational Programme(s). Link to strategic / integrated urban planning at the different territorial levels, including o area-based approaches (e.g. districts, inner city, city-wide …) o thematic approaches (e.g. energy efficiency, sustainable transport, social infrastructure…). Link to urban dimension in relevant programming documents – in particular o as a horizontal theme, o urban priority axis, o multi-axis approach.
 3.2 Territorial Evaluation and Diagnostics 
How to: Assess (general methodology) key dimensions of territorial wealth such as o environment, physical capital, human capital, demography. Apply methodology to target territories / areas affected by projects. Use territorial evaluation and diagnostics to identify and assess strategies for return-generating investment to achieve growth, convergence, competitiveness 
3.3 Construction of JESSICA Instruments
 How to: Identify structures suitable for financial engineering instruments (HF/UDF) on the basis of: o Evaluating suitability / feasibility of key alternatives specifically: equity approach (i.e. investment fund model); non-equity approach (i.e. revolving fund model) o The ability of structures to perform key functions in JESSICA, such as: benefit from integration of investment components, leverage additional public and private funds, cross-subsidise high/low remuneration programme/project components, apply revolving fund principles (re-use of funds). Evaluate the opportunity to establish HF structures, e.g. considering o technical assistance and advisory needs o value of anticipating SF receipts to Partners and MA’s o associated costs and opportunities for Partners and MA’s. Identify and structure concrete UDF structures to meet Partners’ needs and OP objectives on the basis of previous analysis. Evaluate convenience of JESSICA vs. traditional instruments using cash-flows o by constructing and interpreting alternative cash-flow profiles as appropriate and necessary for: projects, funds, cities, MA’s. Contribute to the drafting of JESSICA contractual agreements between the key parties o primarily funding agreements between MA / HF / UDF) 
3.4 Construction of “Jessicable” Projects
 How to: Design and assess projects and project portfolios in line with integration criteria o by determining appropriate integration concept on the basis of sectoral mix, target area, thematic criteria, spatial level. Assess financial viability of projects and project portfolios. conventional financial profitability indicators ; affordability issues. Assess economic / sustainable development impacts of projects and project portfolios ; relying on cost-benefit and related approaches ; assessing impacts on territorial capital. Design / reconfigure projects, programmes and project portfolios to achieve required investor returns through concrete project illustrations and practical evaluation methods.

"JobTown. 
Urbact is about cities, so, more specifically, what can cities do to provide more and better jobs and opportunities for our young people? Where will new jobs come from? How well prepared are young people to get and keep these jobs? What are the challenges and opportunities? The JobTown Thematic Network will address these fundamental questions.  
Synthesis 
Local administrations are limited in what they can do about employment and opportunity; one can say the same about any administration. To the degree that local administrations can take action against youth unemployment and lack of opportunity, they are morally and democratically obliged to do so. In the present parlous state Europe finds itself in, it borders on inconceivable for a democratically elected administration to ignore the issue of youth unemployment. Self-evidently, elected local authorities must act – and be seen to be acting – against youth unemployment and the potential loss of a generation. The question then, is what can local administrations most usefully do for youth employment and opportunity? This is the question that the JobTown network addresses. Now, one of the fundamental ways a local administration can become more effective in tackling large issues of employment and opportunity, and compensate its own lack of resources and competences, is through partnership – with key stakeholders and with other levels of administration and policymaking. The fact that the URBACT programme – aside from being about learning and exchange for the local level of European administrations, and being based on the rationale that local administrations play a “key role… in facing increasingly complex societal changes”53 – not only encourages, but requires, participants to work through local partnership strategies, makes it ideally suited to support what JobTown is trying to do. In terms of contributing to URBACT’s own Capitalisation process. JobTown will develop practical ideas, advice and recommendations to support Europe’s cities in their quest for ‘More Jobs – Better Cities’. The network will provide responses to questions like ‘What can cities do to get more successful results from their actions?’ ‘In an age of austerity, how can they best help to grow their economies and achieve job-rich growth?’ Participating in the JobTown network will help the partner cities prepare for new regulations and financial instruments, particularly the 2014-20 period of EU Cohesion Funds; practice emerging from the network can be transferred to other cities to help them do the same. The objectives of JobTown fit neatly within the framework of the Europe 2020 Growth Agenda, and will make a contribution towards achieving its stated goals of more and better jobs, inclusion and better education levels. In terms of tackling structural issues Europe is currently wrestling with, coordinating local and regional growth and employment strategies, in the way JobTown proposes, can contribute to a larger process of overcoming Eurozone competitiveness imbalances. It is these self-same imbalances that have done so much to contribute to economic instability, job losses, failing growth and lost investment. While these are very much macro-level issues (2020, competitiveness imbalances, etc.), it is very much specific local knowledge and understanding that determine whether macro-level policy is implemented successfully. For instance, across Europe there is a broad push towards German style dual educational systems, which have served that country so well. However, there are no car manufacturing plants (or similar scale industrial activity) in a place like Cyprus; how then would such German best practice be usefully transferred there? Obviously ‘copy paste’ would be a failure. Rather, one would have to find a way to translate such practice into something that made sense for the local context. This requires local on the ground knowledge, which is precisely the level participants in a network like JobTown work at. The administrations participating represent a range of scales and geographies and socio-economic problems that, though varying in degree of severity, are thematically similar and the cause of complementary concerns. As such, the network does a reasonably good job of representing a European cross-section grappling with youth employment issues. If some of the administrations are smaller than others, they also enjoy concrete relevant competences and the direct political support and involvement of their mayor (or equivalent top elected official), a capacity to mobilise local stakeholders based on existing direct relationships, and the support of structural fund Managing Authorities and other public bodies and administrations – as well as some interesting and creative approaches to, and experiences of, working at the local level. Every partner has something to offer and has needs for learning and capacity building. Partnership gelled well in the final meeting of the Development Phase and synchronicities were evident among the different administrations. Building on the study visit process, the final meeting of all JobTown Partners in September in Gondomar, Portugal included a Peer Exchange Workshop designed to identify partners’ needs and priorities, and thus what the JobTown network should work on in the Implementation Phase, and how. The Workshop was conducted by the Kaiserslautern partner, and drew on the Project Cycle Procedure that they regularly work with. The results of the Workshop, and the research conducted prior, have fed directly into the definition of approach the JobTown network will follow in the Implementation Phase – broken down into nine principles – and the five subthemes that will orient the work and the Transnational Workshops taking place in the Implementation Phase. 
Approach. 
In terms of what sort of approach to follow, nine guiding principles have emerged throughout the Development Phase: 1) Integrated – Given the multiplicity and interaction of causal factors of youth unemployment and poor employment, there is a need for integrated approaches to youth unemployment. As such, the approach must be systemic, with interconnected actors involved in developing, learning and adapting their methodologies and approaches, in an ongoing joined up process. 2) Structural and Conjunctural – Youth unemployment, poor employment and lack of opportunity are structural problems, clearly pre-dating the economic crisis. The long-term nature of the fundamentals causing the problem requires structural and systemic efforts. The intensity of the current crisis conjuncture is inflicting long-term impacts, which are already adding to the accumulated burden of long-term structural problems. The current circumstances are so bad, they generate an intense pressure that simply cannot be ignored. Furthermore, democratic legitimacy requires administrations to address, and to be seen to be addressing, the immediate concerns and problems of society; hence actions must address both the long-term and the short-term – that is, combine structural and palliative functions. The palliative function is particularly important in terms of reducing ´scarring´/hysteresis (see State of the Art) which is taking place right now, and which by definition cannot be resolved at a later date – i.e. because the damage will have already been done. On a tactical level, short and medium-term achievements can be instrumental to maintaining support for efforts that will only give fruit in a longer-term. 3) Cost-effectiveness – In the current environment of resource and budgetary restrictions, actions and programmes must be cost-effective to be viable in practice. Partners cannot just throw money at the problem; this has failed in the past. Moreover, there is no, or little, money to throw. So, while something must be done, it had best be as inexpensive as possible. 4) Recognition of different profiles and governance challenges – To make peer exchange and learning effective, there should be recognition of, and adaptation to, the different profiles and governance challenges of different peers and their differing concerns and priorities. The network exists for the needs of its members, not vice versa. 5) Two-step targets of the impact – It is important to ensure that the learning acquired by participating individuals, in the transnational activities of the project, is transferred to the organisations they represent, so that change can happen and impact is achieved. The idea is that entire organisations should be benefiting from participating in the URBACT JOBTOWN network. 6) Political support and involvement, and Policy Community – Addressing structural youth unemployment, poor employment and general lack of opportunity, and working on local development strategies, is a long-term process that needs strong political commitment – i.e. support from elected officials and policy makers. Likewise, a key factor for ensuring the implementation, of whatever comes out of the Local Action Plans, is that their contents have a helpful relationship with the policy priorities of the ESF and ERDF 2014-2020 Operational Programmes. To facilitate this helpful relationship, the Managing Authorities need to work with the project partners, who effectively provide them with ready-made access to the kinds of local dynamics and stakeholders that their policies are ultimately concerned with – i.e. the MAs get a channel to the local level. Moreover, the Managing Authorities stand to benefit from exchange with their peers who are concerned with similar issues and challenges – i.e. MA peer learning. 7) Continuation, legacy and local outreach – Local Partnerships are meant to be the beginning of ongoing vehicles for stakeholder cooperation with other actors and different sectors (e.g. employers, educational institutions & public administrations and bodies), which will continue and evolve after the Urbact project cycle, for as long as they can continue to be useful. 8) EU level outreach – Because the issue of youth unemployment and poor employment is a significant problem across Europe, it is important that project results are widely disseminated at EU level. Brussels is the obvious place for concentrating efforts at outreach to European Commission policy makers and programmes, the Parliament and other institutions, as well the community of national, regional and local representations (the previous point 7 being about outreach in each partner’s home territory). 9) Quality and Impact – Effective evaluation, with a particular emphasis on providing actionable feedback, is key to ensuring project objectives are achieved and for continuously reviewing approaches, methods and tools. Moreover, evaluation should contain an element of meta-evaluation – that is, evaluation of the evaluation – such that it may be suitably adapted throughout the process, as new understanding emerges. 
Sub-themes 
The work of the network will be structured in terms of five sub-themes and the each Transnational Workshop will be dedicated to one of these sub-themes: 
Sub-theme 1: Developing effective models of cooperation – for involving and mobilising youth, local businesses, training and education providers, and relevant public bodies, services and administrations. 
Sub-theme 2: Making education and vocational education and training responsive to the needs of the local labour market. This means improving career and vocational guidance, apprenticeships, traineeships, entrepreneurial education and the acquisition of generic skills, for the lower skilled and also for helping university graduates make successful transitions into the world of work. One of the transversal problems that emerged in the Development Phase was that of unemployment co-existing with jobs that go unfilled or are hard to fill. This is a problem of planning (training, VET and university structures and curricula), but also in many cases of attractiveness. Many people – young people and the families and peers who condition their decisions – are just not attracted to the idea of pursuing certain professions and/or the training or educational paths leading to those jobs – typically those of a more technical or vocational nature. A commonly repeated view was that these professions and educational paths need to be ‘dignified’. This issue is clearly a challenge to making education and training more complementary to the needs of the world of work, and so will be addressed as part of the sub-theme. 
Sub-theme 3: Labour market analysis: matching employment and demand by improving detection and forecasting of labour market evolution and needs, in terms of demand for skills and professional profiles. 
Sub-theme 4: Support for business creation and development, self-employment, acquisition of entrepreneurial skills, and improving the business environment. 
Sub-theme 5: Social economy and resource management: Innovation and how to do more for less. 
Conclusion 
The work the JobTown network proposes to do is necessary and valuable. To some it may seem a small part of a very large problem, but it is a problem that must be worked on by all of us at every level. Cities are obliged – morally and politically – to play their part. Cities’ efforts to create youth employment and opportunity on a local level, and their local development strategies, are ultimately two sides of the same coin. URBACT’s vocation is that of supporting the sustainable development of cities. The scale the problem – youth unemployment, lack of opportunity, the economic, and now institutional, crisis, and structural problems pre-dating the crisis (precarious employment, underemployment, lengthening and unstable transitions to autonomous working life, NEETs, two-tier labour markets, ins and outs, etc.) – has now reached, is such that it has become, without exaggerating, a fundamental threat to our economies, our societies, the European project, our social model and our way of life. It is difficult to think of something we should be more concerned about.

"State of the art
This paper supports the ACTIVE A.G.E. working group, presenting the “state of the art” on demographic changes and active ageing strategies at the European level. It traces a broad picture of the European debate, focusing on experience at the national and local levels. The first section illustrates the EU demographic trends and policy guidelines; the following sections will analyse the main issues emerging from these trends, the key drivers and the main policy domains (economy, care services and insecurity) and will present examples of projects, initiatives and strategies aimed at coping with these challenges.
1. EUROPEAN AGEING SOCIETY: TRENDS AND EUROPEAN PERSPECTIVE
1.1 Demographic trends in the EU 27
In the coming decades, the size and age-structure of Europe's population will undergo dramatic changes due to low fertility rates, continuous increase in life expectancy and the retirement of the baby-boom generation. Ageing populations will pose major economic, budgetary and social challenges. They are expected to have as ignificant impact on growth and lead to significant pressures to increase public spending, making if difficult for Member States to maintain sound and sustainable public finances in the long term. Worldwide, the proportion of mature people and the more aged is growing faster than any group. In the European Union Member States the share of over 64-year-oldswill be 22% in 2025 (up from 17% in 2008) (see Table 1) and the share of over 55 will be 31%, with peaks of 39% in Italy and 37% in Slovenia and Finland1.Demographic changes (such as increased longevity), and the phenomenon of a counter ageing society (that is a population that lives longer and feels younger)2 present both challenges and opportunities to promote active ageing. While longer life expectancy entails the need to postpone retirement in order to guarantee the sustainability of the welfare system and citizens well-being, counter aging allows for the promotion of longer working lives, and the integration of various sources of income in old age. To achieve the goal of a longer working life, however, it is necessary to overcome the main barrier which is represented by age-related discrimination. The new welfare should also provide for very effective health systems in order to improve the working and living conditions of mature people. Finally, older people must be recognised as active citizens and must have their interests promoted as such – in the labour market, in health and care and incommunity activities and in the society.3
1.2 European perspective: from challenge to opportunity
The ageing population will affect society in a number of ways. Existing policies at both the EU and national levels need to be reviewed in order to assess their effectiveness and determine whether they need to be adjusted to take account of the changing EU demography. The European Union has opened the debate on how to tackle these issues, what role the EU should play and how demographic challenges need to be addressed. The first international debate on ageing society dates back to the 1980s, but the first initiatives only emerged in the 1990s. These included: the establishment of the European Commission’s Observatory on Ageing and Older People, the European Council of Essen4 and the Resolution on senior citizens in the 21st century – “a new lease of life”5. In 1999, the United Nations in collaboration with the European Commission promoted the ""International Year of Older Persons""6. In this communication the European Commission outlines a broad European policy agenda for active ageing. “The Commission points to the need for reforms of labour market practices (i.e.lifelong learning and training and ways of maximising labour market participation across all age cohorts),pension systems (i.e. flexible retirement options to curb early retirement) and health systems (i.e. effective and efficient health care provision for the elderly and the very old)” (Activage 2006).In the following years the debate waxed ever more intensive at European level, leading the European Commission to publish policy guidelines on the issue. In October 2006 Social Affairs Commissioner Vladimir Spidla presented his communication ""The demographic challenge - a chance for Europe"". The communication was a follow-up to the 2005 Green Paper on Demographic Change, which received input from a wide-range of stakeholders. The Commission's strategy rested on five policy pillars: 1. Promoting demographic renewal combined with better access to accommodation, affordable and quality childcare and a better balance between working life and private and family lives; 2. promoting employment: creating more jobs and longer working lives, stimulating ""active ageing"" and improving public health; 3. improving the productivity of Europeans at work; 4. receiving and integrating migrants; 5. making sure that public finances remain healthy and guarantee adequate social security and equity between generations. ""The source of the problem"", the communication says, ""is not higher life expectancy as such, rather it is the inability of current policies to adapt to the new demographic order and the reluctance of businesses and citizens to change their expectations and attitudes, particularly in the labour market"". The ""demographic challenge"" has to be ""mainstreamed"" (integrated) into all other European and national public policies. The new employment guidelines and the Barcelona and Stockholm targets took the promotion of active ageing forward in an integrated approach promoting support for youth employment, labour market participation for women and reconciliation between work and family life at the same time. (See integrative guidelines no. 18 “Promote anew life cycle approach to work”).The European Parliament (EP) has contributed to moving the discussion forward at the EU level. The EP Inter-group on Ageing, originally set up in 1984, provides Members of the European Parliament (MEPs)with a forum for discussion and action. Over 35 MEPs - representing most of the Member States and all the political parties – support this Intergroup on Ageing. Among the issues that have been raised in the last couple of years are: age discrimination in employment and in access to goods, facilities and services; health ; the right of residence for pensioners in the EU; pension provisions; and support for careers of dependent older people. Finally, a report presented by Bushill-Matthews, UK Conservative spokesperson on the EP employment and social affairs Committee and Vice-President of the Ageing Intergroup in the EP, called attention to the ways in which the ageing of Europe's population can be turned into an advantage. Education, training and positive attitudes to older people in the workplace can help, and not hinder, the European drive under the Lisbon Agenda to become more prosperous and globally competitive. The EP is of the opinion that Europe does not need more Directives but more exchange of best practice and more flexibility all round. The issue of the budgetary impact of an ageing population is, of course, of paramount importance. A report8published by the European Commission Directorate General for Economic and Financial Affairs, “The impact of ageing on public expenditure: projections for the EU25 Member States on pensions, health care, long-term care, education and unemployment transfers (2004-2050)” assesses the potential economic impact, and the timing and scale of budgetary changes that could result from ageing populations. The fiscal impact of ageing will accelerate as of 2010. Overall, on the basis of current policies, age-related public expenditures are projected to increase on average by 4 percentage points of GDP by 2050 in EU25 and up to 10 % in several Member States. A preventative approach to the health status of the elderly could help alleviate the burden. The same applies to long-term care: policy measures that can reduce disability and favour home care rather than institutional care can have a significant impact on public spending. Well aware of the challenge that demographic changes represent for the social protection systems, at the First Forum on Europe’s Demographic Future, held in Brussels on 30-31 October 2006, it was argued that Member States must support active ageing by acting through different integrated policies embracing manifold issues: lifelong learning; healthy working conditions and adaptation of workplaces and work organization to the needs of older workers; age discrimination in the labour market faced by older workers; and social services to support the autonomy of the elderly and facilitate their integration in society. Member States need to take into account the various issues raised by ageing society in their National Reports on Strategies for Social Protection and Social Inclusion. These reports monitor achievements in the field of social inclusion, pensions, health and long-term care. Only an integrated approach to such policies, however, can come up with an adequate strategy to prevent poverty and social exclusion for elderly people. Indeed, active inclusion becomes a means of promoting the social and labour market integration of the most disadvantaged and elderly. It is only with an integrated approach to such strategies that the right type of tool can be forged to prevent poverty and social exclusion for the elderly. To this end, Member States have established various networks and institutions (see Table 2).The Commission will monitor the results obtained in each Member State as regards the employment rates of women and men aged over 55 as well as the age of withdrawal from the labour force, and will report on specific examples of best practices from Member States. In support of these goals, the European Union has agreed to step up support to Member States with a reinforced European Social Fund and Lifelong Learning programme for 2007-2013. The Commission will consult the stakeholders on initiatives aimed at establishing a Community framework to improve cross-border supply of health services and mobility for patients. Member States are also invited to implement fully the Directive on equal treatment inemployment, and especially with regard to age discrimination. Finally, in February 2007, the Employment and Social Affairs Ministers adopted a Resolution on the contribution that older people make to society and asked the Commission to present a report in 2008 on ""the adjustment of economic and social structures to the needs of older people"". The Ministers also want the 7thFramework Programme and the Structural Funds to take better account of the growing and diversifying demand for goods and services on the part of older people, thus enabling Europe to become a leader in the ""silver economy"". In October 2008, the European Commission will address how best to take into account the needs of an ageing population, paying special attention to the conditions and the potential role of dependent people and their families in areas such as town and country planning. In 2009, the results of the initiatives announced in the communication on ageing and the lessons of the Forum on ageing will form the subject of a chapter in the Annual Progress Report, which the Commission will devote every two years to the EU's state of preparedness in increasing life expectancy. Despite the uptake of the active ageing discourse in so many reports and policy programmes at the various levels of governance, the active ageing paradigm is still far from finding comprehensive adoption in the various domains. Factors such as (among others) family life, employment, education, socio-cultural participation, material security and health are deeply interrelated with various policy domains of relevance to ageing. Recognition of this interaction suggests adopting a life-cycle approach, rather than concentrating simply on the fiscal, economic or employment aspects of ageing. Adopting a holistic view entails that successful ageing policy-making needs to address all generations: ageing policy is fundamentally about providing, extending and safeguarding political, economic and social rights for citizens of all ages. In short, citizenship for older people presupposes citizenship for everyone. This approach will help to reframe the problem of ageing as an ‘opportunity’ for empowerment of older persons with enhanced capabilities.
2. KEY DRIVERS AND TRENDS
On the basis of the above analysis, we can single out three policy areas which are at the core of the welfare system and at the basis of any sustainable active ageing policy, namely:• Age and the Economy;• Age and Care Services;• Age and Insecurity. These macro-themes have also been indicated in the Local Mappings as the most compelling in the specific local realities. Developing and implementing exchange and learning activities on sustainable urban policies with the focus on these topics is considered by the Active A.G.E. working group an important step towards the achievement of active ageing.
2.1 Age and the Economy Challenges
Employment is the principal means by which citizens of all ages can meet their needs and fulfil their socioeconomic aspirations. At the same time, a higher employment rate is the only way to secure long-term sustainability for any welfare system. That is why, in the framework of the ageing policy design, the EU has set itself two targets to be met by 2010: first, to raise the employment rate of older workers up to 50%(Stockholm target-2001) and, second, to delay by five years the age at which older workers stop working(Barcelona target-2002). The Stockholm objective is actually reached only by a limited number of countries (Table 3) whereas the latest projections from the AWG indicate that the European Union could on average reach the 50% target by 2013 and 60% by 205016. Figure 1 shows that all the Active A.G.E. country partners but the UK show employment rates of 55-64-year-olds lower than the EU average. In Southern countries (Italy and Greece) the short supply of jobs makes unemployment a problem for all ages: employment policies often face difficult trade-offs (young versus old), which translate into long-term unemployment and outright exit from the labour market for elderly people. In other countries the problem is, rather, to create incentives to retain older people within the labour force. Finally, even Member States like the UK, which reached the Stockholm target, have lower rates for women and unskilled people. In order to promote longer working lives, it is imperative to tackle the main barrier to active involvement in the labour market, namely age-related discrimination. Firm-level employment practices often prevent older workers from remaining in or rejoining the labour market. Pension systems tend to encourage early retirement and often prevent any form of activity after retirement. Health-care systems are not geared to cope with the problem of ill-health and work. Age-related discrimination is especially severe for unskilled workers and women. Rapid technological change has widened the competences gap for elderly workers17. Poor education and lack of human capital lead to exclusion from learning pathways in a vicious circle of discrimination in the workplace. Mature people who lose their jobs after decades of repetitive tasks are often unable to adapt their competences to the new demands. As for women, work-family reconciliation and gender segregation remain a pressing issue throughout Europe.18 Lack of adequate policies for work-life balance lead to spells of inactivity during working life19. Data disaggregated by gender and age show that mature women are the most penalized in the labour market. There are fewer learning opportunities for women in general, and for mature women in particular, making adaptation to labour demand and labour market re-entry extremely difficult. When this occurs, it is often at the cost of discrimination, segregation and poor job quality,20 especially in terms of wage and job security. To adopt an active-age, life-cycle perspective implies rediscovering and valuing the resources that aged workers can represent in the knowledge economy/society, and exploiting the contribution that they can make to economic growth, while coping with disadvantage and discrimination well before they actually become pressing. In this holistic approach, elderly people represent an important stock of accumulated human capital– that is, of knowledge and competences – usually in the form of tacit knowledge that can be transferred to younger workers mainly by informal learning. They can supply important services for the well-being of populations of all ages, especially for the children and young members of families. On the demand side, they represent an increasing share of consumer individuals and households: by affecting both the path and the pattern of consumption, they affect the rate of growth of GNP and its composition. Policy context Policy reforms have been targeted to the economic system (e.g. deregulation of the labour market, flexibility measures, pension reforms) and to individuals (e.g. activation policies such as training, life-long learning, employment centres). Trade-offs may arise between these various measures: for instance, legislation easing dismissal may impact on poverty; policies aiming at retaining elderly people in employment may conflict with the goal of increasing the employment rate of youth. Indeed, in the past, concern over youth unemployment has represented one of the main obstacles to the implementation of strategies aimed at lengthening working life, and resort was made to early retirement as a means to alleviate the problem of youth unemployment. The increase in the dependency ratio of elderly people has brought the sustainability of the welfare system, and in particular pensions and health costs, to the forefront21, prompting policies to favour longer working lives. As from the 1990s, pension reforms22 began to be implemented to raise the employment rates of elderly people and delay retirement. To avoid the trade-off, the employment of mature workers needs to be complementary to youth employment, not competitive. This can be achieved through various policies including, for instance, more part-time employment for elderly people or gradual retirement schemes. Promotion of high employment rates for mature workers thus requires integrated efforts on the part of all levels of governance and of the various policies over the life cycle. Strategies for flexicurity – i.e. flexibility in changing jobs and security in guaranteeing the employment - should encompass the whole life-cycle and be specifically targeted to the weakest segments of the labour market, and in particular the elderly in ourcase. Increase participation of people over 55.The success of policies aimed at promoting longer working lives depends as much on the attitude older people have towards work as on the employers’ willingness to retain and hire them. This objective requires an integrated strategy. Employment retention and re-entry: can be achieved through strategies aimed at overcoming discrimination, by acting both on the demand size (e.g. incentives to firms) and on the supply side, by providing incentives to elderly workers. Promoting longer working lives: This objective can be achieved by increasing flexibility in retirement23,deferring retirement (by improving quality of jobs - monetary and non-monetary working conditions),implementing gradual retirement, and/or combining retirement and work. As mentioned above, these measures affect the relationship between generations and are conditional upon the (existence of and adequate aggregate demand for labour, flexible working time arrangements and implementation of social policies securing well-being for mature people. National strategies for gradual retirement differ across countries and can be grouped in four models (see table 4). Local policies within the Active A.G.E. working group will need to be coordinated with their own national strategy. Lifelong learning. Measures aimed at promoting ‘lifelong learning’, through training and qualification, may help mature workers to adapt to the knowledge economy. Adult learning responds to different aims: personal, civil, social, and employment-related purposes, thus contributing to both productivity growth and social inclusion (see the European Commission’s Memorandum on Lifelong Learning). Mature, unskilled workers face discrimination in access to adult learning: people aged 55-64 years old are much less involved in formal and informal learning activities, including computer-based activities to overcome the digital divide (see fig. 2 for the Active A.G.E. partners countries and the EU average). In those countries where mature people are more involved in learning activities they also have higher employment rates (see the UK in Figure3). This evidence stresses the need to remove the barriers in adult learning activities and to improve the adult learning sector quantitatively and qualitatively. The Action Plan on Adult Learning27 promoted by the European Commission moves in this direction. The Commission invites Member States to encourage the process of credit transfer and the development of a National Qualification Framework; to improve adult learning quality; to offer the possibility to achieve at least one higher level of qualification; to implement a process of assessing and recognising of non-formal and informal learning; and to improve monitoring activities. Overcoming the digital divide, favouring intergenerational co-operation; Gradual retirement could favour a process of transferring competences from old to young workers, for instance through tutorship and coaching of new recruits. This positive externality would reduce training costs, favour pensions sustainability and reduce the waste of knowledge. Promoting entrepreneurship. Table 4 summarises the path of reforms in this direction taken by the Active A.G.E. country partners, the policy context in which they were brought in and the employment and income situation of mature people in order to present an overview of the context in which Active A.G.E. will be implemented. What can active A.G.E. working group learn from other European projects? Various projects have been carried out at the European or national level to investigate the needs and challenges of an ageing society. Some of these studies focus on strategies to promote the employment of elderly people by improving their competences and skills, for instance: “Active ageing for competencies transfer and training” (Acting29), “Ageing workers to recuperate employability” (Aware30), “Agemanagement”31, “Equal Skill synergy”32, “Chance project for over 40”33, “L'emploi des salariés de plus de 55 ans en Europe du Nord”. “A European guide for second careers” (an Equal Partage project, involving French and Italian partnership)produced a guide to improve the age management practices in firms, in order to increase job opportunities for members of the workforce with more years of experience35.Strategies to encourage intergenerational solidarity and the exchange of competences between young and elderly people have exploited a variety of tools: enabling interactions among groups to share experience and recognize tacit knowledge, learning platforms37, coaching38, tutoring and mentoring models, new communication channels and partnerships40. Usually, young people teach the use of ICT and elderly people teach handicraft activities, tacit knowledge or organizational competences. In the Bavarian area this kind of transfer is very common: many pensioners, often under their own initiative, provide orientation and transfer their own working experience to young people approaching the labour market. Projects have been launched to search for new solutions for redundant workers in declining areas where firms are obliged to close, delocalise or to reduce production (the Walloon government, in collaboration with trade unions and the office for vocational training and employment, introduced a restructuring Support Plan to help workers losing their jobs) or the problem of employment in rural areas (“Clare Life Long Learning Network” addressed the need to provide a LLL curriculum in a rural area of the West coast of Ireland42).Other projects, co-financed by the EU and investigating one or more of the above-mentioned areas of interest(employment, services and intergenerational solidarity) are presented in Table 6, which also includes references to the projects. Two more research projects are illustrated in more detail in Table 7 and 8. The first project identifies good practices to increase job opportunities and retain older workers in employment. The second project focuses on Italy and considers the possibility to obtain the involvement of firms in the active promotion of employment of the elderly.
2.2 Age and Care Services Challenges
Health and long term-care play a crucial role in promoting active ageing. First, good health is the critical precondition for activity in old age. Second, with life expectancy steadily progressing, long-term care is claiming an increasing share of resources, in terms of both time and financial expenditure. Developing innovative ways of providing health and care services proves crucial to ensure equal and universal access to adequate health and long-term care (see the suggestions provided by the Expert Group on Social Determinants of Health Inequalities).There are still large differences in health status both across countries and within countries, among different groups of persons. The socio-economic literature finds a close relationship between health status and living conditions (besides lifestyles: smoking, alcohol). A recent comparative analysis43 investigated which variables may be related to differences in the health status as measured by the mortality rate: education (the Czech Republic and Slovenia), type of job (Spain), housing tenure (Italy and England). Also the self-perception of own health status shows considerable cross country differences. Within the Active A.G.E. partnership all the countries exhibit a worsening of perceived health status with age, with Poland, Slovenia and Bulgaria showing the highest share of negative perceptions (see Figure 5).Rapid population ageing has dramatically increased the social and economic cost of elderly care44. Health problems and some degenerative pathologies, such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease or senile  dementia are on the increase, putting even more pressure on the provision of long-term care.45 Each country/society defines the minimum rights to care, and the minimum obligations of family/society, doing soeither explicitly through regulation, or implicitly by defining the scope of policy provision. In SouthernEurope, families are still legally bound to take care of elderly people; in continental Europe, family responsibilities are regulated implicitly; in the UK and Scandinavian countries there is no family obligation specified by law and there is a more explicit individual entitlement to a minimum level of service. The Central and Eastern European countries have moved back to a care regime which relies heavily on the family. However, as care regimes strive to adapt to demographic and social changes, common trends a reemerging. Solutions to the financial constraint have been sought in two directions: reduction of entitlements -targeting services more closely on the population in greatest need - and reduction of care costs. As a consequence of the search for cost effectiveness/reduction we observe a convergence in the ways the care market is organized : all countries are moving towards home care, private provision, and cash transfers. Demand for care labour, however, is increasing rapidly, and all countries are experiencing problems in recruiting enough workers to meet the demand. In some countries, the shortage of care workers has been met by a large inflow of immigrant, mostly female, workers. It has been argued46 that the way in which care is provided and financed may entail considerable differences in the creation of a formal care market. Provision in kind and ‘tied’ monetary transfers - that is, cash benefits regulated in various ways – are most effective in creating a formal market. Conversely, unconditional cash allowances have slowed down the creation of aformal care market, encouraging, rather, supply from the informal market via either family carers or carershired by the family in the market. Active A.G.E. partnership stresses the importance of long-term care services for active ageing in a life-cycle perspective. In the case of frail elderly people, the challenge is to guarantee a better health status, overcome insecurity, avoid isolation and exclusion, and ensure a better quality of life in old age. To the carer, usually an (elderly) female family member, the organisations and provision of long-term care services may represent an effective means for work-life reconciliation, thus supporting labour market participation. Policy context Long term care has been on the agenda of the European Commission for quite some time and improving access, quality and sustainability of long-term care represents three main objectives of the EU Member States. Progress in the achievement of these objectives is monitored by devoting a special chapter of the Member States’ Report on Social Protection and Social Inclusion to long-term care (see Table 6 for a description of elderly care issues in the Active A.G.E. country partners). Barriers to access persist for three main reasons: lack of care services; geographical disparities; and financial constraints, on both families and public institutions. In many Member States, long-term care systems need to be reformed, favouring stronger synergies between health care and social services. Moreover, the provision of home care, residential care and nursing services need to be more closely integrated. The use of new technologies and formal skilled carers need to be encouraged in order to help people to stay in their own homes as long as possible. The main issues of relevance in the provision of long-term care can be summarised as follows: Healthy ageing: by promoting healthy lifestyles to reduce future health costs and implementing policies to prevent ageing health problems ex-ante. For instance, many city councils run yearly prevention campaigns for elderly people (e.g. prevention of ictus, osteoporosis and heart disease). The psychological aspects of ageing should not be undervalued: attention should be paid to the need to protect elderly people from anxiety and depression. Long-term care: availability and financing. In most countries, long-term care is usually provided at the local level by the Municipalities. Three major issues merit particular consideration: Home care: Home care has been promoted by public policies in many European countries48 in order to avoid hospitalisation, reduce resort to the more expensive residential care, and respond to the preferences of elderly people and their families. Care support for families. The shift to home care makes the need to assist frail elderly people and their families even more pressing: for instance, respite care centres for family carers, or assistance centres where qualified people help families of elderly persons affected by Alzheimer’s. Direct provision, cash allowances and vouchers. Contracting out of care provision to private (profit- and not for-profit) organisations is on the rise. Private providers must respect the conditions established at the local level by a system of accreditation. These organizations may provide the services directly on request coming from the family, while payment can be made either through direct subvention coming from the municipality (or with payment of a ticket) or through vouchers. In some countries (England) home care provision has a long history and only recently a system of monetary transfer has been introduced to give families the right to choose their assistance. Since the beginning of the1990s a large share of the services is supplied by independent providers, with the public authority retaining the role of ensuring quality standards and home care efficiency with a new assessment system. In other countries, such as Poland, Spain and Italy, the family retains full responsibility for care, while hiring female immigrant carers on the cheap. This is favoured by a system of Social Protection relying on unconditional monetary transfers. New technologies. Informal home care does not provide incentives to adopt new technologies to improve the quality and the efficiency of home care nor to improve the skills and qualifications of social carers. Some municipalities have used the European Social Funds to train informal carers in order to provide them with essential skills. What can active A.G.E. working group learn from other European projects? Many projects have now been launched addressing several aspects of long-term care. “Future elderly living conditions in Europe” (FELICIE) is a project financed by the EC under the 5th Framework programme LIFEQUALITY, to forecast the care needs (nursing homes and formal and informal care) of people aged 75 plus in 2030 under different scenarios. “Age Management - Valuing skills in the care sector” analysed the skill shortage of home care assistant, while EUROFAMCARE focuses on family carers in various EUcountries. Through the Public Health Programme, the European Commission funds projects related to health issues. In2003, the European Commission funded a project on “Healthy Ageing” which was coordinated by the Swedish National Institute for Public Health and brought together partners from 15 national public health and health promotion organisations. The project built upon the existing work of “Proven Strategies toimprove Older People’s Health - Eurolinkage report for the European Commission” (1999).Other research projects focused on different themes: good practices to improve service quality (e.g. Qualityin and equality of access to healthcare services, commissioned by DG Employment to identify and analyse barriers to accessing healthcare and to review policy initiatives taken by Member States to realise the objective of equitable access for all52); long-term care expenditure sustainability (“The research programme on Health and Ageing” carried out by the Geneva Association53).With regard to elderly care and housing, the Munich Länder established in many municipalities a group of experts working on ageing and social planning (Arbeitsgruppe für Sozialplaning und Altersforschung 54, AfA – München). This institute develops models of home care focusing on adapting houses to meet the needs of the elderly, or organizing community accommodation or groups of houses or buildings (in substitution for residential accommodation) that elderly people can share and where they can be assisted by professionals if necessary, but having all the characteristics of a house, where people feel at home.
2.3 Age and Insecurity Challenges
Elderly people face various risks of exclusion. Fast and continuous technical and socio-economic changes isolate old people from the community, creating a digital and a social divide. They may feel lonely or depressed, especially after retirement, or after separation from family members or from a familiar environment. They face problems of mobility: public transport in many European cities is ill-equipped to overcome their mobility reduction, while private transport proves too expensive for the income of a mature family. Housing represents one of the highest costs in the consumption of older people, driving them to the city outskirts, in houses that are ill-suited to their increasing dependency. They are often targets of abuse (seethe Commission Communication of March 2008, which recommended strategies for preventing and tackling elderly abuse, to be taken by Member States within the OMC on social protection and social inclusion).Finally, when retired, older people face the risk of poverty: their expenditure on housing, health and food absorbs most of an average pension. Figure 6 shows that in Active A.G.E. partnership countries people over 65 have lower incomes than the younger population, are in general at a high risk of poverty and live in private households with serious consequences on security. Policy context In March 2006 the European Council adopted three main criteria to enhance social inclusion in the Member States: to ensure access for all to services and benefits by fighting exclusion and discrimination; to promote active inclusion through labour market integration and the fighting of poverty; and to achieve greater coordination of social inclusion policies at all levels of government. Social inclusion is a transversal outcome that can be reached with labour market participation strategies, such as lifelong learning and employment, health and long-term care, and active citizenship. Social services and income transfers are needed to address poverty, mobility reduction and social exclusion. Social inclusion measures need to be coordinated: they involve financial issues (access to funding for older people experiencing poverty, i.e. microfinance); social services (e-inclusion, housing community involvement, home-based care, voluntary community services and intergenerational solidarity); and improved participation in the labour market and in the community. An active ageing agenda must be about rights and citizenship. Combating discrimination in the labour market, ensuring good health and long-term care in old age and providing adequate income are all ways of empowering older people. Active ageing policy must also ensure participation in social life and a real say indecision-making. Access to services (social services, transport and mobility, ICT). Access to quality social services opens the way to participation in society and to preventing exclusion: development of social care standards, assessment and control of social services, development of professional standards and a helpline offering advice to carers represent various ways of achieving it. This general objective may also mean different things to different countries, according to their socio-economic conditions, institutional settings, priorities: improving access to essential services (Italy, Slovakia and the UK); achieving a better balance between income transfers and services, and improving availability, quality, client orientation and versatility of services (the Czech Republic, Poland, Slovakia and the UK); increasing the provision of social services to dependent people to relieve the burden on families (Slovakia, Italy and Greece); developing preventive and rehabilitation services for the most vulnerable groups, taking into account ageing and changing family structures (in countries such as the Nordic ones, with the most innovative and comprehensive service provision). There is the need to involve users, to strengthen personalised measures and promote the role of NGOs through voluntary work, and to encourage self-help. Isolation may be reduced by providing good quality transport (with innovative solutions such as collective taxis at cheaper prices), shops, amenities and social centres near home. It may also be overcome through an integrated policy, encompassing mobility, the use of technology, provision of care services and informal services provided by friends and family (see the ENABLE-AGE project). While the use of ICT appears too complex for many elderly people, more user-friendly support and assistance from younger people may help to acquire self-confidence in the use of new instruments. Poverty reduction (housing, prices…). The economic conditions of elderly people, and especially of women, have worsened over the last decade. In many cases elderly people cannot afford an adequate standard of living: their income goes entirely into the consumption of essential goods and services - housing, health and food – and they are consequently obliged to forego cultural and leisure activities. Reducing poverty through the provision of primary needs, control of prices of primary goods and supply of cultural services can improve the well-being of these people. Housing presents two different problems: people without a house to live in (homeless) and dependent people living in houses that are too big or inadequate to their health conditions. Poverty compromises housing choices and the possibility for people to adapt their homes to their needs (European Social Housing Observatory). Access to adequate housing is a priority in all countries. Policy measures range from integrated strategies for access to affordable housing, helping the most vulnerable with low incomes and tackling the quality of housing and homelessness (the Czech Republic, Poland and the UK) to policies focusing on conditions of extreme vulnerability, improving housing and re-housing for people living in slums and preventing eviction, especially in the case of older people (Italy, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain) or cooperation among stakeholders to forestall the multiple factors leading to the risk of eviction (some Austrian Länder). A few countries address the problem of adequate and reasonably priced independent homes for people with disability and health problems, and resort to technology and social care to help old, dependent people with tasks such as cooking, cleaning and personal care. Territorial disparities and rural poverty increase the risk of social exclusion (Poland). Over-indebtedness can be a serious threat and can be prevented by improving access to bank accounts and affordable credit, and by offering guidance services to face the banking jungle (UK).Active inclusion. Active inclusion concerns involvement in community life. Illness, disability or frailty reduce social relationships and participation. For elderly people still able to work active participation may be achieved through the job, thereby also improving household incomes (see section 2.1 above). Volunteer work, such as school, park or cultural centre guardian duties or organising special events can also maintain the feeling of belonging to the community. Temporary events, such as dinner with friends, society games, clubs for the elderly or social centres, may act as active inclusion platforms. A safe environment plays a crucial role for the active participation of lone, frail individuals. In many cities, the lack of integration of immigrants leads vulnerable groups, such as older people, to feel alone and insecure. In these areas there is the need to work on general integration of all residents, with special focus on vulnerable groups that fear crime (for instance, policies aiming at promoting integration between young families of migrants and older native-born, or encouraging cohabitation of a single youth in the elderly person’s house).What can active A.G.E. working group learn from other European projects? There are now many programmes and projects dealing with the issues of social inclusion and security in old age, and quite a number of good practices at the European and local level. ESPON was set up to build a European scientific community and support policy development in the field of territorial development. The 2002 project (conducted within the framework of the ESPON 2000-2006programme and partly financed through the INTERREG programme) analysed the variety of demographic situations in the EU29 – the EU25 plus the two accession countries Bulgaria and Romania as well as Norway and Switzerland – seeking to relate the different demographic trends (areas of depopulation and areas of population growth) with economic, political and geographical factors. At the local level, many municipalities are addressing the issue of intergenerational solidarity in a variety of ways. The municipality of Milan has promoted a pilot project to welcome university students as flatmates for elderly people56. Similar initiatives are being realised in other Italian cities (Florence, Modena, Reggio Emilia, Viterbo, Bologna and Padua). Other initiatives promoted by non-profit associations (and with a long history in the United States) aim to ‘create a family’ for elderly people living alone (adopting agrandparent57), and to provide support in difficult periods or for specific needs. In a village in Estonia, a project has been launched to create the preconditions for a network of community services in order to help people living far from city centres to have access to local and flexible services. The project, implemented from October 2005 to May 2006, has seen production of a guide and establishment of a network between the service providers and the stakeholder. Housing conditions are an important factor for well-being. The municipalities intervene with provision of adaptable “homes for life”, to prevent older people from having to move (UK), or air conditioning when necessary, providing in-house services, such as cleaning, home-delivery to dependent elderly, and intervene in housing conditions to prevent accidents and promote diffusion of domotic technologies. They help with information on different housing solutions for elderly people who decide to move and organize specific transport services for elderly people. (The UNIACCESS project, funded under the 6th Framework Programme for Research aimed to promote and support accessibility in public transport. It brought together a group of stakeholders (end users, designers and manufacturers, operators, authorities) aiming at quality and equality of access to public transport in the E.U.).Finally, various other programmes address exclusion and empowerment. In many Italian cities organizations in cooperation with provincial and city councils help older people with their financial problems by favouring access to microfinance or calling for intervention of the Fund established by law 108/96 to prevent usury. Many municipalities with the support of NGOs set special prices for primary needs and cultural events and improve security, with information campaigns to warn against swindlers. Migrants represent a vulnerable group of elderly people. The European research project, “Age Gender Ethnicity” analysed the socio-economic situation of older migrant women (AGE+)59.
3. Conclusions
o Policymakers across the EU need to catch up with the realities of rapid changes in demography and family and social patterns. They also need to understand the changing nature and diversity of the population, including the elderly, who are all too often described as one homogenous group. Greater awareness is needed of the variability of sub-national demographic changes and the need for strategies at the regional and local level. Currently, the impact of demographic change is not being “integrated” into broader sustainable urban regeneration programmes/strategies. Most EU policies are affected one way or another by the demographic change the European Union is facing. Policy developments in such diverse areas as employment, pensions, social inclusion, health, transport, urban development, housing, research, education and citizenship, etc. need to be better coordinated to develop an accurate understanding of what demographic change means in order to support the right policy response. So far, the debate has focused excessively on the quantitative changes in an ageing society: pensions and health care expenditure, older worker employment rates, old-age dependency ratios etc. These are important points, but the necessary qualitative changes to the economic, social and political structures of society deserve equal attention. The main challenge faced by European labour markets is the stagnating demand. Local labour market policy aimed at reducing age-related discrimination in the labour market need to take into account the economic background. Labour market reforms targeting individuals (active labour market) need to be complemented by labour market reforms aiming at increasing demand. Pension systems should not erect barriers to labour market participation for older people. This implies abandoning mandatory retirement ages and reducing the punitive nature of taxation on earned income during retirement, as well promoting pension arrangements that permit part-time employment. With the ageing of the population and new trends in family structures, the need for long-term care will increase and there is an obvious added value for Member States to discuss the development of adequate and cost-effective long-term care. In some member states, the increase in the number of women working and the harsh working conditions in the care sector has led to an increased demand for (mostly female) migrant workers to provide formal and informal child and eldercare. o European poverty statistics show that whereas some older people enjoy high levels of income from private sources, 16% of older men and 21% of older women are at a risk of poverty and in some Member States the at-risk-of-poverty rate among older women is as high as 51%.o Poverty and social exclusion among older people is set to increase in the future as many people, especially women, will not enjoy full pension rights due to long spells of unemployment, family/carer’s breaks, forced inactivity (for example due to partner’s mobility), diminishing pension income (as a result of systems moving from defined benefits to defined contributions), etc. On the basis of the above analysis, the Active A.G.E. working group has singled out three policy areas which are at the core of the welfare system and at the basis of any sustainable active ageing policy, namely:• Age and the Economy;• Age and Care Services;• Age and Insecurity. These macro-themes have been indicated in the Local Mappings as the most compelling in the specific local realities. Developing and implementing exchange and learning activities on sustainable urban policies with the focus on these topics is considered by the Active A.G.E. working group an important step towards the achievement of active ageing.

JOINING FORCES.
Metropolitan governance & competitiveness of European cities.

INTRODUCTION/

Cities have played a leading role in national economic, social and cultural development for hundreds of years. Nevertheless, the trend towards the urban sprawl that has accelerated very much after World War2, and especially during the last 30 years, all over Europe, has led to a greater and greater dispersion of the cities’ assets over large urban areas, far beyond the existing administrative boundaries. In the circumstances of globalization, growing multinational companies, international trade, banking, etc, but also individual entrepreneurs and other creative people, tend to focus on the largest urban areas. In this context cities mean city-regions in fact, because either opportunities, challenges or conflicts derive from symbiosis of its wider area. Growing of development or, on the other hand, crises of traditional productive profile, both depend very much on position reached by actors in the worldwide competition. City-regions are the physical site of most of the economic and social successes and failures in the contemporary life of communities. 
Joining Forces as a European working group, developed within the framework of URBACT II, intends to focus its efforts on highlighting existing good practices in city-regions fostering competitiveness and economic modernization in a sustainable environment and a cohesive society. Furthermore, additional sources are scrutinized mainly from the side of governance at every level and organized forms of communities. This motivation fits within the general effort made by the European Union to enhance competitiveness and cohesion in the European Space.


Synthesis.
Cities have played a leading role in national economic, social and cultural development for hundreds of years. Nevertheless, the trend towards the urban sprawl that accelerated very much after World War 2, especially during the last 30 years in the wider Europe, has led to a greater and greater dispersion of cities’ assets over large suburban areas, far beyond their existing administrative boundaries... In the circumstances of globalization growing multinational companies, international trade, banking (etc.) but also individual entrepreneurs and other creative people, focus on the largest urban areas.
In this context city means city-region in fact, because either opportunities, challenges or conflicts derive from symbiosis of its wider area. Growing of development or on the other hand, crises of traditional productive profile, both depend very much on position reached by actors in the worldwide competition. City-region is a physical site of most of the economic and social successes and failures in the contemporary life of communities. In addition, contradictions arisen from the eventually enormous and fast development may also be crucial. 
Defining the city-region.
Sample cities as partners in Joining Forces are big cities playing an important role in their respective national economy and a leading role in their region. They are all big cities even if they vary quite extensively in size.
Comparing the size of cities and city-regions is a classic issue for European researchers: different methods for quantification exist, using different criteria of calculation (or at least different thresholds). Whatever the exact figures are, the most common calculations are based on either (or both) morphological areas data and functional area data:
Morphological urban areas constitute in fact the “physical” city and calculation are based on the continuity of the urban fabric or at least the density of urban settlements.
Functional urban areas represent the “economic” city and calculation are based on commuting (travel to work) flows.
The existence of different contiguous functional urban areas can also influence the way calculations are made; population data as shown in Table 3.1.(coming form the ESPON 1.4.3. project) underline the type of differences that can arise from the use of different methods of calculation.
As “Joining forces” is a working-group of practitioners and not researchers, the definition of the city-regions, which will be used in the working-group, will more be based on practical/political arrangements than on this definition of MUAs and FUAs. Nevertheless, this neutral, academic vision will be useful for the common understanding of communalities/differences between partner cities.

Partners in the project are also quite different according to their involvement either in regions of competitiveness (Lille, Florence, Brussels, Eindhoven) or convergence (Sevilla, Krakow, Brno, Bourgas). Nevertheless common issues can be characterized as conflicts, challenges, social answers on challenges, frameworks of policy formulation, policy instruments focusing on joining social sources.
Conflicts
Either radical development or unexpected crises in regional economy typically lead to inefficiency in size concerning administrative borders. Infrastructure and other collective cultural needs step over city, county, regional or national frontiers. A typical problem of civilization culminating in big cities and their surrounding area is environmental sustainability.
Furthermore, the low level of social cohesion is traditionally a very internal conflict in urban centres. If large local economies cannot avoid crises, cities become directly depressed areas which have to be re-vitalized. New places of work should be created in order to stop the deepening of decline in the social sphere. Local economic development concentrating on restructuring focuses city-regions as such. However, cities are places of competitiveness, as well, handed over opportunities to their wider outskirts. All-in all to-day urban problems are probably not to be solved with traditional policy instruments, such as forced development, direct institutionalization (esp. metropolitan government). 
Challenges
How can governance on a city-region scale focus the problems of local economic development, management of the environment and social cohesion? Depending on particular circumstances, challenges might be urban reconstruction or promotion of vitalization, like research and education, strategic planning, land use planning, etc. Tasks are naturally different in a depressed area, than in cities with an emerging economy. Another challenge is the management of the environment, i.e. preserving natural resources, especially water sources. Externalities must be subject of public functions in a market economy, for instance in the field of waste management and disposal. Social cohesion may be strengthened by public administration especially local governments with administrative solutions, like establishment of common territorial units for urban centre and its area. On the other hand without administrative measures functional development may focus also on this issue. For instance investment in public transport is a promotion of mobility not only in physical sense, but also in its social meaning. 
Social answers on challenges
Competitiveness is a social answer to economic challenges. It does not only mean providing a higher level of public services, but it also requires an actual ability to co-operate among different actors located in the same area. Sustainability as a purpose of managing environment supposes the idea of many collective decisions and development strategies for the more lively future. Social inclusion is a strategy for diminishing urban tensions among groups of inhabitants. Ethnic, gender, generation problems have to be solved in most of the big cities and their outskirts. Answers may be stated with help from the physical and social planning.
All of these answers can be formulated by decision-makers establishing a city-region in any format, because in fact city-regions are spatial frameworks of city-related social issues. These issues have already been elaborated by the Urbact 1 Metrogov Project. It is also known from this source, that a clear definition of existing models is possible and fruitful. Now, we can add how institutional forms may contribute to policy-making of competitiveness, sustainability and social cohesion in the city-region unified area.
Frameworks for policy formulation
Different types of policy formulation are highlighted in the field discussed above such as
- forms of local governments,
- forms of governance,
- inter-structural forms of governments.
As far as forms of local governments are concerned, cross-territorial administrative solutions are preferred, like different types of associations. In the field of governance cross-sector forms are focused, which means that interactive linkages of state, private and non-governmental forms and instruments are focused in general. Finally, inter-structural means city-region covering cross-border administrative structures involved by different national governments. These three dimensions may work simultaneously. The more developed a city-region is, the more complex relations are among these structures and in each of the elements of frameworks mentioned. What formal and informal instruments are social problems of city-regions managed with? 
The project summarizes and disseminates different solutions of city-regional co-operation in policy-formulation for key metropolitan answers such as competitiveness, sustainability and social inclusion on most serious challenges of the contemporary society in spatial relations. According to our initial practice-based hypothesis co-operation and co-addition of governing and social forces make possible to reach optimal outcomes in implementation of this complex development strategy. Practice makes difference between cities and city regions represented in the projects, therefore it is time to generalize common features, exchange experiences, learn lessons from each other in order to clarify the role of city-based arena of policy making in the wider European context.
2.1. Grouping and models
At least 4 different groups can be distinguished among our sample cities from an analytical point of view. Lille in itself represents a combination of models on different forms of city-region. Territorial bordering or contents of institutions and policies vary from statutory associations to developed forms of voluntary co-operation. The second group consists of cities in systems of regional/federative states, like Florence, Sevilla and Brussels. Position of metropolis is defined with their status in the region or member state in federation, where different functions of central state are delegated to. The following type is, in which our cities are adjusted simply in framework of a regional self-government. This is the case regarding Bourgas, Brno, Krakow, although Lille is also incorporated in a regional self-government of France. Finally, Eindhoven represents city-involvement in a delegated region of public administration. 
These groups consist of different models on government and governance of city-wide scale functions. Sometimes a city represents more than one model, or particular models followed by others, however the intensity is not necessarily the same. The Lille region is the most complex one that consists of five types of simultaneous models.
In summary, the partners in the project represent diverse models of city-regions, concerning their formal (institutional) characteristics, as follows. 
Lille 1 - (statutory) group of municipalities
Lille 2 - voluntary association of local and regional governments 
Lille 3 - informal cooperation
Lille 0 - involvement in the regional government 
Lille 00 - reaction to national government policy of metropolitan cooperation
Florence - implementation of national government policy on metropolitan government
Sevilla - metropolitan coordination (functional)
Brussels - federative entity (Brussels-Capital Region)
Krakow - metropolitan policy of regional government
Brno - efforts to adjust city-area management to regional policy
Bourgas - efforts to generate informal cooperation
Eindhoven - delegated region involving city-based forms of cooperation
In the list above, only an institutional structure is covered in every country represented in Joining forces, if formal status on cooperation exists at all. Even if it does, its content may be very different, spreading from spatial planning, coordination, leaders’ informal meeting etc. to joint organizations, financing of projects, managing city-region scale provision of public services. It means, structural issues are not more than elements of a framework for policy-making on cooperation in areas of big cities. The aim of the project is to find out, compare among different models and facilitate practice of joining social resources in metropolitan frameworks. Comparative actions are based on analyses of spatial functions, such as transport, solid waste management, water supply and protecting environment, and the framework of policy making is interesting only as a working context of the mentioned issues. 
Even if we are expecting a very fruitful process of exchanging experiences among all partners, there might be more specific linkages between two or more of them. According to the initial hypothesis apart from the general knowledge-based cooperation, more direct linkages may emerge between some partner cities. That is interesting for all, furthermore, more deeply involved actors will be an opportunity to scrutinize or learn more from one or another specific experience in order to realize a policy proposal, if the time is up in site for it, or alternatively to avoid mistakes made by others in a similar situation. It can be imagined and agreed by partners that in two or more Local Support Groups be formulated specific cooperation adding plus to the general content of the working group. 
Just an initial assumption is showed in the following table, based on institutional similarities and differences. Framework of relationships between the listed models and conditioned policy-orientation of city-region level might be introduced. It is supposed that the sketched framework may be filled in during the development phase of the project. We hope that we are able to highlight bi-lateral or multi-lateral lessons for any of participant city-regions. In the final report we will present the full table indicating cross-linkages among partners. One of our aim is to find out as many connections or simply possibilities for success stories as possible, presenting options (and, on the other hand, fallacies) of any model-orientation.
It is seen from the table that experiences of Lille are the most complex at different levels, as city-region, Eurodistrict, metropolitan area or regional government and national government. The latter two are more traditional, however these must be also interesting for other partners. On the other hand what is interesting for experts of Lille, how and what can be generalized in a European context from their multi-dimensional practice in order to initiate common policies at the EU-level. The other partners can change experiences from all the others as well, in order to see a relatively full variation of cooperation on the simultaneous models of Lille and testing relevance of these solutions on the example of others. During the implementation phase the table is supposed to be filled with crosses or other symbols indicated direct or indirect linkages between experiences of two or more participants of our project. 
The common learning process is focused on exchange of experiences on collecting social efforts in metropolitan areas for efficient policy implementation. Either working groups or Local Support Groups of partners are potential forums of the activity mentioned. The whole spectrum of known models and variables will be presented and individually relevant specific model or models are highlighted more rigorously. This background knowledge is going to be got by partners through specific themes, such as comparable case studies that will be studied and discussed at the metropolitan level. 
2.3. Transfer of good practices and dissemination of comparative knowledge. 
According partners’ expectations that has been tested in one of the first working group meeting, apart from formalized solutions, more practical instruments should be scrutinized by member-professionals. A list of ongoing initiatives and particularly preferred issues were collected as 
offer for introduction by each member in following seminars.
Motivation for cooperation in city-regions presented and offered for testing have already been listed. These are different in each particular city-region and based on local needs the definition of which must be a task for the Local Support Groups. However, at a first step, some crucial issues were identified by the WG members as to be considered during the implementation phase:
Lille - Enhancing the (public) metropolitan cooperation to private stakeholders
Florence - Mobility in city-regions
Sevilla - Externalities concerning operation of public utilities (functions of spatial planning)
Brussels - Promotion of cooperation between the Brussels-Capital Region and its economical hinterland 
Krakow - Tools of governance (planning and implementation)
Brno - Motivated innovation by planning
Bourgas - Politico-administrative and economic needs in restructuring
Eindhoven - Economic development program (‘Brainport Program’ as strategic planning)
Topics as subjects of cooperation which are good to be highlighted according to partners’ practice. These topics of discussion are classified in two ways as issue-based and method-based. 
The first is based on wider community issues which policy answers should be generated from (as it was seen in Figure 3.1). Issue-based topics are especially as follows:
managing mobility through public transports.
managing externalities in transport, solid waste disposal and waste water treatment, and water supply.
building up an actual knowledge-based economy through investments in education and research.
enhancing attractiveness through various initiatives including marketing.
promotion of social inclusion through participation and empowerment.
The second group of topics for discussion is oriented more on content and framework of different levels of cooperation. These method-based topics are especially as follows:
role of spatial and land use planning in the reduction of urban sprawl.
development of governance at metropolitan level.
international facilities in the wider Europe (networking, becoming centres of innovation, research etc.)
See Table 2.3 for grouping of topics. 
The work plan below outlines major activities to be undertaken by Joining forces. Due to the special nature of the working group in generating actions and dissemination of results, the agenda cannot be detailed too much in order to let possibilities to emphasize local needs in the process of the whole project. Basically major stages can be defined.
1- Kick-off meetings of Urbact Local Support Groups (ULSG)
Local Support Groups have been set up by each Partner. They can be existing bodies, and then their involvement in the project is added to their current tasks. Alternatively, a group may be established just for this purpose from delegates of interested counterparts. 
Output (i): setting up working local support groups 
2- Preparation of outlines of Local Action Plans. 
Action plans mainly aim at identifying ways to drive social resources to the development of competitiveness, sustainability and social cohesion in particular city-region. Motivated partners with special focus on their particular needs should highlight available financial sources, involvement of private stakeholders and define the relationships with the regional policy of the European Union. 
Output (ii): outlines involving on one hand local needs more precisely what is supported by stakeholders, and on the other hand basic instruments to supply these particular demands.


3- Exchange of experiences
Exchange of experiences is going in the framework of joint meetings of the working group involved particular LSG. International experiences are presented on the basis of the represented models in the working group. 
Output (iii): structured, model-oriented, comparative seminars for practitioners
4- Preparation of brief description about cases and future way of their development
The working group, on the basis of partner’s proposal summarizes the particular models from point of view of the realistic development and according to the common opinion of meetings. The aim is to present inputs for further preparation of details for local action plans.
Output (iv): summary case studies
5- Finalization of Local Action Plans
Partners present their Local Action Plans elaborated in details with their LSG. The purpose of the work is to strengthen the process of establishment different forms an mechanism of working city-region through public initiatives and governance, adjusted to the local needs and demands.
Output (v): Local Action Plans
6- Summary of local situations according to the model orientation
The working group collects and discusses model orientation presented in the group involving development strategies arisen and accepted by LSGs. As a conclusion, policy recommendation is made for European, national, regional and local authorities in order to enhance relevant policies based on governance of city-region areas in the European space.
Output (vi): atlas about some local situations which are cases of some defined models
Output (vii): policy recommendations

LC-FACIL. 
A working group to facilitate the implementation of integrated sustainable urban development according to the Leipzig Charter.

1. Introduction 
1.1 Main objectives of LC.FACIL. 
Although different in historic, economic, social and environmental situations European cities are currently confronted with, on the one hand, challenging and unprecedented financial/economic circumstances alongside increasing pressures to adapt to ever changing and complex demographic, cultural and migration patterns as well as social inequalities and environmental problems. On the other hand they hold the key for our future resilient economic strength and social cohesion in being the stimulus and the motor for the EU wellbeing in so many important aspects of life (they represent the economic and cultural core of a community and a focus for the provision of social educational and health services). 
For fully playing this role and functions on the one hand and successfully addressing the multitude of severe challenges, cities need to organise and steer complex integrated, cross-sectoral and participative urban development processes. The Leipzig Charter as well as the Leipzig Memorandum provides an important European policy paper with core principles and guide-lines for integrated urban development processes. The common under-standing of this URBACT working group proposal therefore is that the Leipzig Charter offers a clear focus to all the challenges mentioned above. However, the Leipzig Charter as a European policy document remains quite abstract and general. 
The organism of cities is very complex with many layers of inter-connected functions as well as diverse relevant public and private players and thus also integrated approaches are complex and difficult in terms of governance (multi-level and cross-sectoral) and participation/involvement. This is why cities are still struggling in really putting integrated urban development processes into practice. It is absolutely necessary to further ex-change on, develop and transfer successful tools for organising, implementing and monitoring integrated and sustainable programmes and processes for urban development which cut through traditional “siloed” working practices developing new multi–disciplinary structures working towards shared outcomes. 
The member states have started to discuss on and elaborate a concrete reference framework on sustainable urban development and set up an Institutional Working Group (MS/I). The activities and outcomes of the IWG as well as the study made for the French presidency build a good basis for jointly working in this URBACT working group towards a real practical reference framework for processes fed by the practical experiences and know how of cities in terms of already existing planning, governance and monitoring tools as well as important success factors and for prevailing short-comings and difficulties to overcome. By this, the next step for policy makers and City administrations across Europe can be achieved and the “Leipzig Charter” as strategic frame can be transformed into an implementation action plan for sustainable urban development which can be adopted across the EU. 
The concrete planning, governance and monitoring instruments need to be on the one hand innovative and on the other they need to be practical; sustainable development must not be seen as an “extra” task for re-generation practitioners but as the only way to ensure long term outcomes for the city. Therefore it is of utmost importance that existing instruments such as monitoring systems (e.g. in Leipzig, Göteborg and Rennes) are integrated into the European discussion and are being adapted to the needs of the LC. 
This Network therefore adopts the implementation of the Leipzig Charter as common goal and the recognition that we are all coming from different starting points as our basic premise. The situation of each city will be de-scribed in detail within the baseline Study which will be elaborated for each city during phase I. The Partnership is focused explicitly on a range of cities of differing scale (the scale of most European cities), context and structures to give a broad variety of situations, frameworks and also needs. It is important to mention that the results of this working group are useful for small and medium-sized European cities. 
Main objectives of the working group: 
1. Get a common picture of the “status-quo” 

2. Two way communication with the institutional working group (IWG) and transfer of local expertise and tools 

3. Constitution of test groups to experiment and further elaborate the envisaged reference framework as “Urban Laboratories” 

3. Expectations.

3.2 Which outputs do you intend to achieve with LC-FACIL concerning the interaction with the European level (the MS/I or other networks) and/or concerning the work on national / regional level?
Leipzig
Strengthening cities’ position in EU decision-making processes. The current dilemma between the principle of subsidiarity and direct participation of cities has to be solved. Whereas the urban dimension became part of the ERDF funding from 2007-2013, the quality of urban regeneration programmes often fell behind the successes of the URBAN-programme.
Reason for that was the influence of non-involved third parties as the national and regional levels, who are responsible for the design of funding programmes being the base for facing the urban challenges and the development of municipal opportunities. Cities as experts were not sufficiently involved.
Rennes Métropole
To define and test a framework on integrated urban development (both on planning and on implementation)
To contribute to the European policies for urban development
Rennes Métropole is a member of the CAAC. The working groups and commissions are based on the Atlantic Charter of San Sebastian adopted in 2008. The results and research on LC-Facil will serve as resources for Rennes Métropole participation into the CAAC.
Székesfehérvár
The core output could be a written material (some kind of guide book) about the opportunities, services and programmes concerning to bicycling in Székesfehérvár
Growing the role of bicycling in intra-urban traffic through raising awareness on the benefits of bicycling
Promotion of bicycle as a healthy, fast, cheap and environmentally friendly alternative mode of transport in daily public and tourist activities
Kirklees Metropolitan Council
Share good practice and expertise from across Europe in sustainable urban development – Kirklees is keen to learn from our partners and innovate.
Develop a fully integrated strategy for Kirklees
We see the LC – FACIL network as offering an ideal opportunity for us to develop solutions which can be replicable across the EU.
We are also keen to explore that potential to attract much needed funds for the development of a long term and Integrated Regeneration Programme for the town such as EU investment via JESSICA funding. We would like to see the work carried out as providing a vehicle to lobby for EU / UK Govn / Regional investment including potential for funds from European Investment Bank (EIB)
Our Planning services have agreed to undertake a detailed Area Action Plan (a formal Planning Framework) for the town centre of Dewsbury. Yorkshire Forward, the Regional Development Agency, have also agreed to invest in the development of a detailed urban design masterplan for Dewsbury (Renaissance) alongside substantial public consultation. So this represents the best possible opportunity to align the existing threads of regeneration for Dewsbury as a case study in sustainable urban development incorporating the principles behind the Leipzig Charter.
Göteborg
Our ambition is to spread the use of visualisation in urban planning and development in a way that stimulates a wide participation. Through visualisation it is more likely to achieve a common, shared view and understanding of both similarities and differences in respect to European sustainable urban development. That may in turn be the key to a more constructive interaction in urban development issues on a European level. This is what makes this project so important and strategic, by providing the “visualised framework”, if you will, for the European Reference Framework.
Bytom
Preparing of Local Development Plan as an operational programmes, related to the strategic road map (included in Development Strategy of Bytom).
Qualify, which priorities defined in the strategic road map are coherent with Leipzig Charter recommendations.
Need to build up and implement a monitoring and evaluation system, especially for an ongoing monitoring of not only the projects’ realization status but the whole development process.
Vitoria-Gasteiz.
The main expected output is a global framework for sustainable urban concepts, the creation of knowledge and best practice manager.

3.3 Summary of expectations and outputs
The following results and outputs could be defined on basis of the partners’ feedback through the baseline questionnaire:

Improvement of framework-conditions for integrated urban development on European, national and regional level.
More autonomy for the cities, regional budgets etc.
Knowledge-exchange on integrated approaches on different levels and stages of implementation (including the observation of effects).
Better methods of know-how-transfer between cities.
Benefit from training and empowerment actions for the local stakeholders.
Training session for local stakeholders.
Gain help to develop an integrated strategy for sustainable development / investment for the city and a focus for the realignment of funds.

8. Analysis and Conclusion.
Based on the city visits, the baseline questionnaires, the baseline study itself and in particular on the outcome of the two workshops, where the project’s main aims and issues were defined by all partners, the outlines of future process can be described as follows: 
Visualise and promote the benefits of the integrated approach for sustainable urban development – e.g. by means of a “reference framework” 
The identification of the partners experiences with integrated, sustainable urban development processes as well as an overview on the European state of the art regarding these issues showed, that various good practices, work structures and funding options are (to different degrees) in place over all in Europe. At the same time it became obvious, that there still is strong need for action to anchor these approaches on all different levels and overall in Europe. 
For this reason, partners came to the conclusion, the creation of a common understanding about the benefits of the integrated approach and its promotion will be one of the projects aims/issues. 
One important means to reach this aim will be the work on a “reference framework”, as an outcome oriented tool, which helps to visualise and prove the benefits of integrated approaches. This work will be imbedded in the first of four work packages - Diagnosis and Evaluation - but will at the same time accompany all other work packages (see below). The ideas during the ongoing process as well as the results will be inserted in the interaction with the MS/I group, bringing both an input from the cities group side as well as testing and defining a position towards the “reference framework” which will be proposed by the MS/I group.
Addressing challenges, which hinder a successful, comprehensive implementation of the Leipzig Charta 
As further challenges for the implementation of the Leipzig Charter, could be observed in the partner cities the three other work packages will aim to address this challenges and as a result formulate the needs of cities from their practitioners point of view. As they appeared to be quite similar to challenges the majority of cities are facing (according to a survey among member states representatives) the results of these work packages will be of interest also to other cities. They will be: 
Remaining sectoral thinking and lack of coordination within work structures and budgetary planning on all different levels – Finance and Cooperation 
Further need for action to link strategies with their implementation, define effective ways of observing the effects, while including and activating all relevant stakeholders – Strategy and Implementation. 
Learning from the implementation processes and adaptation of the implemented strategies and instruments according to current development tendencies – Review and Reassessment. 
Linked to the subjects of the work packages are the partner cities’ local action plans. While gathering existing good practices and experiences from all cities, those who are working on the subject will therefore be able to benefit from the work and result of the work package. 
Common positions and results will be elaborated for all work packages and will be discussed and disseminated apart from the MS/I group with National and European networks (as well as with the URBACT network) in order to gain a wider base for conclusions.

9. Main Outputs.
a. Identification of existing reference frameworks in the partner cities: 
All the partner cities have different experiences with the implementation of the objectives of the Leipzig Charter. There is no general RF but every partner has specific knowledge about different topics and within the group there are some “frontrunners” even on the Europe wide level. 
b. Clustering the main issues of integrated sustainable urban development into 4 work packages: 
Keeping in mind that the project aims are not to realize concrete projects but dealing with the general conditions for integrating the principles of the LC successfully there are some main focus points for successful implementation. 
c. Description of good practices, barriers and tools according to the work packages: 
Parallel to the good practice collection made by the MS/I and their technical experts the partner cities will show their personal good examples and they will highlight the barriers and the tools in their city. 
d. Provide cities needs in respect of the RF to the MS/I: 
Although the technical assistants provide the MS/I with good practice examples of the cities and although there are national support groups which bring in their individual national experience via cities of city-association, it is very important that the “end-users” – the cities – clearly show their expectations to a general RF in particular respecting the different stages of the implementation and experiences in the cities so far. Respecting the overlapping timetable of the MS/I and the LC-FACIL group the organisation of the work packages gives the possibility to disseminate first results of the main instruments (diagnosis & evaluation and finance cooperation) within the development phase of the RF. 
e. Test the RF within all partner cities: 
By using the LSG from each city as 7 different test groups, each partner city will experiment with the presented RF in respect to its main focus according to the work packages. Individual responses will be given by each city and a common statement of the group will be elaborated. 
f. Elaboration of 7 different LAP: 
Relating to the 4 main work packages of the project each partner city develops an own LAP. By doing so, each partner can use the different experience of the other partners and especially the work package leaders.

"LINKs Network. 
Foreword. 
Towards Future-Proof Historic Centres. It seems common sense to say that one can find in Historic Centres nearly all the elements that constitute the « eco-district » magic mix most city planners dream to build today. Indeed, their urban forms are incredibly thrifty in terms of use of space, local building materials, closeness of urban services, social and functional mix, etc. Still, the objective evaluation of such characteristics remain to be elaborated. What are we talking about? Looking for heritage-compatible energy performance solutions for the restoration of ancient buildings in Historic Centres. Let us leave aside the well researched symbolic, cultural and historic value of urban historic centres, and focus on the environmental value and performances of such districts. By environmental performance we mean the global balance assessment of infringements imposed to the environment by human activities at district scale (impacts on the climate, on the quality of water and air, and on the conservation of natural resources). Tools such as the Analysis of Material and Energy Flows are frequently used to quantify such impacts, by estimating the effects inferred by different types of urban shapes on human activities (dwelling, moving…), and their induced effects on the environment. The LINKS project’s ambition is not to study the environmental virtues of historic centres in all of their constituents: the project will concentrate on the question of the ancient housing environment, its intrinsic qualities, the ways to protect and/or improve them. The urban traffic, the impacts of tourism, or the functional, economic or social balances will not be analyzed in term of environmental impacts, but will be examined as indispensable urban quality factors to have inhabitants come back to and/or remain in historic centers, which they too often have been brought to leave during the recent decades. These elements indeed constitute urban control levers which cities should integrate to validate a holistic urban model before focusing on the validation of specific housing models. The depletion of energy ressources and the greenhouse gas emissions inferred by human activities are among today’s top level environmental concerns. These two impacts generally constitute the priority targets of local environmental policies. This is why the energy performances of ancient buildings and the improvement solutions that will prove to be compatible with the historic character of such constructions are a priority axis for the LINKs project partnership. The energy dimension will be studied throughout the life cycle of a building, while keeping in mind the need not to aggravate either the other environmental impacts. The notion of eco-restoration developed within the framework of the LINKs project will thus refer to the EU frame of reference concerning the Eco-conception of products (European directive 2005 / 32 / CE). Through the analysis of existing research, legal frameworks and policies as well as the experimentation of concrete local practices, the LINKs partnership wishes to build and share a common set of principles and tools that will help european cities to keep feeling the beating heart of their Future-Proof Historic Centres. 
Synthesis. 
Reality check « European and national bodies certainly need to make serious efforts to educate and persuade local officials. Yet at the same time, we need to ensure that new policies correspond to needs and that there are local capacities to implement them. There is a very large gap to fill, which globalization and the crisis seem to be deepening. » Jean-Loup DRUBIGNY 3 This quote encapsulates Urbact projects’ challenge as far as exchange and learning are concerned : the proposed approaches must bring new concepts to local officials while making sure our projects and proposals are rooted into partners’ everyday reality. This is why the project team adopted a twofold approach: each new top-down proposal is field-tested before the project adopts it ; and the project activities are built around and on the basis of partners’ actual local initiatives and projects. 
C1 Building a team & a common culture 
Indeed, since phase 1, all key decisions (image and logo, budget, choice of work-groups themes, places and dates of meetings, roles & responsibilities…) have been taken by partners on a collegial basis, either during the Steering committee meetings or through mail discussions ; and all key documents or elements are discussed and validated by the partners. This contributes to create the necessary sense of community. 
C2 Reaching a shared understanding of the problems and opportunities 
We also have spent, and will keep spending time making sure the terms we use make sense to all partners ; and to build a common vision of the problems we choose to face together. Some « problem tree » sessions already permitted the group to come to an agreement on the wording and the understanding of two initial issues : « The problems we meet when we want to improve the inhabitants’ quality of life the Historic Centre », and « The problems we meet when we trying to combine old & new materials and techniques for ecorestoration ».
 61.3 Defining a main common theme & complementary elements: A both integrated and hierarchised approach. 
The project’s specific and innovating starting point was identified from the beginning as a rather technical one: The problems generated by the need to apply Ecorestoration to ancient buildings in historic centres. But the everyday local reality shows us that the efficiency of any policy in this field is linked to the quality of the weakest segment of the proposed answer: We need to take into consideration and evaluate our municipalities’ ability to bring in effective results in each dimension of the problem: social, technical, urbanistic, economic, and governance). This emerged clearly from the answers to the questionnaires sent to the partners by the lead expert, as well as from the two european meetings held during the 1st phase. Indeed, for Historic centres to become sound & attractive eco-districts, and deserve LINKs motto (Future-Proof Historic Centres »), it interestingly enough appears that they must manage to reach Sustainable Development four targets: social/cultural, environmental, economic, and sound governance. This being said, we clearly keep in mind the hierarchy of themes we want to deal with during the project. We neither will have the time nor the resources to develop detailedly all of these aspects. We will therefore put more emphasis on exploring the technical challenges to eco-restoration. But we will also consider their interactions with the 4 other identified fields (social, urbanistic, economic, governance), and point out key challenges, and recommendations as well as the best practices that will have appeared during the process. The choice made by the LINKs partners for the selection of their local « Pilot Projects » shows clearly that this agreed hierarchy also corresponds to their local team’s concrete needs. LINKs’ five key challenges to create « Future-proof Historic Centres » Work Group 1: Eco-restoration in historic centres, the social challenges If the old European cities show some advantages to aspire to be tomorrow’s eco-districts - urban density, high architectural quality and thrifty constructions in natural resources, diversity and proximity of urban functions as well as economical, cultural and educational development potential – they also suffer from many liabilities to meet moderns needs. Buildings decay, tightness and discomfort of housing, noise pollution, commercial specialisation, pauperization and/or gentrification, tourism excess… This quest for a sustainable city and revitalization of ancient quarters ought to take in account the human factor. Aren’t the main actors of the city and « user experts » the inhabitants themselves? Inhabitants’ involvement in transforming their living environment will allow a better appropriation of those areas and will guarantee their longer-term quality and social cohesion. Inhabitants must be considered as stakeholders and associated during every stage of the urban project. Acceptance and success of a sustainable city vision depends on the way social expectations are understood and met. LINKS will dedicate the first chapter of its works programme to identify present inhabitants’ needs, and the successful ways to secure an active citizens’ participation. Work Group 2: Eco-restoration in historic centres, the urbanistic challenges Town planners in charge of historic centres must permanently keep a sound balance between heritage protection and demands for change. They have to imagine a new urban fabric, rooted in the past tracks, but open to future needs. This requires to precisely understand which are today’s needs (in terms of publics spaces, equipments, services, customers habits…), how they keep evolving and to define how these expectation can be compatible with sustainable development requirements. Two important questions today’s town planners have to face are on the one hand, the compatibility of the historic centre with cars, and on the other hand the “cost of fame”; how can historic centres deal with the liabilities generated by the success of tourism and cultural leisure activities. If mobility has been successfully dealt with in many cities (although the quality of the public answers varies with the size and context – predominantly urban or rural - of the city and the traditional relationship of citizens with their cars (which can be a strong cultural and regional factor), the conflict between activities and proximity services remains an issue in most historic cities. The balance to keep or to recover is always a subtle one. One key paradox is the fact that short term decisions often generate unforeseen and sometimes negative long term impacts. How can cities learn to better monitor urban planning strategies in a way that will preserve the desired balance in the long term or, when needed, restore it along the path? Work Group 3: Eco-restoration in historic centres, the technical and financial challenges to improve their attractiveness, city centres must offer credible alternatives to suburban housing. To repopulate city centres, one needs to offer healthy, comfortable and energy-efficient housing. If suburban housing remains an important grey energy consumer generating urban transports, it now requires less domestic energy, due to technical improvements and tighter standards. Historic areas are still exempted from greenhouse gas emissions directives, but the conjunction of the climate change emergency and a gloomy economic context creates a double threat for fragile Historic heritage: normalisation and standardisation of technical solutions. LINKs partners will have to define their protected architecture intrinsic environmental qualities: adaptation to the site (both in terms of urban and of architectural shapes and constructive modes), energy behaviour (using various methods, the reliability and limits of which will be studied), relevance of local material, resistance to earthquakes… The partners will make an analysis of ancient buildings heritage’s situation faced with the different standards to check if their implementation fosters the intrinsic qualities or destabilizes them. Then, the partners will identify the different solutions for eco-restoration. The analysis will determine, in a given context, energy performances’ objectives as well as opportunities for restorations respectful of building heritage and environment. The panel of technical solutions will be established in a way to emphasize the resources of traditional architectures (the part of the low-tech: natural, local and organic materials – passive climates) as well as the perspectives given by innovation (part of the hightech). Each partner will establish an inventory of financial tools which can be mobilized (national and local) to make eco-restoration a feasible solution. These financial tools will be submitted to a critical analysis to determine their adequacy to qualitative objectives (patrimonial and environmental), to define their limits and to point out possible perverse effects (indirect prescriptions, works or helped products’ costs increase). Work Group 4: Eco-restoration in historic centres, the economic challenges. All the work done on eco-restoration solutions would be useless if the emerging demand cannot be met by the local economic market. Once eco-restoration’s methods will be more precisely defined, local professional networks able and interested and associated in the different U.L.S.G. (architects, engineering consulting firms, tradesmen trained or to be trained, suppliers’ networks in adapted building materials …) will closely examine the economic viability of eco-restoration. In particular, the local resources and lacks (material, skills, training needs) will be clearly identified and the Local Actions Plans will be elaborated to foster the potentials and build the synergies that can contribute to fill in the lacks. Work Group 5: Eco-restoration in historic centres, the governance challenges The question of governance will be the general methodological framework overshadowing the project. Each of the other theme (social, technical, economic challenges), will be questioned along sound governance lines: citizen involvement, assessment of publics policies (this question will be attentively developed during the project due to the – stimulating Vs inhibiting – impact of public subsidies to private owner on local markets), relationships with other levels policy makers, synergies with stakeholders (PPPs…), etc Also, existing good practices in terms of governance will be exposed and assessed in the frame of this Work Group.  C3 Identifying local expertise, « Good Practices » and « Pilot projects »: A treasure in your backyard - Local Expertise Valuing local resources is indeed in line with our main objective. So when looking for expertise at project level, we have first looked into the local technical and academic resources associated to the ULSGs, which often proved to be pertinent and qualified. Their advantage, too, is that their language may be more easily accessible to the project’s target population: their peer local politicians, civil servants & stakeholders. This also permitted us, among other things, to identify qualified keynote speakers for 4 amongst the 6 scheduled european meetings. An interesting way to identify local expertise is to ask partners to look for their cities’ own good practices, along the project’s criteria. This is a first step in the evaluation process conducted by the lead expert with each partner (through questionnaire, visit, european meetings). - « Good Practices » : highlighting local solutions, in view of exchanging experiences On each proposed theme, once the problem is clearly set, the lead expert first asks the partners to look for existing local practices that do or may bring usefull answers to other partners. This research began during phase 1, and will continue during the 1st half of phase 2, particularly for the new partners. The identified Good Practices will then be assessed & compared and may later become Best practices, when so validated by the partnership. They then will be uploaded in the online LINKS data base. At the end of phase 1, the partners, assisted by the lead expert, had already identified a first series of 12 local Good Practices: 4 social challenges : Charters & applied methods fostering citizen participation . 3 governance challenges : 2 quality for integrated management, 1 project financing approach . 3 urban planning challenges : historic centre management & redevelopment plans . 2 technical challenges : eco-restoration of 1 ancient buidlings, 1 evaluation of energy solutions This was meant to help each partner in defining both their level of expertise and their own offers and demands as far as exchange of experiences is concerned. - Bilateral cooperations. Several bilateral cooperations on specific topics were born from the first exhanges on local expertise, which will be implemented during Phase2. For instance, Veria plans to send their future ecorestoration Counselling officer for a training visit at their counterparts’ offices in Bayonne and Kilkenny. C4 ULSG, OPMA & project work: Local stake-holders also welcome at European level The partnership decided to invite one ULSG member from each partner city to each european meeting and to the final conference. They will be chosen on the basis of each meeting’s theme and be asked to actively prepare and contribute to the seminar, particularly those in charge of keynote speaches. This way, no less than 54 ULSG members (9 persons x 6 meetings) will be invited to travel to LINKs european meetings. All partners’ OPMAs will also be invited to european meetings. Indeed, we will particularly insist on the importance of their presence at the 5th seminar (about OPs) and the final conference. Expertise: Fishing for complements As the baseline study shows, many initiatives exist around Europe and beyond, that can inspire our local policies and actions. We have proposed to several international, national and local specialised institutions and city networks to contribute to our work and later disseminate it, which they agreed to do. No need to say they are sources of expertise both for the project and local levels. Research at all levels Expertise –both local and european- will be used at different levels: - Project level : . All european projects will prepared & accompanied by at least one specialized expert. Also common technical researches will be developed jointly, mainly on the technical solutions for ecorestoration (assessment and comparison of different techniques and associations of materials/techniques used to eco-restore old buildings in different climatic and urban contexts). . Also a common research will be made on the situation and potential opportunities & recommendations for a better integration of issues related to eco-restoration in historic centres. - Local level: Each partner may use, in the frame of their own ULSG budget, expertise to deal with local challenges (eg. modification of legal frameworks, funding schemes (eg. PPP), technical issues). All these specific studies will be reported, shared and eventually disseminated 
C5 5 Permanent project-level « Work Groups » One Work Group will focus on each of the 5 themes. 1 central theme: . Technical challenges to eco-restoration in historic centres and 4 complementary themes: Social challenges to eco-restoration in historic centres. Urban planning challenges to eco-restoration in historic centres. Economic challenges to eco-restoration in historic centres. Governance challenges to eco-restoration in historic centres Each WG will be leadered by a team of two to three highly motivated partner cities that have received that mission from the 2nd steering Committee. For each work group, the other partners have either decided to join it as « active participants » (participating in the life of the WG) or to consider themselves only as « beneficiaries » of the outputs of the group. This system allows each partner to contribute to the project life while concentrating on their own priorities. It may occur that a partner chooses not to invest time in the animation of a WP, but has a recognized experience in the field. They then can be asked to contribute when needed as « expert ». Each WG will have & manage their own agenda, under the supervision of the lead expert and with the support of specialized experts : - organization fof the WG’s tasks and life - preparation of the european seminar dedicated to their own theme (one thematic seminar per semester see calendar) : seminar preparation, key-note speach/expert, PPs & GPs presentations, synthesis & report), - preparation of the presentation of their theme at the final conference - preparation of the outputs to be uploaded to the projects’ minisite and on line data base. C6 European meetings: a 4-steps approach to optimize their productiveness Short international meetings always set a productiveness challenge when participants come from different places and professional backgrounds, not mentioning the fact that several participants will not be used to intensive work in a foreign language. To make it both more efficient, nice and easy, all 6 european meetings will be based on the following sequence : Receiving inputs => Integration => Discovering local field reality =>Focusing back on one’s own needs => exchanging on self-chosen themes. . Day 1 : Plenary session & World Café workshops - 1/Receiving inputs Each european seminar will be introduced by a nearly one day long plenary session with presentations on the selected theme : key-note speach(es); presentations of pilot projects and/or good practices. - 2/Integration We will use for this, at the end of the plenary, a World Café approach (see annex), thus permitting each participant to ramble through the day’s inputs in an informal though efficient setting (small groups around meeting café tables, with specific assignments) and synthetize what was useful/striking to them. . Day 2 : Field visit & Open Space technology group work - 3/ Discovering local field reality The morning of the 2nd day will be dedicated to a visit of one or several local pilot projects and/or good practices; prior to the visit, the participants will be handed a questionnaire which will help them focus their attention during the visit. A debriefing session in small groups will allow the expression and collection of feedbacks to the local partner in a Peer Review spirit. - 4/ Focusing back on one’s own needs and exchanging on self-chosen themes For this last sequence, we will use a very efficient and motivating methodology: the Open Space Technology (see annex), which helps any community to self-organize a series of small groups focused on questions expressed by the participants themselves, rather than a preestablished agenda; the printed synthesis of each of the groups is made available to all by the end of the day. The seminars will end with a short plenary session for conclusions. Day 3 : Backstage management - 1/ morning : Meetings of all 5 work Groups (follow up on the work accomplished and preparation of future steps, pending questions) ; reports to the plenary. - 2/ afternoon : Meeting of the LINKs interegional Steering Committee (all partners represented, decision-makers being the political representatives; strategic, administrative & financial follow-up ; decisions) European meetings’ calendar: One theme at a time As we just exposed, each European meeting will be the occasion to highlight one of the projects themes. And the final conference will sum it all up. 28-30 September 2010, Freiberg (Ge) : « Governance challenges to eco-restoration in historic centres » 15-17 February 2011, Almeria (Sp): « Social challenges to eco-restoration in historic centres » 17-19 May 2011, Delft (Nl): « Technical challenges to eco-restoration in historic centres » 09-10 November 2011, Bayonne (Fr): « Economic challenges to eco-restoration in historic centres » 15-17 May 2012, Veria (Gr): « & Eco-restoration & Sustainable Urban Planning of historic centres, an issue for EU Operational Programmes ? » 28-30 September 2012, Anderlecht & European Parliament (Be): Final Conference « Eco-restoration, an asset for Historic centres’ sustainabe l development » C7 Group work methodologies: - Learning by doing All proposed methodologies for group work and animation are designed to be used not only during the european sessions but also to be brought back home by each partner to eventually use them in their own environment. This for, they are presented with support documents and practiced several times during the LINKs meetings. Eg. Problem tree & Perr Review were already used in phase 1, World café and Open Space Technology will be used extensively during phase 2 (see annex). - Remote group work: Online networking The partnership has created an intranet platform to facilitate direct exchanges among the project’s members, which should be transfered to the Urbact intranet at the beginning of the 2nd phase. It plans to extend it to permit all ULSG members to work as a european community of local actors. 
Conclusion 
I would like to conclude expressing my thankfulness to the highly motivated members and local partners of this incredible LINKs european team, who, in their own city daily work, as well as during all the –direct & remote- occasions of interaction offered by URBACT, have contributed in a very professional way to achieve this first step of the journey we all expect to keep sharing, in search of the keys to Future-Proof Historic Centres.

Land Use Management for Sustainable European Cities (LUMASEC).

1. Introduction. 
The aims of the LUMASEC Working Group. 
Cities in Europe are facing today major challenges: over 60 percent of the European population live in urban areas with more than 50,000 inhabitants. By 2020, about 80 percent will be living in urban areas, or much more, like in Belgium or the Netherlands, and the urban future of our continent is directly affected by urban land use. 
Also technological progress and market globalization are generating new challenges for European cities. Townscape and social structures are in fundamental transformation processes, and the use of land is shifting from decline in one area of a city or city-region to growth in another. 
Furthermore, the political framework of local stakeholders is shifting as well. The arena of decision makers in public and private sector is getting more fragmented. Cities have to cope with this, and small and medium sized cities in Europe especially have problems with this situation. Increasing number of brownfields and urban sprawl are visible signs of these processes. 
A sustainable land use management improves coordination of urban planning as well as public-public and public-private investments, it involves local stakeholders in common visions. Through land use management, cities and city-regions can benefit from the ongoing regional competition to overcome their lack of attractiveness and get competitive territory. 
LUMASEC is a network of decision-makers of small and medium sized cities, which is developing strategies of land use management for sustainable European cities. The network consists of local stakeholders of public and private sectors, and call up existing knowledge and experience. The outcome of the working group will be on the one hand a toolkit for local decision makers and, on the other policy recommendations for the European Union to focus on the framework the local decision makers are working in. 
On the basis of best practice studies, exemplary realisation of the knowledge in URBACT Local Support Groups and the involvement of municipalities and professional bodies in a kind of scientific support group, the working group is establishing knowledge processes on land use management for sustainable European cities.

2. Frameset and Trends in the EU. 
2.1. Land Use Management – a definition. 
Land and its subdivision 
Historically, the human society used to divide land in parcels or plots. Villages, cities and counties are all governed by setting affectations to parcels of land. Land is then subdivided into “pieces”, which can be easier sold or developed. Each affectation or designation of land, so called “zoning”, is determined by a list of approved uses to be legally operated on the zoned plot. All those affectations are regulated in the form of a governance document. In the capitalist system of land use, the signification of land property and its use is very high; land organisation reflects political, cultural and economic influence. 
Real Property 
This kind of property is referring to one of the main classes of the human property; the other properties are the personal and the intellectual ones. Real property is regulated by law in different sort of interests, like fee simple, fee tail, life estate, or leasehold. 
Land use and land use management system 
Land use can be seen as the human modification of natural environment or wilderness into built environment such as settlements, agriculture or pasture. By defining new functions to the land, also in term of changing the functionality of land, the human is transforming his environment consequently. The land structure resulting from this use of land has to be considered as the result and the mirror of his society and his culture, resulting of the action of different actors, mobile (households, companies) and immobile (communities, cities, investors). 
As management is the human activity meaning the action of people working together in the aim to accomplish desired goals, land use management is a process of managing use and development of land, in which spatial, sector-oriented and temporary aspects of urban policy are coordinated. Resources of land are used for different purposes, which may produce conflicts and competitions, and land use management has to see those purposes in an integrated way. Therefore, land management covers the debate about norms and visions driving the policy-making, sector-based planning both in the strategic and more operative time spans, spatial integration of sectoral issues, decision-making, budgeting, implementation of plans and decisions and the monitoring of results and evaluation of impacts. The Management System includes all processes, methods and tools used for organising, operating and supervising the urban environment including the factors influencing it. Management systems cover all phases from the visions behind the preparation of plans and decisions to their implementation and the monitoring of impacts. Planning practices, decision making processes and procedures, implementation and monitoring mechanisms and methods and tools used in the above-mentioned phases are all elements of management systems. In general, land use management is driven by various decisions taken at different levels of administration (local, regional, national). (EU Working Group, 2004) 
Often, short-term orientation is conflicting the long-term ones. Therefore, a sustainable land use management will improve coordination of urban policy as well as public-public investments and public-private investments, and involves inhabitants and local stakeholders in common visions. In doing so, sustainable land management should act in a multi-level governance structure between an operational project level and a strategic level of urban management. 
Land Use Planning 
Land use planning is probably one of the most well known instruments of land use management, representing and illustrating a public policy. It comprises different disciplines, and consists in the use of plans to control, regulate and manage the use of land in a way, which should be efficient and –actually- sustainable. 
Land use planning could be defined like a scientific, aesthetic, and orderly disposition of land, resources, facilities and services with a view to securing the physical, economic and social efficiency, health and well-being of urban and rural communities. 
Instead of “land use planning”, terms like “town and country planning, regional planning, town planning, urban planning, and urban design”, as well as “spatial planning”, are used. At the basic level, land use planning has to organise the zoning areas and the transport infrastructure, but can be used for economical, demographic, social and environmental and other means. 
Today, most of the land use plans are based on soil and building databases, using the resources of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Computer Aided Design (CAD). 
Towards an integrated land use management strategy 
Focussing on the aspects of strategic land use management, four aspects related to land use management have been identified: 
The occurrence of urban sprawl and its negative impact in ecological, economical and social dimension, 
The existence and increase of urban brownfields, 
The lack of attractiveness of urban structures and 
The demand of competition on investment and locations of European cities and regions. 

The four aspects are the key drivers of land use management and the basis knowledge of the LUMASEC problematic, which are described in the following chapters.

2.3. Problematic of Strategic Land Use Management 
Problems of Land Use Management in European Cities 
Land Use Management concerns all levels of government: local, regional, national, European, international; it should involve all stakeholders, integrate and respect their tasks, roles, competences and principles. Land Use Management is a strategic asset to develop sustainable cities and to develop their attractiveness and competitiveness. 
As already seen before, land use management has direct impacts on attractiveness and competitiveness of the European Cities: the competitiveness of urban regions can be altered by a lack of land-use management strategy. 
The urbanization of new places without recycling brownfield and without urban renewal affects the global urban region attractiveness. The urban sprawl increases the pressure on non-urbanised areas (agricultural or natural spaces). 
Furthermore, a lack of land use management can also have consequences on economic development. Because the land is a limited asset, the search of a better use is a real issue. The potentialities of development can be deeply altered by ignoring potential use land conflicts. To develop projects “au fil de l’eau” can lead to not use the total potential of valorisation of strategic places. As example, to accept a commercial development will limit the possibility to develop high technology firms around because they give a high attention at the firms located in their environment. (Dormois, 2007) 
Post-industrial city regions are concerned by the thematic of land use management with a particular pregnancy. In these types of urban regions, large industrial or urban brownfields need to be recycled. The capacity of recycling is directly impacted by public budget and by local technical knowledge but not only. The regeneration of those spaces will be more difficult if new economic or housing zones are urbanized in other municipalities. The land cost in recycled areas is higher than in extension areas. Developing projects on a brownfield is still more complicated than urbanizing agricultural fields. But municipalities located around old industrial cities want to keep their development: their elected officials do not accept to stop urban growth (population, jobs). 
European cities meet difficulties to define and to implement land use management strategies 
The capacity of local authorities in developing land use management is limited by the institutional fragmentation. Land use management needs to be developed at large scale to be efficient. As example, the efficiency of city’s centre brownfields recycling is directly affected by the decisions of other municipalities to open new urban development areas. 
Strategic master plans, if they exist, formulate general goals and objectives concerning land use management. But this documents by becoming more strategic than spatial are less precise concerning the localisation of the new urban development areas and concerning which projects will be developed on this spaces (housing, economics,…). Furthermore, institutions or organisations, which are in charge of master plan elaboration have not the competences to implement them. Municipalities or inter-municipalities institutions keep the control on operational projects. The articulation between strategic planning and operational project is a big issue in the land-use management. 
Strategic master plans precise global objectives for the urban development but they do not give the operational guidelines to permit the integration of those general objectives at operational projects. As example, the control of urban sprawl by promoting a higher density in new housing settlement is a common orientation in actual strategic plans. But suburban or rural municipalities have no experienced concerning the production of real estates with density. They do not have technical expertise and they must face to economic constrains: the land price is not enough high to generate “spontaneously” the building of flats in new projects. 
The developers, the investors contact local authorities to develop new projects. Elected officials and technicians meet difficulties to find the equilibrium between short time responses to this solicitation and a land use management at long time. Sometimes, projects too rapidly accepted have limited the development of a strategic area. The difficulty in land-use management for local authorities is to be able to keep an operational dynamic without denaturing the strategic places. The land is a limited asset. A strategic land use management can lead local authorities to not develop an operational project because of preservation issues or because of the necessity to produce a global urban project. 
According to the LUMASEC problem tree, the issues of Urban Sprawl, Urban Brownfields, Lack of Attractiveness and Demanding Competition on Investment and location are the four main topics related to the Strategic Land Use Management and are described in the previous chapters.

2.5. Methodological framework 
Framework for Land Use Management 
The framework for land use management covers different levels of intervention and different instruments or tools, the level of influence of different actors, as well as their vertical and horizontal integration. 
Urban Planning and Land Use is made in general through the working forces of actors in the society and the market places: decisions on locations and investments, quality levels and yield expectations, preferences and habits decide on land use. Public actors react on those developments or demands and offer infrastructures and legal prerequisites for a further development. This was a way of planning in the past, and is still a way of working today, especially in the actual conditions of growing and shrinking of European cities. 
Mechanisms of policy intervention on land use 
As already mentioned, public and private actors have the ability to work on processes and to develop actions on spatial and society-related developments. Especially the public actors are required to take decisions and develop policies. 
But also the way, how the public actors have to tackle problems and strategies, is important; three ways can be identified: acting directly, indirectly and controlling/structuring. 
- Acting directly: public actors are intervening in direct investments, like in the building of new infrastructure, new parks, or new transports lines. 
- Acting indirectly: public actors are using existing instruments or developing new instruments, also financial, which can give a kind of framework for urban development, like reduction of tax 
- Controlling: public actors are creating instruments or organisations, which will influence e.g. the creation process of a project, like the launch of a citizen’s forum or a communication strategy. 

Private actors will not be able to intervene in such a broad way; however, their interventions could be also seen on a direct level (e.g. direct investments, “private initiative”) or on an indirect level (decision on industrial location, connected with new jobs and economic development). 
Instruments typology 
Actors have a big range of instruments to accomplish actions in land use, which can not be isolated considered, should be connected to the mechanisms of policy intervention and identified as follows: 
- Direct instruments: Real Estate Market interventions, Location development (Infrastructure building, urban renewal). 
- Indirect instruments: legal instruments of land regulation, Communication infrastructure, financial structures and incentives. 
- Controlling instruments: governance, process management and co-operation. 

Real Estate Market Interventions 
Through interventions in the Real Estate Market in form of direct investments, cities and regions can influence their land use development on a very efficient way. Especially the purchase of plots and land, (old) buildings, brownfields, key locations, combined with an active market policy can be an interesting tool of land use management. In this context, cities may develop some influence in the implementation of European regulations related to Urban Environment or Health, but also develop projects on the

Through interventions in the Real Estate Market in form of direct investments, cities and regions can influence their land use development on a very efficient way. Especially the purchase of plots and land, (old) buildings, brownfields, key locations, combined with an active market policy can be an interesting tool of land use management. In this context, cities may develop some influence in the implementation of European regulations related to Urban Environment or Health, but also develop projects on the workshops, working groups, task forces, competitions, public relations, sponsorships, or forums. A very interesting initiative in Germany is the organisation of “Salon Gespräche”, so “Salon talks”: organised during exhibitions or concerts, where two or three experts are invited to discuss an urban topic in a relaxed atmosphere, open to the public. 
Also communication initiatives involving schools are very interesting, in asking the “voices” of children; municipalities can invite schools or classes to work on a specific topic, like “quality of life in my municipality” and discuss it in the city council. 
Public incentives, financial support 
Financial support in form of subsidies has been always a method of urban development, also the European Level is using this instrument, for instance with ERDF founding. Founding experience in Germany and Europe during the last years shows us, that a 100% financial support is not realistic; much more, the participation on the regional and the local level in the planning and realisation process of private actors, stakeholders or foundations have much better results. This could be achieved with urban contracts, Public-Private Partnerships or combining it with legal instruments. 
Public financial incentives or disincentives can influence urban development and be used as an instrument of land use planning, for instance to limit urban development and urban sprawl. In the case of financial incentive, public actors may decide taxation systems on land or infrastructure, to reduce or increase attractiveness of locations in comparison to another one. Example in Germany is the case of the Ruhr Area, where special incentive for re-conversion of brownfields areas, have been attributed to investors. Public financial taxation systems can be also applied to road and infrastructure. 
Related to this, the model of public-private-partnership in the case of road infrastructure and road pricing, a model used more and more in France and Germany, has to be carefully studied and developed: this cooperation form may encourage urban sprawling, making for instance areas accessible for private companies. Spain is experiencing this model today, and the results are not really convincing. 
Governance 
Public actors governance can be seen as the “exercise of political authority and the use of institutional resources to manage society's problems and affairs” (World Bank Definition). Governance means therefore the process of “transmission” of process-oriented elements and administration, and is completing the mission of the politicians. 
In general, governance can be operated in three directions: 
- Organisation of networking and public-private-partnerships, 
- Using market mechanisms and principles (see 
- Developing top-down methods involving regional and local public actors 

Before development of Governance concept for regional or local actors, a stakeholder is should be executed.
7. Conclusions and expected results of LUMASEC 
The contents of the Local Action Plans and the Knowledge and Dissemination Plans of LUMASEC have a broad field of actions and projects; basis knowledge and questionnaire results from the partners highlight that a strategic land use management for sustainable European cities should deal with four “knowledge pillars”: 
- Data Information 
- Governance 
- Involvement of people 
- Products, like Toolkit for municipalities on land use management. 

Data Information 
Management of Data and how to deal with the information structure: these are the challenges of this knowledge pillar. It is not the question, how much information, but much more, what kind of management strategy with the data pool has to be followed. The discussion fields are the occurrence of urban sprawl and the land use management. 
Governance 
The second topic is related to the questions of governance and the practice of public private partnership (PPP) connected with the questions of land use management and sustainability. Network and Partnerships mechanisms should be the essence of the management process. 
Involvement of people 
The third topic is related to participation and implementation of land use management. Citizen’s participation has to be considered as the key to success of planning implementation, sharing vision and reality. Municipalities or regional bodies should learn from this process and should be able to share public interests with inhabitants. 
LUMASEC products 
Finally, the forth knowledge pillar is dedicated to a Toolkit for local stakeholder as well as policy recommendations to municipalities, regional bodies and European Union. 
The purpose of this Land Use Management Tool Kit will be to assist municipalities and interested citizens in the purpose of sustainable land use. The Tool Kit will help municipalities to identify the benefits of pro-active planning, actions required and resources available to help.

MAPS

Military Assets as Public Spaces 

2 State of the art 
2.1 General introduction 
The MAPS project aims to develop tangible and integrated strategies addressed to the management and enhancement of former military site, “one cultural heritage” that for a long time has been excluded from the active life of the European cities. This vast cultural heritage is made up of different type of objects: barracks, compounds, fortifications, towers, administrative buildings, buildings for officers and others, which exhausted their “defensive purpose” are now able to play a new role within our cities and territories (historical centers, limits of the city, urban landscapes and landscapes).
How can we revitalize the former military areas as a new urban hub for the social cohesion and the urban growth?
Many of these heritage are already owned by the city administrations, but many are still in a phase of change of the new ownership, e.g. from the National Defence Agency to the administrations of the cities. This fact highlights how in this historical moment there is still no full awareness by the local administrations of the cities, respect to the values (cultural, social and economical) expressed by these particular cultural heritage, in fact in many cases the Administrations, who hold of these former military assets, have never thought the realization of strategic projects for their integrated regeneration. 
Due to a period of over-building, enlargement of the limit of the cities and discriminated consumption of land, the issues of the re-use and the re-generation, in particularly of the former military heritage, become important to experiment new methods, tools and approaches for the development of an European urban agenda oriented to the integrated reuse of the urban fabric. Starting from these structural factors, and adding the factor of the global crisis, which has heavily affected the real estate market, it is easy to assume that the interest forward the former military heritage will be larger than the construction of new buildings, public spaces and infrastructure. 
In this framework, reuse of the former military heritage, to avoid a failure of the planning tools, we must have the vision that we need to change the approach toward the valorisation of these areas of the city. It is clear that the current urban planning tools, used for the “normal management “of the city, are not appropriate for the management of these new urban realities. 
The former military heritage are a particular part of the city, as mentioned above, that for a long time has been excluded from the active life of the city, and for this reason we need to establish “new strategies” for the re-appropriation: involvement of the inhabitants, identification of a possible temporary reuses of the areas, development of co-design activities, basically promote the social inclusion. 
For all these reason, in this section of the Baseline Study, we want to highlight the state of the art, regarding the enhancement of the former military assets, starting from the EU suggestions (charter, strategic documents, urban agenda) and from real projects (best practices) developed on the field. The idea is to create a strong relation between this two souls (theoretical and practical) to develop a practical tool (handbook) that will become a road map for the MAPS partners during the evolution of the project.

2.2 Leipzig Charter on sustainable European cities To start the approach to the theme of the reuse or regeneration of the former military heritage first we want to highlight the “Leipzig Charter on sustainable European cities”. This document1, developed in 2007, contains a series of considerations, compared to the challenges and opportunities, in which the European cities have to provide a develop solution, in particular in the field of: the management of cultural heritage, the integrated management of the built environment, the social inclusion and in the development of new economical mechanism. 
In this charter of intent, the cities were considered as an integrated system, in which promote the exchange of knowledge, the growth and production the social and technological innovation, but at the same time, the Leipzig Charter underline that the cities suffer from demographic problems, social inequality, social exclusion of specific population groups, lack of affordable and suitable housing, and environmental problems. 
Starting from these point of view, the Leipzig charter, has been focused on the required development of an integrate approach (integrated urban development policy) for the management of the city. The integrated urban development policy is a key prerequisite for the implementation of the EU Sustainable Development Strategy2 (EU SDS) that start from the involvement of the local urban actors (stakeholders) in close cooperation with the public sectors. 
Leipzig Charter / Integrated approach / What is important for the MAPS project! The approach to the integrated urban development policy is crucial for the partnership of MAPS network. In this approach we need to consider to work with two different scales of interest: the tangible aspect, related to the physical space (buildings, open spaces, etc.), the intangible aspect, related to the involvement of the stakeholders (economic actors, public sector, local communities, professionals, etc.). Starting from this approach the MAPS project will achieve the main goals through the following points: • describe the strengths and the weaknesses of cities and, assessment of the project area in relation to the city; • define a consistent development objectives for the urban area (project area) and develop a vision for the city (work with different scale of vision, local and for the entire city); • coordinate the vision of the project area with the current planning tools (Master Plan, strategic plan, etc.) to promote a well-balanced development for all the urban sectors of the city; • involve the local stakeholders who can contribute substantially to shaping the future from the economic, social, cultural and environmental quality, for the project area and for the city.
Leipzig Charter themes / What is important for the MAPS project! 
Creating and ensuring of high-quality public spaces. The quality of the public space is one of the most important indicator for the quality of the living environment. In the case of the regeneration of the former military heritage we are in front to the possibility to create a new public space, or network of public space and buildings, using a strategy that combines the aspects related to cultural, economic, technological, social and ecological issues. In the Leipzig chart this approach is identified with the term Baukultur3. 
Modernizing infrastructure networks and improving energy efficiency. The regeneration of the former military heritage, represent an important challenge in terms of experiment and use of new technologies to improve the energy efficiency. The buildings within in the military area, built to be flexible, can be easily regenerated, using the new technologies for the energy efficiency (retrofitting). From the point of view of the urban pattern, the reuse of the former military areas represent an important resource for the development of a new model of compact settlement structure for the reduction of the land consumption. Strengthening the local economy and local labour market policy. The regeneration of the former military areas are a strategic element in the urban agenda of the city of the network MAPS, in fact most of these areas are in the centre of the city, or very close to the populated districts and very close to infrastructures (train station, bus station, etc.). All this issues are important to support the development of new start-up and new businesses. Work inside to a dense urban pattern improves the quality of the ideas of the start-up, supporting the relations with other urban actors and allowing the access to a low prices for the workspaces. Proactive education and training policies for children and young. This theme is important for the identification of possible functions to insert in the former military areas. In this sense we can imagine to develop in this areas different type of training activities (Urban Hub) for the local communities or for the new users of the area. The children and young should be the main beneficiaries of these training policies, in facts they must be considered as key players to bet on for the re-appropriation of these areas.
2.2 Toledo Declaration 
This document4, developed in 2010, is been focused on the topic of the “integrated urban regeneration” as a new challenge for the European cities. The Toledo declaration was developed starting from the experience of the Leipzig Charter adding to the previous themes (integrated approach) the issue related to the urban regeneration. The main purpose of the declaration is summed in this statement contained in the document: 
“Toledo Reference Document on integrated urban regeneration and its strategic potential for a smarter, more sustainable and socially inclusive urban development in Europe” 
In order to develop a possible approach (more sustainable, socially, inclusive and smart) to enhance the European cities, these are the features of the Toledo Declaration which focus the attention: 
1. implementing integrated urban development strategies with a global and comprehensive vision of the city mixing the different tangible and intangible layers of the city;
2. taking into account the need to improve the economic performance, the eco-efficiency and social cohesion of the existing city, in order to achieve the general aims and the specific headline targets5 set out in the Europe 2020 strategy; 3. assuring citizens’ quality of life and welfare in all the existing communities and neighbourhoods of the city, stressing the need of their involvement in urban development through the participatory approach; 4. recalling the recommendation to reflect and take due account of climate change as expressed in the Europe 2020 strategy itself and in the Marseille Declaration; 5. supporting the acknowledgment of the importance of the renovation and physical upgrading of the existing housing stock from different perspectives; 6. taking into account the commitments set out in the Leipzig Charter with regard to paying special attention “to deprived neighborhoods within the context of the city as a whole” (this aspect is important for the MAPS project).; 7. recalling that the overall urban quality is determined by the quality of public spaces and architecture and is an essential requirement for establishing a pleasant urban environment; 8. stressing the convenience and effectiveness of spatial and urban planning as a policy lever for integrating environmental, social and economic objectives; 9. taking into account the suitability of the urban reuse, or compact city planning, to minimize the land consumption for a better managing the urban sprawl.
Toledo declaration / Urban regeneration / What is important for the MAPS project! Implementation of an integrated urban development strategy. Like in the Leipzig Charter, in the Toledo Declaration it is highlighted the need to identify an approach for the urban development, oriented to the creation of a shared vision between the different areas of the city (new settlements, historical center, etc.). In this framework the regeneration of the former military heritage is an important feature aimed to the development of an urban fabric where redesign the solutions with the involvement of the local stakeholders and reinforce the urban connections within the city. Involvement of the local stakeholders. This factor is crucial for the success of the integrated urban development strategy. In this sense it is important to highlight that the involvement of urban actors can be of two types: co-design of solutions for the urban regeneration or direct participation in the activities on the field. For the regeneration of the former military heritage these features are important to promote the social inclusion. Working with the local stakeholders means working to support the re-appropriation of these areas by the whole city. In this sense it is important to be able to communicate to the local stakeholders the integrated value (cultural, social, economical) expressed by the heritage to regenerate. Urban recycling / reuse. This item is related to the improvement of the tangible components of the city (public and private buildings and open spaces) that are not used or are underused. The reuse of the former military heritage will be a strategic approach to minimize the consumption of the land.

"MILE.
Managing Migration and Integration at Local Level.
Mile seeks to establish a thematic partnership network of 9 Cities and its Managing Authorities, which is based on the need to develop an integrated exchange programme relating to the theme of ""Managing migration and Integration at local LEvel - Cities and Regions (MILE)"". The overall goal of the project is to assist partner cities to develop and identify good practice project proposals for possible funding from ERDF, ESF or other EU or National sources of funding.   Mile is based on the need to develop an integrated exchange programme focusing on the definition of a Local Action Plan relating to the theme of Managing migration and Integration at local level.
For this purpose, the project will address and develop the three following agreed subthemes:
Enterprise development ;
Active inclusion in the labour market;
Access to services and intercultural dialogue.

Foreword.
MILE was an extremely positive experience for the city and for the managing authorities that took part. By publishing a handbook on the implementation of the URBACT projects we hope that others will benefit from the lessons learnt during the course of this pilot project. It is in the very nature of a pilot project to try out new paths, changing direction if necessary, and to transfer the experience acquired – highlighting successes as well as eventual errors made - to others embarking upon that same route. This experience-sharing also meets the request for capitalisation advanced by the European Commission which we thank, together with the Urbact secretariat, for having given the City of Venice and other partner cities the opportunity to take part in this pilot project. The MILE project represented a major investment for my city in terms of human resources, an investment that produced interesting results. They included the launch of action-planning processes and significant measures for the involvement of stakeholders as well as coordination with various levels of government (Region and Province in particular). This work will not conclude with the project but will continue in the near future with the implementation of several of the actions in the local action plans developed within the MILE framework. Within the Municipality of Venice the project acted as a stimulus to begin developing and reinforcing collaboration between the various departments working for the integration of immigrants, in particular between the Social Policies department – Immigration Service, Economic Development department and Educational Policies department, coordinated by the European Policies department. The success of the MILE project was the result of the input and commitment of all partners and of the competence of the experts who provided us with support in developing contents and methods. We thank them all and hope that we will have the opportunity to repeat these shared experiences in the near future. I strongly believe in the value-added that European level cooperation can bring to cities, and subsequently to European citizens, and I strongly hope that the European Commission continues to invest in this type of experience.  MILE is a Fast Track Network of the URBACT thematic pole “Social inclusion and Governance”. The objective of MILE project is to produce local action plans for managing migration and integration, on the themes of: - Enterprise development and support - Active Inclusion for labour market access - Access to Education, Health and Housing services and intercultural dialogue The term ‘Fast Track Network’ means that it aims at bringing best practice ideas faster into the mainstream by linking the action plans produced to the finance available in the Operational Programmes of the European Structural Funds. Different elements combined to ensure successful implementation of the MILE project: the use of a process approach rather than a blueprint approach continuous evaluation of the process for learning and taking “rapid adaptive action” active involvement of MAs and Local Support Groups in all stages of the project experts individualized support for project partners.  
VI. Conclusions 
The 24 local action plans produced in MILE project have created an impact at local level, in terms of: rethinking the provision of services to migrants and ethnic minorities and undertaking the necessary organisational changes to adapt these services building the capacities of cities to intervene in the management of migration and integration, and transferring the knowledge acquired in the MILE process to local policies, programmes and actors scaling-up local action plans to policy level and integrating them into mainstream services raising awareness and access of cities to the Operational Programmes of the European Structural Funds securing funding through the Operational Programmes of the Structural Funds in order to guarantee implementation of the local action plans, as a path to affecting migration and integration policy Most importantly, the process contributed in creating enduring partnerships, vertically between different levels of government as well as horizontally with sister departments and municipalities, thus strengthening governance. However more impact could have been achieved if partnerships between Managing Authorities of the partner countries were created. URBACT II projects can be an important opportunity for enhancing the institutional capacity of Managing Authorities to evaluate the effectiveness of the projects funded by the Structural Funds, and hence ensure that Structural Funds are making a difference and are used effectively for sustainable development, not to merely finance one-off projects which influence ends with the ending of the funds. This can be done by consolidating MA-MA partnerships through horizontal transfer of good practice and tools between regions. The MILE project concentrated on vertical cities-Managing Authorities cooperation, but experience showed that horizontal MA-MA cooperation could have had an added value to both cities and MAs, as well as the entire URBACT II programme and fast track initiative. It is important that future URBACT II projects plan exchange and learning activities specifically for the Managing Authorities participating in the projects and that these activities be linked to building their capacities for evaluating effectiveness of the use of Structural Funds. 

Enterprise development for migrants and ethnic minorities There are a number of factors that push migrants/ethnic minorities towards  entrepreneurship, ranging from an interest in self -employment and enterprise creation as  such, to high levels of unemployment combined to social exclusion and discrimination.  Self -employment or enterprise creation is seen as a major alternative to unemployment. There are also many barriers that prevent this target group from becoming entrepreneurs, namely access to finance, unawareness of mainstream or specific enterprise support services and access of existing businesses to a wider market other than that of the same ethnic group. The vast majority of support services do not have any special arrangements for migrant and ethnic minority entrepreneurs and if they exist, they do not reach the target  groups. A lack of marketing skills is another obstacle. Most businesses are focused on speciality products and services for clients from own ethnic group.   
2.  ACTIVE INCLUSION MEASURES FOR LABOUR MARKET ACCESS 
2.1 Trends in active inclusion ‘Active Inclusion’ is the term used to describe policies and programmes which aim to bring into the labour market those people who are furthest from it. Active inclusion is  where the fight against poverty and social exclusion comes together with the goal of  economic growth. Active inclusion is a key means of achieving one of the European  Union’s main economic goals (increasing the number of jobs and people in work)  and one of its primary social goals (lifting individuals out of poverty through  employment).  Active inclusion fits readily within the EU framework of the Lisbon Strategy for Growth and Jobs. The Lisbon Strategy, now relaunched as the Partnership for  Growth and Employment, was relaunched in 2005 with just two headline targets:  To achieve total investment of 3% of Europe’s GDP in research and development  by 2010;   To achieve an employment rate of 70% by 2010. Each Member State is working through their National Reform Programme (the Member State level programme for delivering the European Employment Strategy) to achieve these targets.  In parallel, the establishment of a comprehensive approach to social inclusion using  the open method of co -ordination, has set the framework for the National Action  Plans for social inclusion (NAP -inclusion), now streamlined with social protection  measures resulting in the 2006 submission by Member States of the first National  Reports on Strategies for Social Protection and Social Inclusion. Active inclusion also fits within the more recently adopted ‘flexicurity’ approach to  managing labour markets. Flexicurity is one model for achieving a balance between flexibility in the labour market and security of income and social position for citizens.  Member States are expected to develop comprehensive policy strategies covering  the four components of flexicurity, which are:  Flexible and reliable contractual arrangements through modern labour laws,  collective agreements and work organisation  Comprehensive lifelong learning strategies to  ensure the continual adaptability  and employability of workers, particularly the most vulnerable;  Effective active labour market policies that help people cope with rapid change,  reduce unemployment spells and ease transitions into new jobs;  Modern socia  security systems that provide adequate income support encourage  employment and facilitate labour market mobility. This includes broad coverage  of social protection provisions (unemployment benefits, pensions and healthcare)  that help people combine work  with private and family responsibilities such as  childcare .  The Commission recognises that despite being one of the richest regions in the  world, social exclusion remains a substantial problem for the European Union:  16% of Europe’s population is at risk of financial poverty;  20% live in sub -standard housing;  10% of the population live in households where nobody works  ;  Active inclusion is intended to support the labour market integration of those who are  excluded from or experience disadvantage in entering  the  labour market.  This generally includes the following groups of people:  Older people (aged 50 and over)  Women  Young people (aged 15 to 24)   Migrants and ethnic minorities  Lone parents  People with disabilities  People with no skills or qualifications Active inclusion combines three main strands of activity: 1. Ensuring the adequacy of  minimum income schemes  through recognition of the  basic right of individuals to have sufficient resources to live in dignity, and by  practical implementation of this right. 2. Realising the potential of  inclusive labour markets by breaking down barriers to the labour market for people who are excluded from it, by reviewing incentives  and disincentives from the tax and benefits systems to make sure that  work pays,  and by supporting the inclusion of disadvantaged people in the labour market by  tackling demand side barriers including through anti -discrimination legislation. 3. Improving  access to quality social services  by ensuring that services are  accessible (available and affordable). This strand covers all public services and  particularly social security and health services, plus services which play a  preventative and socially cohesive role and facilitate social inclusion, including  support services people facing personal challenges (e.g. unemployment, debt,  alcohol or drug addiction), services to ensure that people are able to integrate  into society and the labour market (e.g. language training for migrants), and  social housing. The Commission sees the  EU financial instruments, particularly the European Social  Fund  (ESF),  playing  a  key  role  in  delivering  active  inclusion  policies. The Commission is encouraging the use of ESF programmes to support active  inclusion in three ways: a) Developing and testing integrated pathways to active social and economic  inclusion b) Mainstreaming innovative integration approaches that have a clear advantage  over current practices c) Disseminating and transferring good practice in promoting social inclusion ac ross  all Member States.  A 2006 overview of reports by national independent experts on social inclusion highlights two key common trends across the Member States in social inclusion approaches. Firstly, a shift towards holding individuals more responsible for their well being. This can be seen in increasing conditionality in relation to the eligibility of cash  benefits, but also in other spheres. For example, the German Immigration Act has  made language courses for immigrants compulsory. A second trend is in focusing anti-poverty strategies more sharply on specific groups. Immigrants are a specific target group in many Member States, while child poverty and pensioner poverty are  also frequently targeted groups.  2.3 What works in active inclusion? There is a mass of evidence about what works in active inclusion, and particularly  about what works in terms of active labour market policies. Evidence suggests that;   A strategy of ‘mutual obligations’ has played a central role in achieving greater mobilisation of labour resources in some countries. Governments have assumed  a duty to provide jobseekers with effective re -employment services , counselling,  training and financial incentives to enable them to find work  – the ‘rights’ side of  the approach. Beneficiaries, in turn, have had to take active steps to find work or  improve their employability, or else face the risk of benefit sanctions  – the  ‘obligations’ side of the approach.   Lifelong learning can contribute to high economic growth, while also reducing  poverty and mitigating inequality. There is strong evidence that trained workers have better employment prospects than those who have not received training.  Also, training facilitates transitions from temporary work arrangements into stable  employment. But access to training is distributed very unequally over the adult  workforce in all countries: those with the least education and skill s participate  much less in training. Relatively simple and cost effective initiatives designed to improve matching and  enhance job search appear to have a significant impact in terms of helping  participants to move more quickly into employment...Training  programmes  produce employment outcomes which are often no better than job -search - focused initiatives. They also often fail to boost hourly earnings and are far more  expensive. There is no convincing evidence that work programmes improve the  employment chances of participants, and recruitment subsidies are a very  expensive way of boosting employment and often suffer from low take up. It is estimated that a 10% increase in active labour market policy spending per  unemployed person reduces by 0.4% the unemployment rate. Early intervention cuts the long term costs of unemployment, associated ill health and social  exclusion  .  Examples of good practice in social inclusion which are highlighted in the 2006  overview of reports by national independent experts on social inclusion  include the  following: Good practice in reaching marginalised groups:  The ‘joint responsibility’ initiative in Denmark;  Social integration centres in Poland;  Dutch initiatives for the homeless and drug addicts which involve volunteer work  and subsidised labour;  Spain’s Active Insertion Benefit. Good practice in supporting excluded families:  A family support programme implemented in Latvia from 2005 -06, targeting  unemployed parents;  A Czech Republic project, The Effects of Family Upbringing’, which focused on  providing work opportunities to people from dysfunctional families. Good practice in local initiatives:  The German federal programme ‘Local Capital for Social Purposes’. Financed by  ESF, the programme gives small grants of up to 10.000 to local projects which  foster social activation. The programme acts in areas that cannot be reached by  the central ESF programme.  The Job Forum unit in Bergsjon in Sweden. All individuals seeking social  assistance and who is able to work h as to follow a programme of agreed job  training, education etc with the Job Forum. Social assistance payments are  conditional on fulfilling the agreement which individuals make with the Job Forum.  The Mile project has received funding from ERDF within the URBACT Programme.  
II.  Intercultural dialogue and access of migrants and ethnic  minorities to education, health and housing in the European  Union  
1. Background.
  Intercultural dialogue and participation are two interlinked concep ts, which overlap  constantly. The study prepared for the European Commission by the European Institute for  Comparative Cultural Research (ERICarts) on National Approaches to Intercultural Dialogue  in Europe demonstrates that effective promotion of different cultures in the local environment  enhances directly the participation of migrants and ethnic minorities in the social and political  life and vice versa. Intercultural dialogue can only take place in an environment where a person is guaranteed safety and dignity, equality of opportunity and participation, where  different views can be voiced openly without fear, where there are shared spaces for  exchanges between different cultures to take place. From this point of view, there are indeed several EU directives and national legal frameworks outlining basic human, civic, economic  and social rights, upon which intercultural dialogue depends. Specific articles of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights (2000) are of particular importance  to intercultural dialogue by addressing: equality (e.g. non -discrimination and cultural,  religious and linguistic diversity); freedoms (e.g. freedom of expression, of thought,  conscience and religion); and citizens’ rights (e.g. of movement and residence, to vote).  Accompanying the EU Charter are several directives, which address equality, two of which  include: the Racial Equality Directive (2000) , and the Employment Equality Directive  (2000) . These principles and rights are reaffirmed in the Commission's Social Agenda (2005), Culture Agenda (2007) as well as in the December 2007 EU Treaty of Lisbon. Integration policies and measures are high on the European Agenda since the Tampere  Council (1999), but migrants’ participation in the decision making process and intercultural  dialogue were not regulated nor promoted in any particular way until the few last years on the The Mile project has received funding from ERDF within the URBACT Programme. European level. The new era of globalisation, of continuous EU enlargement and high  mobility of EU and non -EU citizens has pushed the European Commission to consider  Intercultural Dialogue as an efficient tool contributing to the effective governance of cultural  diversity within European Societies. In December 2006, the European parliament and the council of the European Union adopted  the decision that the year 20 08 shall be designated as the ‘European Year of Intercultural  Dialogue’ to contribute to giving expression and a high profile to a sustained process of  intercultural dialogue which will continue beyond that year. It states that intercultural dialogue  contributes, among others, to respecting and promoting cultural diversity in Europe, to  improving co -existence and encouraging active citizenship and to ensuring equal  opportunities and non -discrimination within the EU 6 .  Some of the objectives of the year of Intercultural dialogue relevant to this project:   Work to identify, share and give a visible European recognition to best practices in  promoting intercultural dialogue throughout the EU, especially among young people  and children, Foster the role of education as an important medium for teaching about diversity,  increase the understanding of other cultures and developing skills and best social  practices, and highlight the central role of the media in promoting the principle of  equality and mutual understanding,  Contribute to exploring new approaches to intercultural dialogue involving  cooperation between a wide range of stakeholders from different sectors. In terms of measures and financial instruments, Intercultural dialogue became a priority in  several parts of the EU’s Education and Culture programmes since 2007, such as Lifelong  Learning, Culture and Europe for Citizens programmes. It is also part of Youth in Action programme. These programmes have provided support for projects promoting intercultural  dialogue in preparation of the 2008 European Year of Intercultural Dialogue.

"My Generation.
MY GENERATION is about promoting the potential of the young in cities.
MY GENERATION does this by:
 
Developing new insights into the youth lifestyles and aspirations of the young.
Fostering genuine youth involvement throughout the project. 
Providing positive activity and career alternatives. 
Promoting boundary crossing collaboration of various actors and services, particularly local communities, education, business and public officials. 
Developing and disseminating good practices of engagement and contact. 
Underpinning the above with effective and relevant local action plans and strategies. 
The young themselves are at the core, and the contacts to, and between local communities, education and employment will provide opportunities and resources for positive solutions.

In Europe, policies that promote young people are too fragmented and short-lasting, and they also suffer from being unilaterally directed towards a single target when the diversity of the challenges calls for integrated measures. For more than two and a half years, the twelve partner cities in the URBACT project My Generation worked to identify effective local policies in three areas: giving disadvantaged young people more access to social services already in place in cities; creating bridges between training, education and the business world; and improving coordination among the various players and including young people in the decision-making process.
Main Results.
One major conclusion: Young people must be involved in formalising the actions and policies that concern them. 
Although the partner cities in the My Generation project are facing different challenges, they all arrived at the conclusion that young people must become real co-creators of the solutions that are implemented. This lesson underlies all the other conclusions and implies changing usual ways of thinking.
My Generation partners applied this principle through a number of actions: 
By opening up new prospects for young peoples’ aspirations and for their lifestyles.
By promoting their involvement in all steps of the project.
By opening up access to positive activities, career alternatives and by enabling them to meet other young people who have overcome similar issues.
By promoting cross-collaboration among the various players and services, particularly associations, education, businesses and public service.
By developing and disseminating good practices in the areas of commitment and partnership.
By creating tools that support the above measures.
By basing these measures and tools on local action plans and on effective and adequate strategies.

 Recommendations for developing policies and activities that promote the positive potential of young people:
Make young people the co-creators of the projects:
For My Generation, the partner cities surrounded themselves with young people at every stage of their project. At every moment and for all their activities, the cities asked the following questions: How committed are the young people? How can this be improved? In order to promote contact and create conditions for co-creation, it was necessary to rethink the way the work sessions were being led, as well as the activities and communication tools, the way of making them active, creative, amusing, and of highlighting all the senses.
Building an approach based on young people as resources:
Young people are often perceived as a “problem”. Yet they are a key resource in co-creating projects. During My Generation, it proved very fruitful to have capitalised on the skills they have acquired informally. Associations, education and the business world should get organised to make better use of the skills acquired in everyday life, be they music, dance, sports, computers, multimedia, or others.
A multi-player approach for better partnerships:
Nobody can resolve such complex societal challenges alone. The entire My Generation project is based on building partnerships among players that work in the field promoting the cause of young people. All the work meetings included young people, professionals, inhabitants, entrepreneurs and elected officials.
A multi-method approach:
Young people are rather closed to traditional communication methods and it is indispensable to use other media (action, dialogue, movement, dance, music, images, video). Throughout the My Generation project, the cities emphasised real stories, ambassadors and mediators, champions and models the young people could use as role models.
Facilitate an active transition:
It is not enough to convince young people that they can change their life, one also needs to offer them the possibility to do so and to support them. It is easy to break the virtuous circle that leads from inactivity to self-confidence, and this is why it is necessary to use a ‘sponsor’ who also comes from the younger generation, or who can be identified as a role model, in order to serve as a mediator.
Develop a holistic policy based on good practices:
The policies implemented by the cities to promote young people should cover all fields of actions: young people in situations of failure, education, employment and business creation. My Generation partners developed a road map for local policy and for activities to roll out, which identifies good practices as well as phases of critical transition.
FROM EDUCATION TO EMPLOYMENT (the E and E theme); TRANSITION TO WORKING LIFE
Readers of this report will, I hope, be able to explore both the MY GENERATION mind set and methodological aspects as well as some of the good, concrete examples that have been developed by the participating cities in order to animate schools and to strengthen connections between schools and the rest of the community, including business/workplaces. The main idea is to support cities to establish a collaborative process to better support young people’s transition from school to work. 

Introduction
Back in 2009 the European Parliament stated that unemployment among young people was one of the EU’s major challenges and most serious problems. One year later (September 2010) 5.2 million EU-citizens under the age of 25 were unemployed – an increase of 1.3 million young people compared with the situation before the start of the economic crisis. In February 2011 policymakers in Brussels warned of a “lost generation” of young workers, highlighting the situation as “the biggest employment issue in Europe right now”.  
Compared to the overall unemployment statistics, young Europeans have been hit disproportionately by the recession. This is a fact in all member states, even if there are big differences between countries. In Spain, the youth unemployment rate is 40 %, while the number in Germany, Austria and the Netherlands stops at 10 %. Nevertheless widespread youth unemployment could be considered a ticking bomb, affecting both the possibilities and aspirations of the young, but also adding a lot of pressure to welfare systems, community budgets and challenges for future development, future innovation, management and leadership.  
But just blaming the present crisis is not enough to explain young people’s problems in entering the job market. The problem is far more complex than that. It is true though that a recession generally hits young people’s job opportunities harder than the average, but there are also a number of other factors at work. Some examples are: schools do not provide the young with the necessary skills requested by employers/labour market ; a large number of school drop outs leaves many young with a lack of basic skills and a reluctant approach towards schools and studies ; young people’s lack of integration in society, finding themselves objectified, problematized, unused ; the continued belief in formal education as the only platform for real knowledge ; the lack of coherent, sustainable and cross-sectorial approaches emerging from a holistic point of view, i.e. a “chain of performance” set up between several policy areas such as those of education, the labour market, social and social welfare, aimed at supporting the young in a positive transition process.
It is also important to remember that the transition process in most countries is becoming longer. As an example, in Sweden research shows that the school-to-work (STW)-period has increased with seven years in the last two decades. It is also true that today’s transition period has become a rather complex process, often involving the interaction of different kinds of policies: those of education, the labour market, social and social welfare, immigration services etc. If we consider the transition to work as a key stage in laying the basis for life long learning and work throughout life, then training and education for one thing should aim at presenting youth with diverse pathways. However, schools often fail to motivate youth, leaving them puzzled with how to benefit from different opportunities. This is especially vital to those young people at greatest risk of not being able to enter the labour market, but also for those who have chosen to follow an academic education pathway, this must be taking seriously into account. In addition, a major challenge to schools of today is to be able to connect to the outside world - to develop and explore both learning in itself and the possibilities available for every young student. 
Already in the early 80’s analysts predicted that 1/3rd of the young born in 1982 would have trouble finding a job; due to the continued development of technology and the future innovations they predicted that the number of jobs needed to produce goods would be reduced in a dramatic way. In retrospect, we now know that the scenario on one hand seems to be spot on; lots and lots of jobs have disappeared within industry and manufacturing while on the other hand, we now experience a massive growth in services, to some extent reducing the gap, offering new job opportunities and possibilities. Thus, there have been signs and alerts along the way for us all to react against. The My Generation story could be used as a learning lesson, or rather, a wakeup call, to challenge societies and cities to be a bit more proactive than reactive. We have to find better ways to adapt to changes – and first and foremost we have to establish tools that will allow us to plan for change rather than to react to consequences. Learning from the past should help us become better prepared to tackle whatever future challenges, not only youth unemployment or the transition from school to working life but all issues, both foreseen and unforeseen, coming our way. 
To the MY GENERATION cities that stressed the education and employment theme as their primary focus (Warsaw, Tirgu-Mures, Valencia, Patras, and to a great extent, also Gothenburg and Rotterdam), the project has added valuable, innovative food for thought regarding the school to work transition. To the rest of the cities, prioritising the Outreach and/or the Coordination theme, taking part also in the E and E theme must have been a process of great interest. After all, the three themes are links in a positive transition chain; and as such, links that are very closely connected.
My Generation – setting the scene. 
Following the MY GENERATION basic ideas about co creation, holistic approaches and avoiding target group thinking - causing objectification and an “us and them” situation - has proven to be very fruitful in developing the E and E theme. As the participating cities by nature have differing experiences, needs, policies and possibilities, approving the co-creative and open-minded atmosphere has become a natural way to “live” social innovation and to connect different topics to each other. By doing it this way the network, with help from everyone participating, has been able to fill in the gaps in the “performance chain” regarding the transition support structure of every city. In reality, this has meant that cities with an initial lower interest in the E and E theme or with specific and addressed needs within the theme have been able to add both good examples from an operative as well as examples on a more strategic level to their Local Action Plan agenda and thus, to their local work. 
To better visualise the MG concept both to the MG network and to external actors we have, together with the young, developed the CITYSCAPE; a graphic “roadmap” covering the different aspects of young people’s transition from school to work. This transformative experience sees them move from puzzlement, disaffection and exclusion to the fulfilment of their potential and active contribution as citizens. The CITYSCAPE is also a model for displaying and imagining the different areas and services that the MG network has discovered. It covers the Outreach, E and E and Coordination themes, connecting them in a logical, yet challenging way. By adapting the CITYSCAPE to future city planning, there are opportunities for every city; possibilities to better understand the situation of young people today and thus, to establish holistic structures to better support a positive transition process.
When looking specifically at the E and E theme and what has emerged from the collaborative work between cities in the MG network, the following areas have proven to be of great interest:
Transformation of schools; schools closing the gap to community actors and business ;
The aspects and importance of recognition of non formal/informal learning ;
Innovative, individualised and tailor made guidance and counselling services ;
The support of young entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial environments ;
The above areas have been explored bit by bit, some cities taking the lead, others following. At the first E and E workshop in Gothenburg, the Swedish hosts brought forward the aspects of non-formal/informal learning and entrepreneurship. There were mind blowing presentations on Youth entrepreneurship programmes in Swedish schools, there was study visits at creative business incubators and there were good examples from partner cities of programmes working with young people, marginalised by language, culture or social reasons, in how to build trust and connections that eventually could replace isolation with a more inclusive transition process. Nevertheless, the workshop was a fundamental icebreaker in exploring the complex inner life of the transition process, being not only related to schools but also to complimentary areas such as guidance, non-/informal skills, job creation, entrepreneurship and business support mechanisms – in a context of co-creation and the need for a holistic approach. 
The second thematic workshop in Valencia really decided to emphasize the entrepreneurial aspect as its main focus. Participating cities brought good examples of cooperation between schools and business and of entrepreneurial training, examples that really had a positive impact on opportunities for the young. Other examples supporting the entrepreneurial spirit took its starting point from the insight that an increasing number of young people start their own business without the support from agencies like the Chamber of Commerce. There was also the sparkling acquaintance with Hi5, a spectacular initiative building on the driving forces, talents and non-formal skills of the young in combination with the emerging growth of music, creative business and events.
Other examples in line with the four key areas above have reached good practice status throughout the life cycle of the project; one, focusing on the non-formal knowledge aspect, is the C-stick – both a gadget (USB device) and a web based learning tool that, when connected, helps young people both to collect, develop and display their various skills and competences. The C-stick system also provides individual coaching and guidance to explore and visualise alternative pathways and opportunities for the young.
Following the MG legacy that learning is not only a formal thing, a Youth Pass was invented where the young participating in the project could have their experiences and new knowledge recognised and signed off by managers from their respective city. This way the project in itself has worked as a platform for innovative traineeships, offering important skills and tools that could be transformed into highly requested knowledge in any business or workplace! 

Final reflections
There is no doubt that the work and the results carried out by the MG network cities present a genuine melting pot of innovative as well as less innovative - but still interesting - examples of links in a chain of performance to support a transition period that has become both longer and more complex than ever before. The cities’ examples provide good, practical knowledge in how to motivate schools to become more attractive and demand led, how dropouts could be motivated to get back into educational activities – and, even better, how the dropout syndrome could be decreased. There are examples of multi stakeholder incentives aiming at creating holistic support structures, including innovative ways of coaching and counselling, to promote positive transition and to reduce youth unemployment. And there are very good examples of how the true potential of the young could be transformed into self-employment, new companies and projects. There is a framework to learn from concerning the important issue of informal/non formal learning, taking into account the many learning opportunities and arenas beside the traditional formal ones and the consequences and opportunities this brings, both to the young themselves and to employers as well as to the society as a whole. Any city should, just by picking from the examples in this report, get great help in modelling their own transition support system. So far so good. 
Nevertheless, one has to be realistic about the possibilities to deliver transformative change in school systems and curricula, in attitudes and organisations. Along with a strong vision, one has to go back to, and jointly accept, the MG legacy and the basic principles of the MG work; to promote the positive potential of the young generation in the cities – with the young and for the young, as well as to promote seamless transitions and services that could overcome the breakdowns in growing up towards positive self-reliance. In the MG case, these key messages are very well taken into account in the Final report made by the city of Tirgu- Mures:
“… the educational community has to regenerate its system, by introducing new profiles in its curricula, correlated to local economic tendencies, by offering trainings in real business environments (on voluntary basis, too), by cooperating with companies in offering on demand skilled young human resource, by focusing on identifying and stimulating the competencies and abilities of each individual for active participation within society, by informing and counselling its students.
The business community has its share, too. First of all it has to change the way of thinking, by offering jobs to the young human resources, opportunities to demonstrate their potential and creativity and has to cooperate with the educational community on a win-win base.  Moreover, they could also encourage young people to become entrepreneurs. 
On the other hand, the Employment Agency has the role of a mediator in between these two communities: Education and Business. It is within his responsibility that supply and demand on the job market meet. And for this a good database is needed as well as advantageous employment policies on both sides that would facilitate companies to employ young people. 
Non-governmental organisations could also participate to this process of integrating young labour force into local economy, by preparing, qualifying the young for specific jobs.
Young people have to make their voice heard and express their needs, while they have to develop also their informal knowledge besides getting skilled. 
In conclusion, the Office for Counselling and Orientation in Career would represent the centre with the role of combining the responsibilities of each involved community on a “win-win base”, so that the final beneficiary would become the local community.

My Generation at Work Baseline: In search of new attitudes, skills and collaboration to create work for the young generations in cities
1. A gap opening between young people and the changing
world of work
Today’s news is filled with messages of crisis and change in the global markets and the world
of work. It is a confusing, precarious and scary world for the young generation thinking about
careers, skills and jobs. At the same time Europe is aging; post-war generations are being
pensioned, but the emerging opportunities and the new world of work is not the same as for
them.
The crisis facing Europe since 2008 has disproportionately affected young people. Across Europe,
youth unemployment rates have rocketed in recent years. Within the EU 27, and within
the partnership of My Generation at Work, there are wide variations both between and within
Member States ranging from under 10% to parts of Spain with a staggering 50%.
Finding and sustaining a job is profoundly different today and tomorrow from the past decades,
and young people are exposed to sudden changes, precarious employment and careers,
and a need for continual re-adaption. Back in the day, most young people finished school and
went straight into work, and stayed there. In cities, there were plenty of opportunities and a
wide variety of threshold entry-level jobs. If you were fortunate enough to have attended university
or college, your prospects were even better, and you could often pick and choose your
preferred professional career path.
That’s all changed now, and the transition into employment has become longer and, for many
young people, less direct, also for the better educated. Moving straight from education into
employment – particularly permanent stable employment – is becoming less typical for young
people. Instead, their initial experience of the workplace is less predictable, often fragmented
and prolonged.
At the same time attitudes and behaviours of young people have changed, reflecting the
changes in society, families, work and the rising awareness of global threats and limits of traditional
growth. Young people are more aware and connected – and at the same time often
inadequately empowered to deal with the new challenges.
The world of work has also changed profoundly in ways that affect everybody, not only those
who have traditionally been in a weaker position – young people, women, low educated, immigrants,
disabled people. Today even the strong can stumble. Everybody is trying to find ways
of navigating through the turbulent waters of change.
In fact there is a gap between the ‘ways of being in the world’ of young people and the changing
world of work. On the one hand there are the ‘X, Y and Z’ generations – full of energy and
creativity and with new ways of connecting and learning, proficient in the digital world and
rising environmental values - but often with fragmentary educational and working careers,
frustration with their aspirations being blocked, and disillusionment with the way the people in
power are handling the challenges.

On the other hand the work of is rapidly changing. The technology-societal model based on
mass-production, cheap energy, raw materials and labour is receding, albeit in a contradictory
way, and happening at different pace in different parts of the world, and also within individual
countries. New networking and decentralised production models, based on rising environmental
awareness and values, and ICT are on the rise. (Gratton 2011).
At the moment we are at a contradictory crossroads, a change period, where the actions,
structures and attitudes – in working life, safety nets, organisations, career and employment
models, education and management are still often burdened by the ‘mass-society’ model, and
are often poorly geared to the emerging new. These contradictions are felt particularly hard by
young people, who have not yet been able to establish themselves, and to enjoy the safety
nets developed in the industrial era. (Boyer 2004, Freeman and Louca 2001, Perez 2004).
The changes also open up new possibilities, challenge old ways of building skills, finding employment
and creating jobs. Finding employment is no longer just a linear process of basic
education – vocational education – looking for a ready job – being employed (and staying
there) – as it was at the heyday of the mass-production society.
The young people are caught in the middle – aware that the society and the world of work has
changed, but often left without adequate possibilities to acquire skills and behaviours to deal
with the new situations. Their ‘being in the world’ is new, but the ways of finding employment
and creating work are often traditional. In education possibilities of using new ways of learning
and digi-learning, connections to the world of work, work practice and counselling are often
inadequate and rigid. Searching for work through official channels is often traditional and inefficient.
There is inadequate awareness of other possibilities than traditional salaried work, and
even salaried work has changed into a multi-faceted world of flexiwork, telework and hybrid
arrangements of salaried and self-employment. There is still a stiff divide between salaried and
entrepreneurial work –in terms of attitudes, contractual arrangements and safety-nets. The
recruitment channels of the business world do not reach the young generations in efficient
ways. There is a gap between the world of the young people and the needs of the world of
work.

2. Lessons from My Generation project in bridging the gap.
My Generation at Work had a predecessor, My Generation, an URBACT project run from 2009
to 2011. It was about promoting the potential of young people in cities by developing insights
into the lifestyles and aspirations of the young people, fostering their genuine involvement
throughout the project, providing positive activity and career alternatives, and promoting collaboration
of local communities, education, public officials and the business community.
In My Generation, it was recognized, that young people were left in a passive role, treated not
as a vital resource, but as a problem to be ‘treated’. In fact, My Generation identified three
problems plaguing projects and policies in Europe: target-group thinking, fragmentation of
action and low sustainability of results.
My Generation set out to do things differently. The most important point was to have the
young as genuine co-creators all along the way, and not as a ‘target group’. It also meant new ways of engaging with the young. A key lesson was to transform the ecology of engagement
with people – it had to be creative, lively and use all the senses through the possibilities of
multi-media. Also dissemination of results had to be changed. It meant that the products
coming out of the project had to be ‘hybrid’: not only analysis and written text, but pictures,
stories and videos to liven and illustrate new possibilities and communicate better to the young
people.

3. Lessons from good practices to create social innovations in cities.
Youth unemployment is an acute problem, but My Generation at Work takes a mid-to-longterm
approach towards contributing towards solutions to enhance youth employment. Small
projects with very limited resources, like MGatWork in the cities cannot make a difference
against the global downturn in terms of directly providing jobs for young people. But it can
make a difference by identifying and developing good practices, and catalysing and mobilising
multi-stakeholder cooperation, where with mid-to-long-term efforts the cities can put in place
good practices against the city landscape, the ‘cityscape’ of promoting the employability and
job creation of young people.
My Generation at Work is about promoting the employability of young people in the changing
labour market and the future of work. Even more at that, My Generation at Work has a special
focus on enterprising attitudes and skills of young people, as one of the keys to close the gap
between the changing world of being of the young people and the changing world of work. In
this MGatWork set out to identify, develop and embed good practices, social innovations and
policies, so that cities can enrich their youth policy ‘cityscape’ in the coming years and decade.
In this mid-to-long term effort it is important to listen to some lessons on good practices in
cities and elsewhere.
Lesson 1: We need a co-creation approach
There is a paradox that at the same time that society has reached a mature level, it is facing
severe challenges in terms of credibility and sustainability from a citizen’s point of view, economically
and politically. The main response and alternative is now not about expanding the
welfare society any more (as it was in the industrial era), but how to become more effective in
responding to citizen’s needs and also to rely more on the activity of the citizens themselves.
There is a red thread, a “DNA-strand” running through the entire innovation debate today,
including social innovation, concerning the core of developing good practices. It is new ways of
enabling real citizen involvement, participation and co-creation in all activities – ranging from
strengthening democratic institutions and making economies stronger to re-inventing public
services and partnerships, and combatting social exclusion.
In the innovation debate the basic model has so far been co-creation with a ‘triple helix’ – cocreation
between science, public sector and business. This model is now, in various ways, including
a ‘fourth strand’, real and deeper customer and citizen involvement, into the process at
all stages – ideas, planning, piloting, developing and executing. This has also been called user
participation, where the participation can happen at different degrees – design for the user,
with the user and by the user. ‘Living labs’, incubators of new connections for co-creation, under
different names and guises, are popping up everywhere. This re-invention is taking place
also in cities and within the public sector.
The whole debate about good practice is about re-inventing and repositioning citizen and customer
activity towards the system/ the services/ the professionals. All good practices emphasise
the importance of identifying the real societal and individual needs in a sensitive way, and
to validate the practices against the needs and the context. In good practice citizens and customers
are no longer just objects of activity, or targets of “ready-made” products, but more
and more co-creators of the service or product.
So taking a cue from the global innovation debate, the key message for the re-invention for
strategies, policies and practices in cities is developing good practices for co-creation - new
ways of working with all stakeholders – and in the instance of My generation at Work, in particular
with the young people themselves. The key word here is co-creation, because no stakeholder
alone can secure better solutions, not the citizen, user, public official, professional or
anybody else.

Lesson 2: We need new interfaces in the front line of services.
The importance of the quality of front line service is strongly emphasised in all of the good
practice debates. The “acid test” of city good practice is front line service, the contact with the
customer, the citizen. Without good contact, without rapport, there is no good practice.
The old service model emphasised, that the “official knows better” than the citizen. The professional
was equipped to know “what”, and to know “how” and then find a solution. Activation
or employment plans were not made, co-created, with the customer, but for the customer –
resulting in poor commitment and poor results. The new one is where the ‘what and how’ has
become co-creation, “knowing from within” the good contact with the customer.
This has meant also, that the “interface”, the way in which we communicate with the citizens
need re-inventing and co-creation. This is particularly true with the young people – and all
customers who don’t represent the mainstream, or the cultures in power. Many of the old ways
of service delivery simply don’t work.
Methods using multiple and alternative channels of communication (narratives, stories, metaphors,
social media) are used more and more. The services must be taken to the communities,
where the young people hang out. And we need convincing, ‘street savvy’ young ambassadors
to establish rapport and contact with the young people.
Key lesson for My Generation at Work: The input, skills and creativeness of young people is
indispensable to re-invent the interfaces in the front-line of services, and at the same time
offers possibilities for the young people to develop skills and attitudes they need in the labour
market.


Lesson 3: We need real teamwork and peer learning
The further the development of expertise has evolved, the more the theme of cooperation
across different professions and disciplines, and a holistic grasp of matters has been on the
rise. The paradox here is that the more we attain knowledge through specialization, the more
there is a need for grasping the whole. We are constantly confronted by fragmenting of action.
Nobody works completely alone, and in all organisational, management and good practice debates,
the question of the quality of teamwork is high on the agenda. Peer learning and support
is the hinge of good practice here. It offers the individual, and the team effective ways to
learn, assimilate and interpret the complex influences and impressions from around (from
partners, other teams, management).
Key lesson for My Generation at Work: Peer learning offers young people effective ways of acquiring
new contacts, skills and attitudes, so opportunities for young people to learn and act in
teams should be arranged and encouraged by the cities.

Lesson 4: We need brokers and ‘spaces’ for border-crossing and partnerships
The divisions, created in the expansion of services and organisations in the post-war build up
of societies, corresponds poorly to the needs of citizens and communities today. The problems
and challenges in the peoples’ lives defy the rigid boundaries between education, social work,
housing, health, culture, employment services and business creation.
Also, there is more and more a shift to outsourcing, subcontracting and principal-agent structures,
which means that the customer service chains and structures become even more complicated,
extended and time-consuming. More often than not, responsibilities become unclear,
and the red thread is lost. All this entails a lot of border crossing, working on borders and solving
“turf battles”, all strong themes in the good practice debate.
In fact border crossing becomes more important than drawing borders. The most interesting
things often happen “on borders”, either across internal or internal-external borders. For border
crossing, spanning gaps and to promote cooperation we need brokers. Brokers come in
different guises, and they are needed on all levels of activities, and between levels: Good results
have been achieved with personal coaches, case-managers, networkers and network coordinators.
There is a whole debate going on the need to have ‘tertius iungens’, “a third who connects”, in order to span gaps, and gain good cooperation and results. Being a good broker
calls for special skills and experience, and it is fact a set of rising new professions.
For border crossing in networks also ‘spaces’ for multi-stakeholder meeting, dialogue and collaboration
are needed. These range from community events to fairs, workshops and conferences.
How to use those events effectively to promote real dialogue and co-creation has become
a key challenge, and cities can here play a vital enabling and catalysing role.
Key lesson for My Generation at Work: Young people can be vital and creative brokers in reinventing
contact with different stakeholders, first and foremost with the young people themselves,
and at the same time brokering can offer and opportunity to young people to acquire
useful skills and attitudes towards the labour market.

Lesson 5: We need enabling and catalysing management and governance
The more front line service and their networks move into a multi-vocal, multi-actor, negotiating,
dialogical and networking mode and practice, the more all levels of management, and
governance are challenged and forced to adopt new methods. Old “line management”, or “silomanagement”,
reflecting the Industrial Society, is a thing of the past, and in comes management
by learning, by results, by negotiation, by networking. ‘Management 2.0’ becomes “enabling”
and ‘catalysing’. You cannot “manage” learning, or good practice in traditional ways. You
can empower, facilitate, enable, catalyse and resource it.
A very strong theme in the good practice debate is what is happening to management, and a
concern that management is, in relative terms, lagging behind the “paradigm change” of practice
in the front line.
As a response to these pressures, management is being re-invented. To address the dialogical
challenges, enabling management, caring management, coaching management, experimenting
management is put in place. To address the complex networks arising, and the proliferation of
projects, management which is adept in building multi-stakeholder ‘spaces’ ‘ forums, events,
workshops, ‘Living Labs - is needed. In order to address the whole complexity of management,
new holistic approaches, social auditing, evaluation and estimating Social Return of Investment
are put in place.
Key lesson for My Generation at Work: Young people can be vital and creative partners in
providing management and governance with fresh ideas, skills and input, to close the gap that
now has opened between the changes in front-line services and out-dated modes of management.
By participating in this transformation, young people can acquire useful skills and attitudes
for the labour market.

Lesson 6: We need hybrid learning environments and products
There is a need to tap into the rapidly developing new world of communication and learning,
and create a ‘hybrid’ face-to-face and digital environment to maximise rapid, serendipitous and
open learning.
There are basically three kinds of ways of using new ways of communication and learning environments
with urban young people in their everyday media activity, and the possibilities of adults and public agents supporting this: Public online networks, friendship driven networks
and interest driven networks.
Key lesson for My Generation at Work: Young people, being of the ‘digital and gaming generations’
are a vital and creative partner in transforming education, curriculums, learning models,
brokerage, and at the same time, participating in these transformations offers young people
endless possibilities to acquire and develop their skills and establish themselves in the labour market.

Lesson 7: We need a powerful concept of learning.
The changing world and labour market calls for powerful concepts and practices in learning –
not only for the young people, but also for the projects and programmes promoting the learning
of young people, or other stakeholders.
In My Generation the concepts of the trailblazing work of Ijikuro Nonaka and his colleagues,
together with other seminal work, like Etienne Wenger and Bjorn Gustavsen, were used as
inspirational sources for designing good learning in the My Generation workshops.
It was particularly important in My Generation, the predecessor of My Generation at Work, that
the workshops and engagement was designed so that particularly young people could relate to
the process well, as well as other stakeholders. This meant that particular attention was paid to establishing good contact in terms of socialising, and enriching the ways of expressing and
articulating oneself. Here the work of Nonaka was the key source of inspiration.
A key concept in Nonaka’s model is ”learning space”, or ”ba”, in Japanese. This ‘space’ is at
the same time physical and mental and emotional, and can be also virtual and a hybrid space
combining face-to-face and virtual communication.. It is a “platform of knowledge”, a shared
context, where knowledge is shared, created and utilized. A typical example would be a team
with a task, which shares certain face-to-face meeting places backed up with virtual communication,
and entering, in their task, “a stream of meaning” (Bohm 1996). In other words, the
“ba” provides the energy, time and space to perform the knowledge conversions, and the task
for knowledge management is to enable the emergence of such “ba’s”.
In Nonakas learning concept, the process of learning revolves through four different stages,
which all call for a different ‘space’: Socialisation > Externalisation > Connection > Internalisation,
constituting what is called the SECI-process.

Key lesson for My Generation at Work: We need to continue the good experiences of My Generation
of using the ‘spaces’ concept and process - socialising, articulating, connecting and
doing-it-yourself in My Generation at Work. This means continuing to co-create the events as
good learning spaces, where young people can thrive as partners. It also means putting in
place an experimental, do-it-yourself piloting dynamic into the Partner city projects. And finally
it means that also the products, the way the social innovations are presented, need to be enriched
so that they communicate well in terms of learning.

Lesson 8: We need to understand good practice and social innovation as ‘locally embedded
practice’
There is general agreement in the good practice debate, that at the end of the day, practice is
always local and contextual, locally “embedded”, and in this sense there is no general of good
practice in promoting employment, or any other topic.
But there are plenty of examples of practices, policies and approaches that do work, and make
a difference.
To use a metaphor, all good songs consist of the same chords and notes, but in unique combinations.
There is no end for creativity in creating new songs from those same chords and
notes. And what is more, those chords and notes are only the ‘script’ of good music. A living
band is needed to breathe life into it, and perform it – for and with audiences.
Much in the same way the essence of good practice is not in separate tools, methods or concepts,
but rather in the unique combination of them, fit for purpose and circumstances, and
first and foremost, in the activity of teams, ‘communities of practice’ (Wenger 1998) to make
them work.
Any good idea of promoting employment needs to be fitted in to the local circumstances, and it
can only be done by “communities of practice”, the local ‘bands’. Even the best and most ingenious
of individual practices is always embedded in a community of practice, and can only
be sustained in it. In this sense the practices are not “components” or commodities, but rather
manifestations of a “community whole”(Senge 1990), very much like the chords, notes and
bands do not exist in a vacuum, but constitute a living network.
In this sense it could be useful to think of practice always being a “360-degree” practice,
meaning that every practice is embedded in a 360-degree context: there is a citizen and customer
dimension, a horizontal networking and partnership dimension and a vertical management
and governance dimension in every practice. In order for a practice to be good, and sustainable,
it needs to be successfully ‘embedded’ in the 360-degree context, so that its able to
establish a sufficiently good contact to customers, horizontal partners, management and decision
making.
In fact, the Local Support Group approach, applied in URBACT and My Generation at Work, is a
360-degree approach in the sense that a good composition of the LSG has representation of
the customer/ citizen (in the instance of MGatWork it is the young people, horizontal partners
(in MGatWork educators, NGOs, business community) and management and decision making
(managers), sometimes politicians, but more often indirectly, in a supportive role.
The LSG is best understood as a ‘microcosm’, representing in an important way the core of
people, who are needed to embed and sustain the social innovations coming out of the project.
The LSG directs the experiments made in the different topics identified in MGatWork, and then
indicates in the Local Action Plan, how the work can be carried on further, scaled up and sustained.

What is more, by understanding good practice as ’360-degree’ good practice, we can at times
enhance mutual learning across contexts by using 360-degree teams in the learning process,
by inviting representatives of citizens, front-line services, horizontal partners, management
and decision making to our learning events. The 360-degree team is a ‘microcosm’ of the
learning organisation, and it means that instead of bringing separate individuals to the learning
event, small groups, ‘microcosms’, which represent some of the vertical and horizontal actors
of the practice, come and participate. Embedding the practice in the ‘360’ degree context
starts already in the dialogue event. This makes it easier to put the practice in context, and
also start to work on it, when returning home.
In the URBACT and MGatWork context this means, that it is easier to understand the social
innovations of another city, when we understand how the practice operates in a 360-degree
context, i.e. what is the customer contact, the horizontal partnership and the role of management,
governance and resourcing.
Key lesson for My Generation at Work: The social innovations, good practices and service
products need to be understood, described and embedded in a 360-degree context, which is
also the ‘microcosm’ approach of the Local Support Groups, and needs to be treated also in the
Local Action Plans, so that the context of sustaining the practice can be more readily understood.
Participating in such a 360-degree approach gives the young people also a learning opportunity
about how society and working-life function, and is thus fruitful for developing their
skills and attitudes towards the labour market.

Synthesis: Bridging the gap - My Generation at Work in search of new attitudes, skills and collaboration to create
work for the young generations.
1. The what: Enterprising skills and attitudes in bridging the gap
Youth unemployment is an acute problem, but My Generation at Work takes a mid-to-longterm
approach towards contributing towards solutions to enhance youth employment. Small
projects with very limited resources, like MGatWork in the cities cannot make a difference
against the global downturn in terms of providing jobs for young people. But it can make a
difference by catalysing multi-stakeholder cooperation, where with mid-to-long-term efforts
the cities can put in place good practices against the city landscape, the ‘cityscape’ of promoting
the employability and job creation of young people.
My Generation at Work is about promoting the employability of young people in the changing
labour market and the future of work. Even more at that, My Generation at Work has a special
focus on enterprising attitudes and skills of young people, as one of the keys to close the gap
between the changing world of being of the young people and the changing world of work. In
this MGatWork set out to identify, develop and embed good practices, social innovations and
policies, so that cities can enrich their youth policy ‘cityscape’ in the coming years and decade.
With the concept of enterprising attitudes and skills My Generation at Work wants to capture
the new thinking and acting needed in the changing times towards the labour market. In short
the changes call for an approach where work and jobs are more self-created and carved out,
than searched for, as something waiting out there. There is a whole palette of options to be
used in a flexible way – different modes of salaried employment, hybrid combinations of salaried
and self-employment, cooperatives, social enterprises, self-employment, teamentrepreneurship
and launching business. All opportunities for building skills and networks,
social capital and connections should be used. As a working hypothesis My Generation at Work
assumes, that weather you are aiming at a salaried or a self-employment career, proactive
enterprising skills and attitudes are what the present and future working life needs.
Job-finding and job-creating actions need to be adjusted and re-adjusted, opportunities need
to be grabbed – instead of ‘waiting for employment’ and looking for some stable jobs and careers.
Also the ways of connecting and learning and creating skills has profoundly changed –
and education needs to be transformed to meet this challenge. Today it is a ‘hybrid world’: A
whirlwind of informal and formal learning, connecting face-to-face and in the digital world. It
is a combination of planned action, surprises and even chaos. It is more like an adventure and
a discovery journey, than the traditional ‘career path’. Overall, it is about enriching your connections
and grabbing opportunities.
This is what MY Generation at Work has set out to explore and discover together with the
young generations of cities in Europe. In many ways this is unchartered territory, and the
journey remains precarious with the uncertainties of the world economy. Nevertheless, also a
wealth of good and new practices exist. The challenge is to identify them, co-create new, and
find ways how cities can facilitate, catalyse and enable this process, and connect disparate
activities into better wholes.

2. The how: Cross-cutting, co-creating and brokering.
It is fine to create new practice here and there, but at the end of the day, cities need a wellfunctioning
framework to enable positive agency and transitions for the young people at the
critical points in their lives. This calls for not just separate good practices, but a set of interconnected
good practices, where, again, the ‘borderlands’ – the transitions from one activity to
the other, both for the young people and to the actors and services helping them.
A strong message coming from the investigation is the need for honest and sustainable commitment
from decision-making and management to promote the youth cause in urban environments.
We need to re-vitalise our electorate and democratic mechanisms. This means turning the tide
of diminishing participation in voting of the young people, putting in place Youth Councils,
Youth Juries and all through the services promoting participation and co-creation.
Another strong message is delivering crosscutting services in and with communities. The better
working solutions are delivered with hands-on and within-communities approaches. This
calls for nothing less than re-inventing and re-structuring public services and partnerships.
Here particularly, the role of education, guidance, coaching and hands-on brokerage to prevent
drop out, and secure positive transitions stands out.
There is a whole new set of intermediary activities, professions and businesses evolving. Particularly
successful concerning young people is peer brokerage and coaching by young people.
This holds true for both providing second chance re-launches for young people dropping out of
education, and also finding work, and developing their skills. A particularly important role here
is for middle management and team leaders, who can bind together many aspects of the
‘360’degrees’ spoken about above. The skills and experience needed to act as an intermediary,
both in terms of middle management in services, and as other brokers are subtle and challenging,
and cities need to secure the sustainability of these activities and recruitment.
The business community needs to be engaged in new and more efficient ways. The young
people are the future of business, too, but education, public services and the business community
are not often working together, and certainly not often enough in co-creation with the
young people. The world of work has changed. No more permanent security of finding a job
even for the well-educated, not to speak of those with weak educational careers. No more secure
and long careers in job either. This calls for a proactive attitude and skill in carving out
your own career and jobs, often from bits and pieces, and with also surprising and lucky contacts.
Places for work practice and apprenticeships are desperately needed. Advice, coaching
and ideas from the business community are needed to transform education to become better
geared to the needs of employers.
The whirlwind of change is a very challenging environment in which to design projects. That is
why it has to combine being focussed with an ability to adapt and re-create.
The changing world of work calls for a proactive, adaptive and creative approach to work and
jobs. Understood in a profound sense, this means a kind of an ‘entrepreneurial’ attitude to
one’s career and employment. To distinguish this from traditional business creation, swe call
this an enterprising position to working life. It means an attitude, skills and action that resembles
more the attitude, skills and action of a self-employed person and an entrepreneur, instead
of a salaried employee – whether you actually aim at being an entrepreneur or not.
An enterprising position means that you are at the same time aware of the opportunities and
the precariousness of the world of work today – preparing yourself for it, connecting to people
and partners and being ready to re-adapt and grab opportunities.
This enterprising way of acting is already all around us – and not only at the traditionally
strong end of the labour market, i.e. where the well-educated and rich are setting up business.
Today we can see that the drop-outs, the disengaged, the vulnerable are showing surprising
creative skills in different walks of working life ranging from new media and arts to services
and manufacturing.
What is more, we can see these worlds – the ‘weak’ and ‘strong’ connecting to each other, and
needing each other. A dramatic example is companies (and even the army!) recruiting hackers
to jobs. Or drop out game-geeks being connected to business people and coming up with a
global success product! Meanwhile, social media organisations – Facebook, Twitter etc. – continue
to re-write the business rulebook.";"47.txt";"47"
"Net-TOPIC.
New Tools and Approaches for Managing Urban Transformation Processes in Intermediate Cities.
TOPIC PERSPECTIVE
The NeT-TOPIC project is addressed to medium sized cities that are located close to a major city and inside a metropolitan area. As a result of this location and the urban and territorial systems in which these cities are nestled, they are faced to several common problems related to their position within the whole metropolitan area. For example, the land of these cities have been used historically for the industrial sector (sectors which are now in recession/decline), for infrastructures (which split up the city) and for residential areas for the working class during the industrial period. Economic and social transformations are challenging the urban role of these cities. Urban transformation is a habitual process in the evolution of cities. It is based on a constant tension in the relations between the cities’ physical and social elements. The changes in social and economic processes always involve an almost permanent urban need to update or modernise or simply to transform cities. At this point in time and in a European context, cities, especially those in a metropolitan environment, need to adjust their urban conditions and their social characteristics to the dynamics of the urban and regional systems in which they are framed. They cannot stay in their urban and social forms. The changes in the modern economy and in the social model linked to it, as well as the regional system, which places the urban centres in a new network tension, are at the base of the process which the processes of urban transformation originate. Several transformations should be highlighted. - Cultural and social transformations resulting from the impact across society of the so-called “weightless” economy arising from the internationalisation or globalisation process are relevant aspects of this process. - The transformations of the production and distribution systems and the knowledge economies and, as well, the new uses of communication technologies. - Social transformations deriving from the changes in the role of individuals, social groups and networks, resulting from the impact of the new economic flows of globalisation. It deals with markets and industries, but mainly on the relationship between global and local. - Urban and metropolitan transformations and transformations of urban densities, in the dimension of rising above the local-municipal sphere, to enter into spheres of a new metropolitan governance and management. - Urban and metropolitan transformations and transformations of urban densities, in the dimension of rising above the local-municipal sphere, to enter into spheres of a new metropolitan governance and management. These metropolitan peripheries are faced and concerned directly to this global context and to these factors and dimensions of social, economic and urban transformation. The availability of plots of land, spaces, grounds, facilities and zones of interstitial character, obsolete or functionally out of use, which are both part of the problem and of the solution, are opportunities for urban transformation. The transformation of cities to adapt them to the new demands for uses and activities in the process of post-industrialisation and of new tertiary activities is a key process for the current new economy deriving from competitiveness, but also from the internal demands of its urban systems. In the new economic context cities should be capable of being at the centre of new transformation scenarios. These scenarios are opportunities to establish or expand private, public and mixed investment in cities, in new fields of activity. The character of urban, socio-economic promotion, but also to position the cities on the map of the new economy, is one of the bases of these key policies on urban transformation. Indeed, urban transformations are an opportunity. The processes deriving from these models of relation between the local and the global, in the urban scale of intermediate /peripheral cities in metropolitan contexts, can be further scoped, much more so if we approach the commonest spaces, zones and places of transformation. These spaces, zones and places and the commonest transformation actions arising are the following: a) Transformation of the urban structure; waterfronts and different types of urban ports; Road accesses and axes of regional connection; Renewable energies; Large-scale urban public spaces; Green zones and urban parks; and the elements of sustainable urban mobility, and especially new forms of urban transport. b) Transformation of the economic base: Obsolete or out-of-use industrial areas and recovery of contaminated industrial zones; Activities of technology centres, economic districts, mixed centres with objectives of economic modernization and/or energising; and recovery of urban or architectonic elements of the cultural Heritage and/or of social-cultural complexes for new uses. c) Transformation of residential urban fabric: Regeneration of areas and neighbourhoods which are in crisis or depressed; Activities in social or public housing as an instrument of integration and urban cohesion. d) Emblematic or architectonic transformations: Using the creation of a new symbolic building, with new urban functions, linked to or articulated in the urban transformation of large traditional areas. From a territorial point of view, European metropolitan areas are also assisting to a transformation of their peripheries. Such transformation is due to several factors: increase of the standard of living, environmental and residential quality, proximity to green areas, increase in mobility, increase in soil prices, urban planning, etc. Form an initial situation of «satellite sites» morphologically characterised by big blocks of flats, and, functionally characterised as being dormitory cities, these cities are changing into a space that tries to balance the residential and economical functions, where shopping centres, equipments and green areas are being established, and where new infrastructures are developed. The combination of all these elements aims to provide the metropolitan peripheral territory with a centrality and an individual urban balance, transforming them from satellite dormitory cities to real cities. Without leaving behind the cohesion and the integration with the rest of the metropolitan areas, the nucleuses of the big cities’ peripheries are getting more self-sufficient from an urban planning point of view. The metropolitan functional area is being restructured by the growth of the peripheral and periurban areas. The economic and social cohesion of the metropolitan areas is configured on the basis of the diffusion process of the city. However, the consideration of the functional metropolitan territory, the metropolitan area with a major level of integration, uses and values of the metropolitan spaces, is related to the interactive relation between the centre and the periphery. Both decentralization and diffusion are factors that avoid peripheral areas to turn into totally dependent on central nucleus: there is a «transfer of centrality» instead, that results into a more multipolar model. At present, urban planning approach in the metropolitan areas faces the challenge to create a sustainable model of territory utilisation, by means of instruments that link the implementation of singular uses and new growth rates to the availability of the transport infrastructures with the aim to optimise the mobility between the different parts that constitute the metropolitan system and that assures its functioning. Therefore the aim is that peripheral areas of big cities must also be cities themselves, not only parts of a city. With this aim, a new governance and a new metropolitan management are set out, supported by the following factors: • Functional diversification of economic activities and specialisation of those with bigger added value, promoting productive decentralisation and housing-labour balance in the area. • Cohesion of a single soil market, with equal opportunities for infrastructures and all kinds of equipment (educational, health, cultural, green areas, etc.). • A global soil policy at metropolitan scale, including urbanised spaces, those that need a «rehabilitation» and those to be urbanised. • The intermunicipal management and public-private agreement. The restructuring of areas determined by industrial, port, rail network, military components, among others, is a key element for the new metropolitan model. The growth of the metropolitan cities tend to turn these big areas into “opportunity spaces” since what used to be peripheral locations, are now areas with an evident potential of centrality. New centralities are generated as a result of the endogenous dynamics of the periphery, as a consequence of a public (or mixed) decision promoted by a local authority external to the central city. Hence, the new dynamics of the local governments in peripheral cities in metropolitan areas, articulated around development & urban transformation projects aimed to achieve a particular and singular city model. As far as the European Union is concerned, the urban problematic has acquired an increasing relevance in recent years. An important link between cohesion policies and the cities has been generated, stressing out the role of the cities and its contribution to the economic growth and the labour market of the regions. In this context, it is important to mention the “Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament” (COM 2006, dated 13.7.2006) Cohesion Policy and cities: the urban contribution to growth and jobs in the regions. In this respect, the main subject-matter and issues dealt by NeT-TOPIC are of special interest for the orientation and for the reference framework of the urban policies of the European Union. The subject of the NeT-TOPIC is closely related with these orientations and concerns to the extent that, the transformation of the metropolitan areas and the new role of the peripheral cities, represents a new strategic perspective to face up intraurban disparities, one of the most significant handicaps to achieve the full development of the European cities’ potential. The strategies orientated to set up new roles for these cities in the metropolitan frame represents, among other things, the need to establish a flexible cooperation between the different levels of the public sector. More specifically, cities must find, always taking into account the institutional organisation in each Member State, efficient governance methods that allow them to efficiently manage and govern these urban transformations that take place in European metropolitan areas. The new strategies of the metropolitan peripheral cities are committed with the creation of new and particular environments that ensure a multifaceted development, resulting into new metropolitan centralities, and leaving aside their historic functions of dormitory cities. Hence, there is a new concern to enter into the growth economy, by means of supporting entrepreneurship and innovation, with the aim to promote in their cities the settlement, localisation and development of SMEs and micro enterprises, that create economic activity and more and better jobs. Hence the importance of these cities, in the framework of a European strategy aimed to turn cities into real driving forces of cohesion and regional development. The aim is to create new multifunctional quality spaces, capable of attracting resources and knowledge. Internal cohesion is another key factor. The renovation of neighbourhoods and residential areas with important deficits and the improvement of mobility and accessibility are also important aspects to take into account. In short, from an European point of view, and in the framework of cohesion and regional development policies, the problem of the metropolitan areas and the current intense transformation processes, represent a key issue to ensure a polycentric and more balanced development of the big European cities.  
KEY CHALLENGES IN RELATION TO THE TOPIC. 
Faced with these situations, the peripheral metropolitan cities are considering the common challenge of managing a city change that increases the strategic value of the city’s territory in order to transform them into more attractive cities which offer greater quality of life and better citizen coexistence. A part of some of the common problems that these cities consider, such as industrial decline and territorial fragmentation caused by infrastructures, there are further factors that have influenced in the urban transformation, and need to be highlighted. These have been, on the one hand, of social nature: demographic changes and social dynamics, specifically high immigration; the drop in the predominantly young population; social polarization and, in some cases, antisocial behavior and urban delinquency. These are closely linked to factors of an economic nature: changes in the labour market delocalization of jobs towards the big city, economic diversification and trends to the tertiary sector. On the other hand, there are also problems deriving from urban morphology and infrastructures: territorial disordering, lack of houses adapted to the new demand, industrial areas in disuse and lack of building land. Mainly, these cities need to adequate the land uses with their socio-economic and territorial area trends. The main challenge of these peripheral cities is to develop a city model change process. This means, that they are transforming from peripheral cities to central cities, from residential to daytime cities (university, administrative or business centres), from industrial cities to technological/ knowledge/service cities, from mono-functional to multifunctional. This change of city model and of its positioning within the metropolitan context, represent new forms of integration for its inhabitants and citizens. The city is not only a residential space any longer. It integrates new functions, new activities, new mobility forms and new uses of the urban spaces. This represents, in synthesis, a new urban identity, an increase of the self esteem of its inhabitants and their identification with their city. The new model should promote new forms of endogenous development, expansion and consolidation of a new image of urban quality, adding visibility and recognition to the city. The achievement of these objectives is a key challenge and implies, in any case, the overcoming of numerous handicaps and difficulties. In general, practically all cities situated in metropolitan peripheries share most of the aforementioned characteristics and, therefore, they face up to similar challenges. In any case, these challenges and handicaps they must overcome, are framed within a key and strategic challenge: their transformation into new urban poles framed in metropolitan polycentric cities in the context of knowledge society and economy and of the labour market changes. Indeed, these cities, that share similar problems (industrial decline, territorial fragmentation, social polarization,...) are considering a city model change that increases the strategic value of its territory in order to transform them into more attractive cities which offer greater quality of life and better citizen coexistence. Therefore one of the biggest challenges of these cities concerns with their territorial governance and urban planning processes, throughout the promotion of new tools and approaches among their local governments in order to improve their urban transformation processes. In other words, the traditional forms of urban management and planning of the peripheral monofunctional cities, is no relevant or efficient anymore to govern cities that experiment the transformations previously commented and plan strategies for an urban change. In any case, challenges do not only arise from urban transformation processes, but from processes of territorial change, considering their belonging to metropolitan territories, where they are integrated and where they must resituate their functions, i.e., looking for niches and opportunities, but also complementarities and alliances with other cities within the metropolis as well as with the central city. Among the challenges these cities must face up, it must be avoided evident risks and threats, resulting from the competence between the different parts of the metropolitan area and of the trend of the central city to put in order the spaces that surround depending on its own centrality strategies. The different challenges aforementioned are articulated around a bigger challenge, the elaboration of a local strategy, based on the leadership of the local government, building alliances and public-private coalitions able to give cohesion to the new emerging actors, resulting from the mentioned urban transformation.  
SUB-THEMES WITHOUT LOOSING FOCUS.
The main subject matter of NeT-TOPIC is the change in urban model pursued by metropolitan peripheral cities. The identified sub-themes are derivations of this main subject and they only have sense when articulated with the main subject matter. Actually, they are no different or independent subjects, but different facets or sides of the same central subject. In any case, below it is indicated several sub-themes that we consider focal points of the main subject of NeT- TOPIC and that are considered to be key elements in the transformation of the metropolitan peripheral cities. Then, we are going to highlight other issues that are also relevant. A first issue is the building of a new (own) identity of these cities, as a result of the design and implementation of a new city model. Peripheral cities have historically been considered, and are still considered in many occasions, to be suburbs or neighbourhoods of the central city. The changes derived from this new model, must be articulated and organised so that they can have global impacts and effects of image change. The role and visibility of the local government in the leadership of these processes, that at the same time strengthen the implication and complicity of the citizens and of other private organisations and the civil society with such changes, are crucial elements in order to build a new identity and new urban and citizenship image. The second issue is related to the aforementioned urban and metropolitan governance. The restructuration of the metropolis, the emerging of new centralities and changes in the use of the territory, the new forms of mobility, require new processes of negotiation and coordination among territorial stakeholders, both public and private, and the civil society. Several issues and problems require agreement and commitment among different stakeholders in order to find solutions to new problems: the changes in the use of urban spaces, public transport, housing, new business localisation, sustainability, soil rules and requalification, etc. Actually, the urban transformations mentioned, require, in one hand, a new commitment among the governments of the territory (regional, local, national), and in the other hand, with private and social agents that operate on the metropolitan territory with new logics and that also require coordination and consensus processes. Among the new forms of local and metropolitan governance, we include a new key aspect: the need of integration of the municipal policies in a cross cutting logic, articulated around the new model of multifunctional city that the peripheral cities are considering. This implies that the traditional forms of municipal management and planification must be questioned. The third sub-theme is related to the territorial fragmentation caused by road or infrastructures networks that split territories within peripheral cities in metropolitan areas. We have to bear in mind that these urban areas have been configured as suburbs without internal cohesion, exclusively urbanised in function of the central city logics. This is a complex issue since it requires, in the first place, processes of change in the long term, in the framework of new process of metropolitan governance and in the second place, it also requires quite often investments that allow reducing the negative impact and the depth of the fragmentation, providing solutions of urban tissue integration of those cities split by metropolitan road and infrastructure networks. A fourth sub-theme is the recovering and improvement of abandoned or obsolete areas, such as old industrial or mining areas, infrastructures and installations out of use, military equipment, etc. The assignment of these areas to new uses, from the point of view of a multifunctional city, and following the logics of the new strategic model, represents at the same time an opportunity and a difficulty since those areas and resources are quite often associated to problems of property and imply a complex urban qualification. However, the recovery of these areas for new uses, coherent with the identity strategy and the endogenous development of the city, represent an added value since these reassignments of use provide high visibility of the urban transformation planned. The last sub-theme, with a clear strategic component, is the planning and management of the change from a monofunctional to a multifunctional city. This topic integrates and articulates the sub-themes aforementioned to a certain extent. It implies, among other things, the design of new centralities, the planning of new commercial axis, the combination of a city of leisure and culture, economic activity and housing. This implies to consider the urban and territorial planning starting from this strategy of diversified city with new links and interdependencies with the metropolitan area as a whole. Surely, some other sub-themes and issues could be included within the focal subject of the NeT-TOPIC, although some of them could also be integrated or related to some of the five sub-themes aforementioned. Hence, for instance, the management of the metropolitan transport, in the context of the changes in the population mobility inside a multipolar metropolis with a major diversification of its parts or areas, is an unquestionable challenge and a matter that requires a special attention. The regeneration of depressed neighbourhoods or housing areas that take in new population sectors in risk of exclusion or with low incomes (immigrants, ethnic minorities, etc.) would be another possible sub-theme. Although this is not an specific issue of this cities, this issue has an unquestionable relevance in this kind of cities, to the extent that in these peripheral areas there are districts or areas of popular housing of low cost and, therefore, they represent a centre of attraction for those sectors with a low income. Finally, it is important to bear in mind that in the framework of deep processes of urban and territorial changes, such as the ones experimented by these cities, and that at the same time represent the creation of new activities, new consumptions and new forms of mobility, it arises the issue of the environmental sustainability and the use of natural resources, the control of pollution, the recycling of waste and the utilisation of renewable energy in the city.  
HOW TO ADJUST THE TOPIC IN THE LIGHT OF PREVIOUS RESEARCH. 
Looking in the context of the different cities involved in the NeT-TOPIC network, all of them share the same pattern of urban metropolitan growing: all performed a function as a suburb or as a peripheral area within the metropolitan site. It was the growing of the metropolitan area as a whole what framed the evolution of these suburbs. The social, economic and cultural transformations that happened in our societies during the two last decades, have structured new urban realities. Peripheral cities, created and developed as mono functional sites within the metropolitan context, are now transforming their realities and establishing their own strategies. This is a very complex issue because what they have inherited reduce the real possibilities of urban change. Effectively, in practice all cities belonging to the network suffer of fragmentation and lack of urban cohesion and territorial integration as a result of the road and railroads infrastructures that cross their areas. At the same time, their industrial background supposes the existence of areas and urban spaces that need to be recovered and reintegrated in the diversified and complex new post-industrial city model, if the city wants to find and develop a new city pattern, with more cohesion, identity and quality of life for their inhabitants. In all the cases, once the different contexts, policies and experiences of urban interventions of the different cities were analyzed, arises the need of redefining the urban transformation strategies linked to a new model that transform the peripheral and mono functional city into a multifunctional city, integrated in a diversified, interdependent and multi polar metropolis. Among all the cities an agreement has been achieved to tackle and to reach different sub themes already mentioned in the first section of this document (state of the art of the topic) and the need, likewise, of avoiding new topics because it could entail loosing the focus of the strategic issues that are in the principal interest of all the cities involved in the network. Coming up from the analysis and from the remarks that took place during the Development Phase by all the involved cities in NeT-TOPIC, emerges the need of sharing experiences and reflections around the coherence between de practical interventions of urban transformation (as projects and plans) and the city model that is foreseen to be achieved. It deals with finding an answer to the following question: Are the implemented actions to improve urban quality, accessibility, housing, neighbourhoods and public spaces, effectively contributing to a new urban identity and a new city model? It is not evident that this is really taking place, at least in some of the cities belonging to NeT-TOPIC. That’s why it is obligated to achieve new knowledge and to know more about different experiences and practices that show how this is tackled in different contexts. Another issue that is remarked as well as a shared concern is the following: the peripheral cities are making the choice for an auto-centred and endogenous development, trying to respond to their own needs and searching for new links, interactions and relations with the central cities of the metropolis. But it seems clear that these peripheral cities are even now parts of a whole and are determined by the global logic of the metropolitan agglomeration. We have to find an answer to the following questions: how to define and how to build a new type of relations and connections with the central city and with the whole metropolis? 
HIGHLIGHTING PARTNERS CONCERNS ON ISSUES.
 All the partners of NeT-TOPIC share the same problems. The entire are urban poles located as suburbs or as peripheral sites of metropolitan areas. So, they are crossed by similar problems as a result of that localization and urban function. In general terms, they were configured in the time as areas of sprawl of the metropolitan city, spaces were houses and flats for the working class were concentrated during the industrialisation process. In sum: concentration of residential spaces for low rent people, industrial installations and crossed by communication infrastructures to access to the central city. In any case, there are significant differences dealing with urban dimension. From cities as Nanterre, L’Hospitalet or Sesto San Giovanni, that belong to large European metropolis, since small cities belonging to metropolitan areas of smaller dimension, mainly in those countries of central and Eastern Europe, were the urbanisation processes have followed other trends and historical evolution. In the following paragraphs we point some of the main characteristics that are facing the partner cities of NeTTOPIC. As we can see, beyond the significant differences, all of them are sharing the political and institutional will of transforming its urban function, and promoting in this way more diversified cities improving at the same time their quality of life. Indeed, they share a clear will to find new urban functions for their cities within the metropolis were they belong. In the city of L’Hospitalet (Spain) the local strategy is focused in the integration and restructuring of road en railroad infrastructures, through urban solutions as burying them. This process is already taking place and in an advanced stadium. The city focus is to identify and verify the key factors of urban intervention that can provoke significant changes in the city model. It has to be discovered which of these factors are crucial. It deals with understanding the evolution of the industrial city and with foreseeing the incidence of the different factors for planning in the frame of general processes. It entails the key factor that this new city model becomes visible and well perceived by the residents of L’Hospitalet. The city has to find a new place and a new function within the metropolitan area of Barcelona.  In Sesto San Giovanni, (Italy) the creation of an ambitious plan that does not just redevelop the disused industrial sections but will also represent an example of a new way of urban living. The project to transform the former Falck areas is intended to provide practical solutions to the issues of liveability, environmental sustainability and social cohesion. The city suffers the presence of the vast land still abandoned near the centre of the city and the presence of the railway line, which roughly divide in 2 parts the urban area. The new city model has firstly to redesign the brown field areas, using these areas to unify the separated parts of the city. The new strategic plan under construction, the Piano di Governo del Territorio, proposes to create an urban framework apt to transform the city from a fragmented factory-town to a prosperous urban community centred on a park system designed to foster new development and amenities. In the city of Salford (U.K.) links between communities could be improved. Establishing a clear and cohesive identity for the city of Salford through holistic regeneration governance: complementing rather than competing with Manchester (e.g. as residential and leisure space in Salford West). Perhaps the biggest concern for the city surrounds the cohesiveness of these projects and their effect on Salford as a whole. With so many large projects being undertaken throughout the city, the danger is that planning cohesiveness will be loss. It is vital that the city, situated so close to Manchester, develops and retains its own clear identity to ensure that it finds its own niche that complements instead of compete with its larger neighbour. In Nanterre (France) the city is faced to several challenges. For example, the adoption of new urban practices in the design of urban projects: how can we work with them avoiding to be dominated by them. Urban citizens are questioning the existing offers and asking the public authorities to examine existing policy instruments. Likewise, a central challenge concerns the articulation between projects involving the outskirts of the town and its metropolis, between urban, metropolitan, regional and national authorities. The city is faced to the challenge of being able to manage the property market to continue to offer affordable housing to most people and to offer commercial premises to maintain the existing economic diversity. In ex-añmBarakaldo, (Spain), the city has already tackled urban fragmentation with the construction of the ring road that is not finished yet. The integration of all the peripheral municipalities of Bilbao is on of the biggest challenge of the metropolitan area. Barakaldo needs and wishes a better communication with Bilbao and wants to build those bridges foreseen by the urban planning schemes (Cadagua and Nervión rivers) to complement the current communication system in the metropolitan area. Barakaldo is engaged in the conservation of its urban identity as a core city in the left border of the Nervión River. It needs to improve the connection among its neighbourhoods searching the complementarities with the other cities of the metropolitan area of Bilbao. Cultural activities and social services in the neighbourhoods need to be improved. New methods and procedures to increase citizen participation is one of the mail challenges of Barakaldo. In Semianowice (Poland) there is a clear engagement with urban transformation, especially problems related to transformation from post – industrial city to the city of sports and green along with protecting the city’s identity. Some challenges are the revitalisation of post – industrial grounds such as coal mines grounds and mine waste dumps; converting the grounds to areas of housing and services; or converting the City Centre (demolition of old buildings or renovation) to a service oriented City Centre. There are initiatives to improve the communication system (building bypasses, crossings, roundabouts etc.). In Sacele (Romania) the city council wants to improve transport and connection infrastructure, mainly the construction of the ring road of Sacele. Likewise they want to improve environment infrastructure, mainly waste water, and green space. In the other hand Sacele wants to carry out a strong public-private partnership for managing the public assets. There already exists a LTDS (Long Term Development Strategy). The LTDS was recently elaborated by the City Council and it stills remains as a guideline document to promote and set up the local development. In Kladno (Czech Republic) the Integrated Development Plan within the framework of Regional Operational Programme (2008) ROP is focused on providing the long-term life quality of the citizens through safety and favourable environment and services. It also includes the following objectives: to revitalize the public spaces and improve the environment, to revitalize the neglected city parts and intensify their development potential, to improve the public spaces and buildings face for their better long-term development; to improve the quality of public services, to consolidate the environmental safety public transportation and to improve the quality of civil amenities in the field of education, social care, health service, culture and leisure. In Haidari (Greece) the city strategy is focused on several objectives such as the preservation of the cultural identity and heritage of the city, trying to achieve a balanced and sustainable growth, in order to avoid the formation of a two speeds city. To avoid the physical obstacles that divides the city they foresee to create underground passages and elevated bridges (Pedestrians) aiming at making easier the National road’s crossing, with elevator facilities for the disabled people. As well, one of the main challenges of Haidari is the development and exploitation of downgraded regions in order that each of the 5 neighborhoods of the municipality obtains its relative autonomy and to reduce its internal transports. 
HOW TO TARGET DESIRED OUTCOMES AND SEEK TO IMPROVE QUALITY OF EXPECTED RESULTS.
 The desired and foreseen outputs that the project wants to achieve deal with the learning and knowledge generated around the core theme of the network that is the change of the development model of the peripheral metropolitan cities. This goal wouldn’t be just the result of an exchanging activity or of sharing knowledge around good practices implemented by the associated cites. It should also integrate the outputs achieved by each city through the local support groups and the local action plans It is very important to carry out a good integration between the practices to be developed in each city with the exchange activities at the network level. Thereby the participation of each city in the exchanges activities and in the production of new knowledge’s and learning’s will be directly connected with the progress and development of its own strategy of urban transformation. As we can see through the themes and the sub themes already defined as axes that structure the NeT-TOPIC network, different cities will contribute to the knowledge production, learning and practices about strategies and actions to transform the urban model in peripheral cities located in metropolitan areas. Obviously, each city is going to stress out those aspects and themes that concerns it more directly linked to its own territorial context, to their priorities and to its development state and accumulated experience in urban issues. The network wants to produce new learning, new knowledge and to generate recommendations and proposals in his thematic domain. We can conclude that NeT-TOPIC will produce outputs at two different levels: 1. At the network level, as a result of the exchanges, analyse and comparison of practices, analysis of partners city strategies and contributions from out of NeT-TOPIC, either from cities or from academic bodies. At this level, NeT-TOPIC will produce practical outputs as an effect of systematisation and capitalisation of that knowledge framed in the thematic focus “how peripheral and metropolitan cities establish renovated urban practices with the aim of changing their development model”. As en effect of the network activities, several outputs will be produced, for example, a Guidelines and Recommendations for carrying out Urban Planning processes for this kind of cities, a systematisation and capitalisation of learning on good urban practices and different practical recommendations at European level and as a result of shared experiences carried out within the network by the city partners. Of course, all these outputs will be linked to all those sub themes that were defined as key issues by the members of the network, as the following: - Building a new urban identity - Best practices for a good metropolitan governance and new forms or partnership and coordination of urban policies - Solutions and answers for the urban fragmentation processes - Strategies to achieve multifunctional cities and new roles within the metropolis - Good practices in the recovering of obsolete and abandoned urban areas. 2. At local level in each partner city, the establishment, development and improvement of urban transformation strategies of the city model within de different metropolitan areas were these cities belong will come out as main outputs. These outputs will depend on the situation of the urban policies in each one of the cities, but in any case, cities engage themselves to produce their own LAPs and to ensure the active participation and the consolidation of the ULSG as spaces of reflection, participation, monitoring and evaluation of the strategic actions in each city. So, at the end of NeT-TOPIC activities each one of the partner cities should feed the network with a very clear and defined output, elaborated with the following elements: - A Local Action Plan (with different definition and structure according to each case) elaborated in a practical and operational way that will define the city strategy concerned with the own issues of the network. Not all the cities should focus on all the themes of the network. Just in those that the city considers more relevant regarding its own context. - Systematisation and capitalisation of the experiences carried out by the ULSG as a space of cooperation among local actors concerning the themes of NeT-TOPIC and the elaboration of the LAP. The experience and activities of the ULSG should become an added value in each one of the cities as a positive experience of public-private partnership around the strategy of urban transformation in metropolitan contexts. - A reinforced bond of knowledge and cooperation among each one of the partner’s cities and the managing authority of each country as a result of the participation of this body in the ULSG, in the monitoring of the project, in the outputs of the LAP and in the specific outputs of the network linked to its own thematic field. The participation of the cities in NeT-TOPIC should generate local impacts, as learning and new proposals that have to be relevant and visible at the urban policies level in each country. Obviously, these three levels interact between them and they feed each other. At the city level, the generated outputs as a result of the exchanges within the network will become inputs for each ULSG, for each LAP and for each local authority. On the contrary the realised experience in each city will become a contribution for the network activity in terms of knowledge production, systematisation and capitalisation of practices. In each case, the contribution of each city to the network activities will focus in those themes and issues that are priorities in its own local context.

"NODUS.
Linking Urban Renewal and Regional Spatial Planning.

Introduction: What is NODUS for?
The ’internal integration’ of area based policies is a well known requirement for spatially concentrated urban redevelopment actions, aiming at stakeholder inclusion, and horizontal connections between the different policy fields in the neighbourhoods selected for public interventions. The ’external integration’ of area based policies is less emphasized, although the vertical multi-level governance links, the spatial connections between the selected neighbourhoods and the other (better included) areas of the city and the functional connections to broader policies are considered to be increasingly important. NODUS focuses on this second type, external integration of area based policies, concentrating on the links between regional level planning, governance and local area-based urban regeneration. The aim is to improve the coordination between these policies at supra-local (regional) level in order to achieve more balanced urban development. In a narrower sense, the methodological aspect of NODUS is to develop a methodology how to act on supra-local (metropolitan, regional) level to assign the worst neighbourhoods as local renewal areas, how to implement area-based interventions and how to ensure that such interventions (combined with other public policies) lead to balanced results from supra-local perspective. 
1.1. European views on integrated urban development: the need for public planning and policies on wider urban scale (theoretical overview)
1.1.1. The challenge of sustainability and social inclusion in European urban development.
European urban development is largely affected today and in the future by sustainability and social inclusion challenges. Regarding the sustainability aspect, many analyses have shown the dramatic consequences of un-coordinated, sprawling urban development. The European Environmental Agency (EEA, 2006:24) draws up three scenarios for one of the booming European cities by 2020. The ‘business as usual’ and the even more market determined ‘scattered development’ scenarios lead to further expansion of the built-up area, with sharply increasing commuter movements by car, causing dramatic decline in the quality of the environment. The only acceptable ‘compact development’ scenario, on the other hand, would require strict spatial regulation measures at metropolitan level, which do not exist today in most European cities. According to the conclusion of the analysis the sustainability of future urban development can only be achieved with the help of larger-scale, metropolitan or regional planning which has to steer and regulate local urban development processes. Similar to the sustainability issue, social inclusion problems, socio-spatial segregation and the related decline of certain areas can not be considered just as a local phenomenon. The causes, forces behind segregation processes, that result in physical decline and the concentration of deprived population within certain areas, are to a large extent determined at supra-local level. The evolution of real estate and land markets and their demographic and economic impacts, having strong effects on the inequalities, are also metropolitan and regional area level processes. Despite these wide-spread negative territorial effects, public interventions against social exclusion and deprivation are usually concentrating on the worst areas and there is very little understanding regarding the need for metropolitan or regional planning as co-ordination mechanisms above the localised area-based interventions. 
1.1.2. Changing public perceptions of tackling spatially concentrated social problems.
 The public interventions to deal with spatially concentrated social problems show remarkable changes in the half century. In the first after-war decades deteriorated neighbourhoods were not at all in the focus of public interventions as these concentrated on the development of new areas, in the spirit of solving the problem of quantitative shortage of housing. It was only in the 1970s that in some European countries the qualitative aspects of urban development gained ground. At the beginning, however, this did not mean more than the physical renewal of the housing stock to improve the most deteriorating areas. In the 1980s increasing amounts of financial means were spent on physical renewal. The results of such interventions were, however, very limited: the renovated neighbourhoods started soon to deteriorate again, or, if this did not happen and the area improved, the original poor residents had to leave, not being able to pay the increasing prices/rents. By the 1990s it became clear that area based interventions have to be integrated to achieve lasting success. The new approach aimed at coordinating physical with economic and social interventions, leading to integrated area-based urban renewal. In this sense integration means coordination between functions (housing, employment, social welfare, etc.) and also between sectors (public, private, voluntary). The 1990s and the 2000s can be considered as the heydays of this spatially concentrated, functionally integrated approach, which was also included into the philosophy of the EU Structural Funds, in the form of the very successful URBAN Community Initiative. Public interventions have many types, ranging from general (e.g. income support, pension schemes) through functional (e.g. housing allowances, health care subsidies) until area-based interventions. The strive for functional integration increased the belief in the area-based programmes, as the different types of public interventions seem to be integrated the easiest on the basis of a limited area. 
1.1.3. The theory and practice of integrated area-based urban regeneration.
The figure below (developed by Claude Jacquier in the course of the Regenera Urbact 1 project, see Jacquier-Bienvenue-Schlappa, 2007) helps to understand the basic options for area based interventions. Without any intervention the area depicted in the t(0) time period deteriorates and therefore declines regarding its relative position in the local housing market. Dependent on the strengths and content of public and private interventions, in the t(n) time period there are four options regarding the further changes in the relative position of the area: A1: Without any intervention deterioration will continue and the area will further decline towards the bottom of the local housing market. This leads to the disintegration of the area both in physical and social terms, as only the most disadvantaged people will remain in the area which will also attract other disadvantaged people. A2: A limited scale public intervention into the physical structure can stop the decline of the area. This is, however, most likely only a temporary solution as after a while, in the absence of further public interventions, the deterioration will continue. A3: With a strong, market based private intervention the area can be improved substantially. Investments come from outside-the-area investors who recognize the potential high value of the area, which, however, can only be achieved with total change of the local population. The name of this process, gentrification, refers to the necessarily higher status of the new residents, replacing the original residents who have to leave the area. A4: This is the option of publicly financed integrated urban regeneration, ‘for’ and ‘with’ the local population. This is the most difficult option, as the level of public intervention must be high enough and must achieve the needed complexity (integration of different sectoral policies), while large-scale investments by private actors have to be kept away, not allowing the gentrification of the area. From the difficulties to achieve the ‘optimal’ A4 option it can easily be understood why this option is relatively rarely occurring in real practice. Another difficulty with A4 is its instability. Even if the A4 option proves to be the best regarding the chosen neighbourhood, it is not at all sure that the successful regeneration of the area with preserving the original residents will last for long. In fact, the opposite is more likely (as the critical analysts of area based programmes claim): either the original residents have to leave due to the increasing prices sooner or later the area which becomes gentrified, or the level of the needed continuous improvements can not be kept and deterioration starts. Despite the major difficulties, A4 is considered as the best option, for the promotion of which strong public policies have been set up in many countries. In the last two programming periods, even the European Union issued a programme (URBAN) for the explicit support for integrated area-based regeneration of deteriorated urban areas. For the illustration of such programmes in the practice, it is worth to summarize the basic elements of the URBAN regulation. According to the philosophy of URBAN the high concentration of social, environmental and economic problems of urban conglomerations can be tackled with complex operations combining the rehabilitation of obsolete infrastructure with economic and labour market actions (job creation), complemented by measures to combat social exclusion (education and training) and upgrade the quality of the environment. The URBAN programme laid down strict criteria for the selection of target areas. These must have been deteriorated (proven by indicators) from physical, social and economic point of view, as well. For the eligible areas, which had in the URBAN 1 programme the average size of 6 square kilometer and a mimimum population of 20 thousand, integrated development concept had to be prepared for 5-7 years period, in a broad partnership involving all the parties concerned. The majority of the URBAN programmes has been implemented in cities over 100 thousand population. The EU financial means were not at all very big (with an average of 10 million euro for an area), however the required 50% co-financing and the inclusion of the population, the civil sector and the market actors made substantial improvements possible. With the integrated schemes of URBAN the quality of life in the targeted areas could considerably be improved. 1.1.4. Theoretical debates about area based interventions.
The supporters of area-based interventions argue (Vranken-De Decker-Van Nieuwenhuyze, 2003:61) that although general anti-poverty programmes are essential, direct interventions into the most deprived neighbourhoods are of basic importance. Such interventions are needed to correct market failures (the capital avoids problematic neighbourhoods) and to empower the residents, improving their access to mainstream job opportunities and other institutions of the society. However, from the end of the 1990s increasing number of analyses of area-based integrated urban regeneration projects result in critical remarks. Such critics point out how restricted in spatial sense improvements are, leading at the same time to huge external effects, as a result of pushing out the most ‘problematic’ residents from the improved neighbourhoods. In many cases not even the most deprived areas are selected for integrated regeneration. The limited and targeted interventions can always be considered as the easiest way to calm down the bad consciousness of the society: it is easy to say that the public has done its best with spending some money in the worst areas and if things do not improve in the chosen areas it is the fault of the people who live there. Research has shown that even successful area based initiatives can have some perverse effects: real results in one small area (with concentrating all public means to that area) might not prove the overall success of the interventions as the rest of the city might suffer badly from the lack of attention and money. To achieve ‘easy results’ in small neighbourhoods often only aims at political goals (especially in election periods) instead of lasting improvement in larger urban areas. Further arguments doubt the potentials of area based policies from wider societal perspectives. Such „… approaches simply displace problems between different neighbourhoods and do not add to the overall economic and social well-being of the city as a whole – they are the equivalent of rearranging the desk chairs of the Titanic…”. This is the more true as „… the causes on the problems and the potential solutions … lie outside the excluded areas.” (Vranken-De Decker-Van Nieuwenhuyze, 2003:62) Another phrasing of this statement is as follows: “Social cohesion is put forward as the ‘problem’ of poor neighbourhoods, forgetting that it concerns the whole of the society.” (Kesteloot-Cassiers, 2008:57) “The possibilities for changing the spatial conditions of inequality are … few and difficult. … there is a danger to focus on the neighbourhood scale and forget about other geographical scales, leaving solutions at a higher level, such as making the poor richer or giving equal rights to immigrants, aside. This means that the interest in spatial policies as a solution to the problem of disadvantaged urban neighbourhoods is likely to offer only partial solutions, and maybe even counter-productive to the extent that they distract from the more fundamental processes leading to serious disadvantage at the household level.” (Kesteloot-Cassiers, 2008:59) Besides questioning the efficiency of area-based interventions some authors raise doubts about their rationale. Musterd-Ostendorf (2008:87) point out that the usual argument for area-based interventions is based on the belief that “… neighbourhoods in decline are highly segregated neighbourhoods, that segregation is increasing, and that this segregation is producing its own negative effects…”. The authors show that research does not underpin these assumptions: in Dutch cities segregation levels are moderate and are not increasing. Higher income groups are more segregated than those with lower incomes. Even in the poorest neighbourhoods the share of middle income families exceeds the share of the poor households, thus “… the poor are not cut off from society, even in the poorest neighbourhoods.” Although the Dutch situation has its own specificities (among which one is the long history of area-based efforts to combat social exclusion problems) it is not unique at all compared to other European countries. It seems to be a common European practice that political discourses are separated from empirical research and facts. As research in many countries has proved that poverty is not confined to poor neighbourhoods, it is not a surprise that for example in Sweden “… only five per cent of the poor were reached via area-based policies.” (Andersson-Musterd, 2005). As Musterd and Ostendorf put it (2008:90) “… area-based interventions may result in missing the social targets to a great extent…”. There were a number of EU financed research projects (such as BETWIXT and URBEX) which also reached the conclusion that neighbourhood level interventions are not enough to fight poverty (Cameron-Gilroy, 2008:23). In order to improve the efficiency of area-based interventions, the idea of “social mix” has been raised. The original version of this idea aimed to achieve in poor neighbourhoods better mix of different housing categories, with the hope that a supply of new good quality housing will attract new affluent households, leading to better social mix of local residents. Evaluation of such policies (e.g. the Dutch Big City Policy), however, showed problems: “… the idea of attracting the better-off to settle in disadvantaged neighbourhoods appeared not to work.” (Musterd- Ostendorf, 2008:83). In a later version of this policy the aim has been modified „… social mix can at least offer the opportunity to successful households to stay in the neighbourhood. This means that they will not have to run up the downward escalator and leave the neighbourhood.” (Vranken-De Decker-Van Nieuwenhuyze, 2003:61) A practice of the social mix strategy can be shown on the case of the Dutch urban renewal programmes in which a part of cheap dwellings are demolished, and replaced by more comfortable dwellings offered to successful local households, i.e. not only for families from outside the neighbourhood. The success of area based projects, however, depends also on the possibility „…to provide decent jobs within the neighbourhood (or within distance that is easy to bridge).” (Vranken-De Decker-Van Nieuwenhuyze, 2003:62) Very recent examples on social mix policies show new dilemmas to emerge. This strategy can easily become too much ‘fashionable’, applied without careful analysis of local circumstances and/or leaving important aspects out of consideration. In many cases large-scale demolition programmes are launched in lower status neighbourhoods with reference to social mix policies but with no or little regard on the external effects and on other social consequences. In the case of Paris, for example, large scale demolition in the banlieus (large prefabricated housing estates in the outer parts of the city) are heavily criticized by social analysts referring to the fact that in the same areas there is a huge shortage of social housing. Social mix ideas, if not applied carefully and in combination with other public interventions, might be in sharp contradiction with the social goals of housing policy. A recent case for this can be traced in the four largest Dutch cities which apply urban regeneration through the demolition of some of the worst housing stock with cheap public units and the creation of high-value new owner occupied housing. The aim is to increase social mix through the creation of housing mix which might attract middle and higher income people back to the city, into the new high quality housing built in the previously poor neighbourhoods. For this policy there is an investment budget of 1.4 billion euros given by the national government with additional resources from urban authorities and housing corporations for the period 2005-2009. However, these cities are criticized by analysts that with attracting higher-income residents through positioning their urban areas in the competition of the VINEX locations (large scale new developments outside their territory) their real aim is to increase their tax base, which leads at the same time to unacceptable social consequences. 
3. Synthesis: a more precise definition of NODUS.
The most important aim of the preparatory phase was to make the original idea behind NODUS more precise, taking the remarks and expectations of the project partners into account and also making a use of the exploratory study prepared by the lead expert. Moreover, the agreed agenda for the remaining 20 months’ work had to be partitioned into smaller work packages in the form of a detailed work plan. The discussions about the aims of NODUS took various forms, such as full project meeting, two rounds of questionnaires sent to the project partners, individual clarifications of some points in personal meetings and in the form of telephone calls. In the course of this process step by step also the expectations towards the Local Action Plans became clarified and parallel to this, the composition of the Urbact Local Support Groups has been further developed by the project partners.  
3.1. Aims and objectives.
3.1.1. The initial aim of NODUS. 
The initial objective of Nodus, as expressed in the “Declaration of Interest for Working Groups” delivered to Urbact Secretariat in February, was “to develop a series of recommendations for the improvement of the coordination of area-based urban regeneration policies and regional or metropolitan planning, taking into account the relationships between urban regeneration and those sectorial policies with a spatial impact designed at a regional or metropolitan level, such as housing or transport infrastructures, and the fact that these different policy elements are defined by different agencies often belonging to different administrative levels”. The Working Group was, thus, defined as “focused on the links between urban regeneration and spatial planning elements that influence regional development and spatial segregation. The WG aims at studying how spatial planning reckons with urban regeneration policies and projects -when it does- considering that spatial planning, related sectorial policies and urban regeneration policies are often determined by different administrative agencies or levels. The objective is to define recommendations to improve the coordination of regeneration policies and regional or metropolitan spatial planning, to help technicians and decision-makers to foster positive feed-back effects and to balance urban development at a supralocal level”. 
3.1.2. The discussions and debates about the aims of NODUS 
The main idea of NODUS, i.e. that of linking together different policy areas (that of planning and urban regeneration) and different territorial levels (that of sub-local/regional and local) was very well accepted by all project partners. In the course of the debates, however, important modifications were suggested. Regarding the content, partners suggested a broader definition of those policy areas which should be analysed according to their links to area-based urban regeneration. Besides the originally meant spatial planning the more general level of strategic planning was mentioned (provided that the strategic plan does not remain on general, theoretical level, i.e. it produces spatially relevant ideas, especially regarding urban development plans for spatially defined areas). Moreover, as an important additional aspect, the government/governance structure has been brought forward as a crucial dimension (precondition) for the steering of all spatially relevant regeneration activities. Both for the regional administrations and for the core municipalities (the two types of partners in NODUS) it is very important to clarify these relationships in their territory, getting a clear picture what kind of institutions, formal and/or informal organizations exist between the levels of the administrative city and the administrative region. Regarding the approach, the partners acknowledged the mainly methodology-oriented interest of the lead partner. However, strong arguments have been raised to enlarge this scope with contextual aspects, such as the collection of good practices about how to link in practice the regeneration activities of the different actors in multi-level government systems. This means that some partners are definitively more interested in learning about the content of area-based interventions than about making the methods more precise – acknowledging, of course, also the importance of the methodological issues. Even the methodological aspects have been asked to be interpreted in a broader sense, including e.g. the discussion about the size of intervention areas – which, as the theoretical overview pointed out on the basis of the debates about the usefulness of area-based interventions, is one of the important aspects through which the efficiency of public interventions could be improved. It is clear from the composition of the NODUS group that partners are on different levels regarding their experiences in integrated urban regeneration. To avoid the total split between the more and the less experienced partners, NODUS should be able to produce new information and knowledge for both groups. In the course of these efforts, of course, also the large differences between the availability and preciosity of statistical, technical and cartographic information across the partner countries has to be taken into account. 
3.1.3. The modified aims of NODUS.
 The debates in the preparatory phase among project partners can be summarized as follows: it is important to pay equal attention to the governance and planning policy issues, the areabased approach has to be evaluated more critically as originally meant and the contextual and methodological aspects should get a more balanced weight throughout the work of NODUS. On the basis of this statements and the results of the detailed exploratory work (summarized in the theoretical chapter of the State of the Art section of this study) the new challenge for NODUS can be phrased in the following way: to explore those elements in the governance system and in the supra-local planning policy of the metropolitan area, on the basis of which area-based regeneration can content-wise and methodologically be further improved, leading to better re-integration of the public interventions regarding balanced urban development on higher territorial levels and in broader functional sense. Thus during this ‘second integration’ of area-based interventions important goals have to be achieved, that of • territorial balance (a selection process organized from the higher territorial level should ensure not only that the worst areas are selected but should also deal with the links of these areas with each other and with opportunity areas and should address the likely problems of external effects) • functional balance (large enough areas have to be selected to include significant share of problem households, and also external aspects from outside the areas should be taken into account). With this approach NODUS aims to find potential answers on those critical remarks against area-based interventions, which emphasized the too strong belief in relationships within narrowly defined neighbourhoods, despite the facts that in reality social life and social interactions are less and less tied to the narrow neighbourhood level. NODUS might help to find the new role of and the new methods for integrated urban policies under the new conditions that social opportunities are decreasingly neighbourhood-related and the support of the social mobility of individuals and households must be addressed also with less area-based tools – of course, in co-ordination with the still necessary area-based integrated interventions. To operationalize this briefly described complex approach, the following four stages are to be elaborated in a consecutive way by the project partners: • to discuss and identify the supra-local area (province, metropolitan area, county, …) which might give the administrative basis for the development and integration of areabased urban regeneration projects with the help of regional spatial/strategic planning policies • to work out the methodological details of the approach, including the definition of deprivation (indicators to be used), the size of the areas to be selected and the method to identify the most deprived areas within the wider area • to determine the content of the interventions which are to be done in the selected neighbourhoods (first, internal integration). to discuss how to assure and control the required balanced functioning of the interventions over the whole area from territorial and functional points of view (second integration). The biggest achievement of NODUS would be to raise some first hypotheses how these new challenges can be addressed in European urban areas. 
3.2. A proposal for the content of the work.
The project (and the final report that will reflect the results and describe the process followed to achieve them) will be structured into three main blocks. The first one is dedicated to what can be called ‘The frameworks’. There are two main sections in this block. The first is devoted to the state of the art on the link between urban governance, regional spatial planning and urban regeneration (see chapter 1 of this Baseline Study) which will be further developed during the implementation phase of NODUS. The second (see chapter 2 of this Baseline Study) is devoted to the administrative framework of the regions and cities involved in the project which also have to be further developed and made more precise. The central part of the project will be the development and application of a complex approach aimed to facilitate the integration of urban regeneration projects with regional spatial planning and governance. The details of this complex approach can be found in the four stages described in the previous section. This means that project partners have to work in a consecutive way on the following issues: • the identification of the supra-local administrative level • the methodological factors to determine deprived areas • the content of the interventions to be done in the neighbourhoods • the control to assure territorial and functional balance over the whole area. Thus, after answering questions of the type of “Do regions and cities have experience in identifying deprived areas from a regional or city level? “, or “How do they do it?”, “ If not, how could they do so?”, a complex tool will be created. In the first part of this process the first two stages will be elaborated, focusing on governance issues and exploring, evaluating statistical and cartographic data. The different experiences (but also the limitations) will be taken into account to select the potential areas for the integrated interventions. Having proved the usefulness of this approach, chapter 6 focuses on the last two stages, on the actions to be undertaken by the different cities and regions in the designed areas. The process here is quite similar to that followed in chapter 5. It starts by collecting and comparing the different experiences to extract the common elements that can be redefined to be applied for many other cities and regions in general. Thus, at the first section of the chapter some fundamental questions must be answered: “Do cities and urban areas act upon the identified areas?”; “Do they act using governance aspects and spatial plans?”; “Are regeneration projects/programmes linked with spatial plans?”; “Are their actions focused in a mainly regional impact –for example, a strategic project for the region or in a local impact -for example, actions addressed to prevent social inequalities-?”; “What kind of difficulties do they find?; “How do they overtake them?”. After having collected all these answers, the establishment of some criteria to act upon deprived areas will be based in the experiences of several and diverse cities and regions. Next, the proposing of actions to specific deprived areas in every region will configure the implementation phase. The project will finish with some conclusions and recommendations, which, together with the specific tools developed to identify the deprived areas, will become the real added value of the project.

"Introduction Urban mobility 
Since mobility is crucial to quality of life, a significant link with the urban transport system exists. Both directly influence people’s daily life and activities, and play a key role in all functions of society. They also influence opportunities to engage in social activities and interact with social communities. 6 However, though mobility makes a crucial contribution to the socioeconomic growth of urban areas, the positive effects have to be also weighed alongside the negative impacts of the increasing car mobility over the last 20 years. Cities are a critical part of the transport system, not least because, as pointed out by the recently adopted European Commission (EC) Action Plan on urban mobility, more than 72% (UN, 2007) of Europeans live in an urban area and this percentage is expected to increase. Cities are the powerhouses of economic growth and development, since around 85% of the EU’s GDP is generated in urban areas. At the same time, 40% of total CO2 emissions and 70% of emissions of other pollutants are caused by urban motorised traffic. Challenges like road traffic congestion, road safety, environmental impacts (any discussion on the future urban mobility and urban transportation system must take account of policies aimed at reaching the EU’s ambitious CO2 reduction targets of ‘20-20-20’), urban sprawl, increasing transport distances (mainly satisfied by private car ownership) are common to many European cities. The need to solve these problems has become even more crucial to maintaining a high quality of life in a sustainable way, and competitive, smooth mobility of people and goods. Urban mobility is crucially embedded in the daily life of EU citizens and is thus of primary concern for them. This was shown by a survey conducted by Eurobarometer in July 2007, in which 90% of Europeans said that the traffic situation in their area should be improved (Eurobarometer, 2007). ‘More sustainable’ is thus the main goal that underpins current approaches to and solutions for future mobility. Sustainability should lie at the heart of all policies and strategies for a more sustainable transport system in environmental (CO2, air pollution, noise) and competitiveness (congestion) terms, while also addressing social concerns. This is why the concept of sustainability goes far beyond the need to respond by managing road traffic flows and their impacts, because it should also address, for instance, the cost of mobility in relation to social exclusion, economic and social cohesion, and the demographic changes that will shape the structure of European cities in the future. Making urban mobility more accessible, efficient, environmentally friendly and inclusive is not easy. It has to consider all that factors that depend on how urban transport itself develops in the future, and the directions in which it will move based on technological progress, demographic changes, socioeconomic and environmental development and the effects they will generate. 
Cycling and walking: Concepts and current problems The benefits of cycling and walking 
Different European and international studies have classified these benefits in the following groups: (i) transport efficiency, (ii) environmental benefits, (iii) health and fitness issues, and (iv) economic and social impacts. Transport efficiency. Cycling and walking are efficient approaches to decrease peak hour car traffic and peak hour PT traffic. Therefore the modal shift towards cycling and walking makes the entire transport system of a city more efficient. Every second car trip in urban areas is shorter than 5km and could be done in 20 minutes or less by bike. For these short distances and especially in congested cities, cycling is the fastest and most flexible mode for ‘door to door’ travel. About 10 % of the car trips in cities are shorter than 1 km this is a distance that cold be done as pedestrian. ??Bicycle parking does not use much space and is cheaper: 7-10 bicycles can be parked in the space required for a single car. The space consumption of a parked bicycle has been calculated at only 8% of the space consumption of a car (Wittink (ed), 2001; Héran, 2002). Short-distance trips by motor vehicles are the least fuel-efficient and generate the most pollution per kilometre. These trips could be potentially replaced by cycling or / and walking. ??Cycling and walking are the most energy efficient means of transport. The cyclists and pedestrians emit nothing into the atmosphere and is virtually silent. Reducing car trips would alleviate ozone depletion, the greenhouse effect, photochemical smog, and noise pollution. Health and fitness issues. Regular cycling and walking has significant social and health benefits and can therefore help reduce health care costs for society as a whole. Cycling and/or walking has the same effect on health as other types of exercise and motion. Four hours of cycling per week or approximately 10 km of cycling or 3 km walking per day, which for some people is the equivalent of a daily trip to and from home to work, is an adequate level of exercise. Cycling and walking contributes to personal health by enhancing fitness and providing an enjoyable, convenient and affordable means of exercise and recreation. Benefits of regular physical activity. Reduces the risk of premature death from heart disease. Reduces the risk of developing diabetes. Reduces the risk of developing high blood pressure. Helps reduce blood pressure in people who already have high blood pressure. Reduces the risk of developing colon and breast cancer. Reduces feelings of depression and anxiety. Helps control weight. Helps build and maintain healthy bones, muscles and joints. Helps older adults become stronger and better able to move about without falling. Promotes psychological well-being Source: Evidence on the impact of the physical activity and its relationship to health. Department of Health, London (2004) More than a third of Europeans are not sufficiently physically active (WHO, 2002), and the obesity rate is estimated to have increased by 10-40% from the late 1980s to the late 1990s. In industrialised countries, physical inactivity is the second most important risk factor – after tobacco smoking – for poor health. Nevertheless benefits related to cycling are not only individual; the entire society benefits by having a healthy and fit population. Cycling saves society a considerable amount of money3 Economic and Social impacts Cycling and walking provides access and transport to segments of the population who would not otherwise be able to travel independently. These include people who: cannot own a motor vehicle; do not have access to a motor vehicle for a required period; can’t use public transport. It should be considered that 21% of Europeans are children under the age of 18 who cannot drive a vehicle (because of the minimum driving age). Nevertheless, everybody has a right to mobility and to participate in outdoor activities. Cycling makes a wider range of destinations possible for more people than walking. In combination with public transport, cycling and walking can even compete with the car over long distances. Driving is also expensive, whereas cycling is an inexpensive means of transport well within the financial reach of almost everyone. For each kilometre travelled, travel costs for the bicycle are lower than those of any other means of transport, and walking is the least expensive mode of transport. Pedestrians and cyclists save parking charges. Travel budgets can therefore be reduced considerably by cycling and walking. Increasing bicycle use and increased level of walking may eliminate the need for a second car, again leading to considerable savings. 3 In one United States study, it was estimated that costs associated with inactivity are between USD 24.3 and 37.2 billion (2.4-3.7% of total health care costs) (WHO, 2002). A Swiss study estimated that insufficient levels of physical activity impose cost of SFR 1.4 billion a year (WHO, 2002). About two thirds of Canadians are physically inactive, resulting in about CAD 2.1 billion of direct health care costs in Canada (Canadian Medical Association Journal, 28 November 2000). 
Current major problems 
Cycling is not always easy or enjoyable. Cyclists face major problems related to the lack or inadequacy of road infrastructure, scarcity of parking facilities, safety and security of cyclists and weather conditions. Finally, intermodality is still poor in many European cities. Lack of awareness of decision makers. Cycling is not seen as an appropriate approach to manage the transport situation in urban areas by planners and decision makers in many European cities. There is a lack of information and awareness amongst the local stakeholders concerning the potential of cycling. This is very often connected with the fact that the majority of the decision makers have no or little experience with this mode of transport. In this way very often the user needs of the cyclists are rarely analysed and user participation is only known in countries with a high cycling culture. Cyclists’ safety and security Cycling and walking needs an appropriate infrastructure that provides separate space to move safely in the main axes of a city. Only in countries with a high cycling culture like the Netherlands or Denmark separate cycling tracks an advanced solutions to inbound the cycling traffic at junctions are provided In some cities there are cycling tracks but insufficient design of the intersections – these is even less save than no cycle tracks. The absence of separated pavements leads also to unsafe situations. There are still many cities that doesn’t provide speed limit 30 km/h for the roads beside the main roads and those who have introduced id have sometimes insufficient enforcement. Lack of bicycle parking facilities. The scarcity of bicycle parking facilities in city centres and main attractions discourages cyclists from using their bicycles for regular trips. The major threat here is that bicycle theft is currently a big problem. Many cities are tackling this relatively successfully by introducing innovative anti-theft devices in new bicycles. Supervised or locked bicycle parking may help to prevent damage to bicycles and vandalism. Parking facilities are also required to allow users to change from bike wear into everyday clothes. Good fully equipped bicycle parking facilities should offer services for cyclists like bicycle accessory shops, bicycles to rent, and lockers. Poor image of Cycling In some countries especially in the new member states Cycling is perceived as a mode for poor and less successful people (MAX SUCCESS 2009). In other countries especially southern countries cycling is seen as a leisure time activity and not as a means of transport for shopping trips or home to work trips. In many European city there is a socialisation towards car traffic that includes a lot of children trips on the back seat of their parents car. This “back seat generation” perceive the car transport as the normal way to move from A to B in a city. Projects like BAMBINI try to socialize people towards sustainable modes. More information is available at: http://www.mobile-bambini.eu and www.trendy-travel.eu Poor intermodality. At present, very few cities have equipped their public transport with bicycle racks, and the carriage of bicycles is allowed only outside rush hours. Some German and Dutch railway companies are changing their rolling stock to provide commuter trains with more bicycle racks. Fortunately, thanks also to EU funded projects, more cities have started to implement bicycle sharing. The idea of offering public bicycles at the main railway or subway stations gives residents a choice of modes of travel.
 Synthesis 
What was an idea at the very beginning of the project has shown clearly during the phase 1. Transport is the main communal problems within the partner cities. All partner cities analysed their situation based upon a methodology presented and agreed at the kick off meeting. The site visits of the Lead Expert brought valuable insight and detailed information of the situation of each visited city. Furthermore it gave the opportunity to meet members of the Local Support Groups to discuss the problems and possible and planned approaches of ACTIVE TRAVEL NETWORK so that everybody clearly understands what we plan to do and that a coherent project could have been designed. The topic of enhancing walking and cycling (the so called active transport modes) as strategy to tackle transport problems in all partner cities has been defined as appropriate by all partners. All cities - lack of an appropriate integrated cycle / walking policies - have a high potential of short car trips which could easily be shifted towards walking and cycling - don’t had a working group / support group dealing with this topic before the start of phase 1 of ACTIVE TRAVEL NETWORK - Since there is already a lot of know how and knowledge regarding infrastructure and infrastructure planning available (within the cities but also as materials such as handbooks etc.) but each city lacks of know how and knowledge regarding - appropriate push & pull strategies (to enhance desired behaviour while at the same time avoid un-desired behaviour) - raising awareness - marketing, - changing the people’s thinking (especially stakeholders) and behaviour (citizens), - organisation of non-motorised transport, - combining walking and cycling with public transport and of course - education and training the approach for the ACTIVE TRAVEL NETWORK project which has been chosen is MOBILITY MANAGEMENT and TRAVEL AWARENESS. Both, Mobility Management & Travel Awareness as such and cycling and walking as means of transport play a crucial role in the European policies and strategies for tackling problems of urban transport. The State-of-the Art report in this baseline study shows clearly the strategically ideas behind it. Also the several good and best practice examples all over Europe proof that these policies do not only exist on paper but have already been successfully implemented. The EC has already funded projects in the field of AVTIVE TRAVEL NETWORK that will be taken as basis for a further development and for setting up the Local Action Plans in the partner cities. Among these projects the following ones should be mentioned: BYPAD: This SAVE project developed a Bicycle Policy Audit scheme that is implemented already in more than 100 cities all over Europe. This scheme will be improved within ACTIVE TRAVEL NETWORK by adding the pedestrian part. MAX-SUCCESS: The biggest mobility management and travel awareness research project ever funded by the EC under FP 6 (completed in 2009). It provides a series of tools (e.g regarding design, monitoring and evaluation of campaigns). The RAVE – the Green Ray of Novara - project (funded within LIFE) aimed at cooperation between private and public organisations to create a complete and integrated local active mobility system in town. The INTERREG Alpine Space Project VIANOVA – Healthy Mobility and Intelligent Intermodality In Alpine Areas proofed that Mobility Management approaches to enhance cycling and walking are appropriate for smaller and medium sized cities. Furthermore the two EU-(co)funded information platforms / websites ELTIS and EPOMM provide hundreds of good practice examples that are a valuable contribution to AVTIVE TRAVEL NETWORK. ELTIS: European Local Transport Information Service: www.eltis.org 
EPOMM: European Platform on Mobility Management www.epomm.eu 
To guarantee European Added Value ATN has been set up in such a way that local action plans and its test implementations require a constant exchange process amongst partners. This exchange of best practice but also of barriers and how to overcome them will result in extended capacity building, supported by the joint training sessions during the lifetime of the project. Partners’ readiness to learn from each other will make their applications more effective. This experience will result in numerous case study examples that can be utilised all over Europe. Such information sharing cannot be achieved in isolated local, regional or national projects. Furthermore the cultural differences across Europe (which is often why a pure transfer of good practice examples from one country to another isn’t successful) will be highlighted. Based upon the findings from the MAX project (FP6 finalised 2009) these cultural dimensions will be tackled – which is only possible in an European project. Visibility of EU funded actions is of inherent value to the proposed activities, enabling it to reach a much broader target group. This will be achieved through collaboration with other complementary initiatives in the same thematic network and by closely linking the project to the network and know how transfer activities of EU-funded initiatives like ELTIS Motivation and baseline – objectives and approaches 
Why designing a project like ACTIVE TRAVEL NETWORK? Transport is the most frequent mentioned problem in municipalities and cities in Europe. There are thousands of small and medium sized cities and municipalities in Europe that have to solve their transport problems. Based upon the distances walking and cycling are appropriate and acceptable solutions (see EU Urban Action Plan, published in 2009 and other Policy Papers). The project combines different topics such as transport, environmental protection (CO2, noise, energy consumption etc.), health and social exclusion. Walking and cycling are the most cost-efficient means of transport. No big infrastructure costs occur (compared with building of roads, public transport or parking spaces). Walking and cycling can be done by almost everybody, by all citizen groups, even by social deprived groups. No special skills or vehicles are needed (besides a bicycle). Mobility management and travel awareness is an approach that cheap and easy to be implemented and could lead to big impacts Very promising for the project is the different initial situation, so to say the various motivations and reasons of partners to tackle the same problems ( = the overwhelming car traffic in their cities) and to participate in the project. The objectives and the approaches meet the requirements of very different cities and are therefore a good added value for other European cities and municipalities who face similar problems: The baseline situation of the German City of Norderstedt e.g. is the Noise Action Plan (the first one in Europe meeting the environmental noise directive (2002/49/EC) that includes cycling and walking as strategy to reduce the negative impacts of car traffic. In the Danish City of Skanderborg the Health department is the driving force as the Danish realised that lack of physical exercise will lead to severe health problems in the near future / of the next generation which will have much bigger impacts on the financing of public health in the future. For them the strengthening of walking and cycling as a contribution to transfer physical activity into every day’s routine of the citizens is a convincing cross-topic-approach. The positive impact of this approach on the transport system of the city, on the environment and on the quality of life is a welcomed side effect. The Greek City of Serres has its motivation based upon the fight against problems with limited space (e.g. parking or congestion). Since a lot of functions are concentrated in the city centre and at the same time the development of the city shows a diminution of public space and recreational areas such as parks and green areas due to land use planning policies in the last decades and also due to The Greek mentality to use the car even for shortest trips and to park wherever a small place is available (no matter if dedicated for parking or not) is even tightening the problem. The Romanian City of Sebes and the Polish city of Radzionkow are both quite small cities which face a very similar situation. In these cities, similar to hundreds of other ones in the New Member States, the car is playing a very dominant role regarding the social status. To have a car and to use a car increases the status of a person. While on the other side the use of bicycles and walking is seen as behind the times. This effects on a behaviour that even shortest trips are being done by car even when the parking search activity takes longer than the trip itself (and very often also longer than the trip done by bike). Accompanied is this “unhealthy” development by a lack of awareness regarding the negative impacts of extensive car use and a lack of push factors that usually regulate car use such as e.g. parking space management (time limited paid parking and enforcement). The Italian City of Riccione bases its activities on the problem to be solved during the touristic season due to a multiplication of (car) traffic on streets that were never planned for a car use of a population (and guests) that increases by about 5 times in summer. Since the economy of Riccione is fundamentally based on tourism and there is a hard national and international competition, Riccione must be more attractive via increasing its liveability and sustainability. This is the starting point to deal with cycling and walking as means of transport. For the Austrian City of Weiz environmental problems are one of the driving forces. For years the city already failed to meet the targets of the EU legislation regarding emissions, e.g. the PM10 limits. Since the car traffic is one of the main sources of PM10 emissions and since the failure of the limits will end up in a legal dispute with the EC the city needs to define policies and set up an action plan to reduce the car use. The frame conditions are quite good when taking into account the short distances that people driver their cars there and since the available infrastructure could be assessed as good for starting with motivation campaigns to change transport behaviour. In the Slovenian City of Ljutomer walking and cycling isn’t considered as equal modes of transport. Policies are completely lacking and when planning only infrastructure for car traffic is implemented. Financial support is mainly given to the building of roads. This ends up in a excessive car use which results in an immense safety problem for sustainable modes of transport, especially the most vulnerable groups like pedestrians and cyclists. The vicious cycle of more and more car use started. An accessory symptom of this vicious cycle is the lack of space in the city centre combined with bad access which leads to a transfer of shopping facilities from the centre to the outskirts of the city which are only accessible by car. The city administration has identified this problematic development and wants to start now a change of policy with the help of ACTIVE TRAVEL NETWORK. Lugo in Spain is an old Roman settlement with a strong and attractive city wall. The city is a UNESCO world cultural heritage and touristic attraction. Although the historical centre within the city walls is mainly car free and pedestrianised parts of the local economy (shop keepers, restaurants etc.) are still unhappy as they think that an access by car would increase their business (which is common for the whole of Europe). Since the car use is very comfortable in Lugo and the use of alternatives isn’t advertised (neither regarding advantages for the public space nor personal benefits) a lot of awareness raising is necessary to change this situation. Novara in Italy looks back to very successful previous projects like the LIFE III project RAVE which already prepared the ground for walking and cycling as means of transport. Now in a further step and having as objective the urban renewal in this stage it is crucial to introduce active mobility policies and actions such as new pedestrian and cycle paths joining the town centre and the renewed suburban areas, new satellite parking lots near the town centre, green areas and systems within the new residential areas and motivate people to change their behaviour. In times of economic crises all partner cities will face the problem of limited budget for transport solutions as well as all citizens will feel the raising costs for energy. The sooner cities and citizens are prepared for this new situation the better they will deal with it. The same is valid for the trend of an aging population in all European countries which will end in complete different needs. To keep the transport system in operation the frame conditions must be prepared already now so that access for everybody (not only car drivers) is guaranteed. Regarding infrastructure cycling and walking are low cost modes of transport compared with car traffic or public transport while their potential is enormous. Even when decreasing regarding the share the non motorised modes of transport (cycling and walking) still have a share of 30-50% in all partners cities (and in all similar cities in Europe) which never is reflective when having a look at the importance in transport / city planning or in the budget spent for these active travel modes.

"OP-ACT.
Options of actions for the strategic positioning of small and medium sized cities.

1. INTRODUCTION. 
At the beginning of the 21st century, the problem of shrinking cities is a widespread phenomenon in Europe. Due to demographic changes (ageing population, young families moving to metropolitan areas) economic regression and infrastructural as well as social struggles one of the most challenging tasks for small and medium sized cities is to create more attractive and worth living urban areas. 
1.1 Background. 
Demographic change, advanced de-industrialisation and the current financial crisis together with the linked danger of job losses pose specific challenges especially for those small and medium sized cities participating in this network. Most of them are struggling with declining and ageing population, declining working-age population and economic downturn. Less inhabitants and movement of enterprises as well as reduced funding allocations at regional and national level lead to declining revenues. Each partner city has already implemented some tools to overcome these new challenges but nevertheless exchange of experiences and best practices of other cities help to create new strategies. On a local level there are often not enough information and resources available to handle these upcoming challenges. The analysis of good and less successful attempts are the basis for the future cooperation of the OP-ACT project. The fact that sometimes shrinking and growing cities are geographically close to each other shows that the reaction of the city to specific conditions and needs is very important. This means that there is not ONE strategy in facing problems to be addressed, but that there has to be a very close look at the specific situation. The URBACT II Thematic Network OP-ACT partners have therefore come together to find new integrated and sustainable planning approaches to replace existing development and growth models. At the beginning of the 21st century, the shrinking cities phenomenon is widespread in Europe. To deal with the results of demographic, economic and physical contraction processes and to plan for the future of considerably smaller but nevertheless livable cities is one of the most challenging tasks for urban Europe in the near future. Demographic change is not in itself the problem, but the shrinking population figures and ageing of the inhabitants exert varying pressure on the individual policy fields. Economic development, labour market development, social and socio-demographic developments are just as significant. 
SHRINKING and AGEING POPULATION: 
According to different studies every 6th to 4th large city worldwide has lost population since the 1990s. The cities of Central and Southern Europe suffer the most from challenges with demographic adaptation whereas Northern and Western Europe have the least problems. Countries in green have either a slight increase in their population figures or just a minor decrease and they do have a relatively balanced age structure. Red countries however, struggle with a severe shrinking population and an imbalanced age structure. A shrinking city is defined as a densely populated urban area ; with a minimum population of 10,000 residents ; that has faced a population loss in large parts of it ; for more than 2 years ; is undergoing economic transformation with some symptoms of a structural crisis. 
In the 21st century, the historically unique epoch of growth that began with industrialization 200 years ago will come to an end. At the end of the 21st century, processes of urban shrinking and of growth will be in balance. 
- The number of people around the world who live in cities has grown 175- fold since 1800 – an incomparable process of growth. In the next 50 years, the number of urban residents will double again, but at the same time the processes of growth will come to an end. The UN predicts that the population of the world will stabilize and cease to grow at about 9 billion in around 2070. - Urbanization will be mostly complete; more than three-quarters of the world’s population will live in cities. - Until now, the essential causes of shrinking in developed countries have been Suburbanization (regional shifting of activities and people into the surroundings of the cities), Metropolitanization (countrywide shifting of activities and people to the great urban agglomerations), and Deindustrialization (the crisis of mono-industrially oriented sites). 
The concept of growth has dominated thinking in modern societies; shrinkage has been viewed as an accident and exception. In future, however, a culture of shrinkage is set to develop. - Shrinkage will in future be considered as normal a process of development as growth. It will lose its stigma and come to be seen as a scenario that has advantages as well as disadvantages and that leads to distinct forms of renewal and change. - There is a shift in terminology away from 'urban decay’ and 'urban decline’ towards 'shrinking cities’. In the 21st century, de-urbanization will increasingly affect suburbs and office districts. - In the future, the suburbs will lose population primarily because of total population loss and because of a partial withdrawal into the city centers. Increasing mobility costs and an aging population that has different mobility needs will contribute crucially to the processes of reconcentration. - The automation of office activities, the shift to home offices, offshoring, and the uncoupling of office work from office space by means of mobile, wireless equipment will tremendously reduce the need for the space of classical office complexes. 
Shrinking processes lead to dual societies: urban development, economic development, lifestyles, and much more differ fundamentally between the zones of growth and of shrinking. - In growing urban regions, the principle of the entrepreneurial city can develop remarkable dynamics of development; but shrinking regions are increasingly characterized by disinvestment – by capitalism without capital. - In shrinking regions, the classical economic elites of major companies and banks are replaced by local, often collectively organized micro-enterprises. - State and private-economy forms of governance and processes of development thereby differ fundamentally between zones of growth and of shrinking. We can thus even speak of two societies within one state. 
Urban planning and architecture in shrinking cities face new tasks - Post-architecture comprises the tasks arising when architecture – construction – is already present. What in conventional architectural practice is the result - is here the starting point. The issue here is how what already exists can be perceived, used, changed, or removed. - Pre-architecture, by contrast, is concerned with the things that precede an architectural practice and that make it possible in the first place. Among them are the production of desire, the imagination of possible new buildings, and the rousing of interest in realizing the latter. Speaking pragmatically, pre-architecture includes the formation of uses, construction clients, and funding. - The necessity to develop new “tools” of planning and building is comparable to the situation of Classical Modernism. The “New Construction” of the 1920s for example, would have been inconceivable without the development of an entire arsenal of new tools for the realization of urban planning and architecture. 
MIGRATION: The challenges that occur related to demographic change were already in the focus of the Third and Fourth Report on Economic and Social Cohesion. In the 3rd report it is predicted that the natural population growth is projected to fall further in the future and with similar rates of migration as in the past, population will begin to decline in most Member States over the next 20 years. As already mentioned above, Europe will be increasingly dependant on labour migration in the following years. Without labour migration, Europe is in danger of becoming commercially uncompetitive and regional disparities in the field of economy, infrastructure and social inclusion will increase. But Europe will only be able to compete with other immigration regions, if the EU offers sufficient opportunities for inclusion and integration of the immigrants. This integration occurs primarily via the labour market and through adequate social systems, but depends also on to which degree cultural and other needs are met. 
SOCIAL CHALLENGES: Challenges for the cities / countries that suffer from demographic change occur also through social disparities, e.g. labour market tendencies and related to it, inequalities in income and therefore also an increase in the poverty rate. The labour market has developed positively in Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia, Bulgaria, Italy and Greece during the years 2000 to 2005, but negatively in Portugal, Sweden, Germany and Poland. It becomes also more and more apparent that the percentage of part-time employment and of fixed-term employment rises significantly, from 16% of the total employment in 1995 to 19.4% in 2005 for the part-time and from 12% in 1995 to 14.3% in 2005 for the fix-term employment. It is also obvious that more and more people have to work in more than one jobs to keep their living standard and don’t risk poverty. The groups that are most vulnerable to fall into the poverty trap are long-term unemployed, farmers, never employed and immigrants from non-EU countries. Countries with a high risk of poverty are Ireland, Poland, Denmark and Sweden whereas the risk in Cyprus, Hungary, Slovenia, The Netherlands and Luxembourg is quite low. Effective systems for socially disadvantaged persons can be found in Denmark, Sweden, Finland and Poland, whereas the social systems in Bulgaria, Greece, Italy, Romania and Cyprus are rather ineffective. Furthermore in countries, such as e. g. Germany, Portugal, Italy and Lithuania the tendencies for unequal income distribution increase whereas other countries, such as e. g. Spain, Belgium, Estonia and Latvia are already trying to close the income gap.    
4. SYNTHESIS. 
4.1 General analysis.
At the beginning of the 21st century, the phenomenon of shrinking cities is widespread in Europe. One in every six cities worldwide has declined in population since the 1990s. The initial situation in most of the project partners is or has been similar. Due to structural changes in the economic background in combination with decreasing (or static) populations, the financial basis of the cities is or was at risk. Straightened by the current economic crisis there is a negative spiral caused by diminishing tax incomes and lower shares in financial compensation provided by regional and national levels. An increasing need for action is accompanied by lessening financial means. The adaptation process to these changing conditions is at a different stage in each city. Each project partner has tried to build up new strategies based on their own combination of local resources. Several of them stressed the fact that 'shrinking' can turn the atmosphere of a city into a dynamic situation as the population decline forces cities (and citizens) to be creative and to accept change. This view can also be an impetus to attract young people and young families, creative businesses and so on. and also to enhance innovative citizen participation models (e.g. the pedestrian zone was paved by Altena citizens; public participation processes have been so intensive that the municipality is already considering (a) diminishing marginal utility of these processes in fulfilling municipal tasks). Nevertheless the partners currently have to counteract several challenges which occur as a consequence of demographic change and shrinking. These problems are often linked to each other and comprise a vicious circle. Most of the cities mentioned not only decline in the numbers of citizens but also 'greying' in the residents who remain. Due to the fact that labour market opportunities are limited or have decreased, persons of working age leave and seek jobs in larger cities. Especially highly-skilled persons are the first to find work somewhere else. Thus the elderly and the untrained stay in the city. Often the skills and knowledge of the work force do not correspond to local economy requirements. An adequate training programme which has been worked out with education facilities and companies could be one solution. In many cities the economy is based on mono-commercial structures and depends on just a few traditional 'old' industries as employers. Because of the recent crisis some of these main employers had to close and no other businesses were able to offer adequate employment. Not only economic diversification is therefore needed in partner cities but it is also necessary to motivate young or unemployed persons to start their own businesses. In this context the question of keeping a city centre attractive and unique through smaller, individually-l owned shops could be a field of activity OP-ACT. Altena, for example, is considering a concept of attracting art or culture-oriented shops and businesses to the city centre. Some historic buildings are planned or considered to be turned into hotels and event or conference centres. A further effect of the diminished number of businesses in a city is of course also cut-backs in income and consequent financial constraints. Several partners mentioned having to rank in importance new infrastructural or social projects because of reduced financial means. Elaborated strategic plans have had to be abandoned because there is no - or less - money to implement the measures defined. Additionally, cities often have to counter a bad image that they not only have from outsiders but also the fact that their own residents do not have a very good opinion of their city. Especially in parts of cities inhabited largely by disadvantaged groups or immigrants, commitment to and identification with their city is not very high. In these cases, it was/is possible to redefine citizens' (locals' and immigrants') perceptions of deprived neighbourhoods through organising cultural and educational activities and actively involving these residents. An important issue in this context is also the question as to whether immigration is really an instrument in mitigating shrinking populations. The advantages of cities that are part of an agglomeration, namely better access through efficient transport and mobility systems, advanced cultural facilities within reasonable distance, comparatively cheap land prices, etc. are often not realised by citizens and authorities. On the contrary, being part of a region is often seen as an issue based on competition than on synergy effects. Finding methods to communicate these advantages and use them for further development will also be one aim of the OP-ACT project. Another field of attention for OP-ACT is related to use and structures of residential buildings and land property in times of population decline and ageing. The basis for solutions to the partner cities' challenges lies in the potential and location advantages that each one of them possesses. There are many 'diamonds' in each city that just need to be polished and promoted. They are, for example:juniversities / higher educational institutions   cultural heritage and cultural activities   tourist attractions   landscape   active citizens Ways have to be found within the network for better use of the potential in order to attract new businesses and residents. 
4.2 Work structure and methodology. 
Work structure: 
In accordance with the main themes mentioned above, the following work structure has been jointly defined by all project partners. The results and outputs of these four work packages may help to provide recommendations to our and other cities affected by demographic change and shrinking. The first, more strategic, work package, which is cross-cutting over the other three, concentrates on governance and new narratives and comprises the following topics: administrative structures, branding, finances, cooperation and communication. It is obvious that these issues are the basis for the other three, more operational work packages. Main questions within this work package include:qways to adapt to being smaller than in the past (e.g. administrative structure, budgets etc.)   turning the fact that a city is shrinking into an advantage   what strategic links between different policies and departments in public administration bodies make sense? (e.g. cooperation between health care and educational departments)   for what aspects of urban development is cooperation between a city and its hinterland / region useful? (e.g. regional marketing, etc.)   what is successful branding and marketing in a city? (e.g. internal and external image-building, promotion of certain aspects, etc.)   is public (citizens’) participation reasonable for city development? What participation processes are/have been successful?   what new financial strategies are needed for shrinking cities? The contents of the second work package, social and economic inclusion, can be summarised under the following issues: immigration, social groups, labour market needs, education, new businesses. The main points that are to be clarified include:  can migration function as a strategy for stabilisation?  how can active inclusion of immigrants, socially disadvantaged groups and unemployed persons into social life be achieved?  What ways are there to bridge generations and actively include young and elderly people in social life?  what training is best to get skilled workers as needed into the labour market? How can companies cooperate with education facilities? what needs to be done to attract new businesses?  what methods exist to stabilise the local economy and achieve diversification of businesses? The third work package deals with city living conditions which focus on the main topics of facilities, attractiveness of neighbourhoods and housing, and addresses the following main questions:  how can disadvantaged and degraded neighbourhoods be revitalised and upgraded?  What methods are successful in enhancing the quality of life? (social and cultural infrastructure, environment, etc.)  What methods and instruments are needed for sustainable urban renewal?  ow can attractive housing and improvement in living conditions be realised in times of limited finances?  ow can living and social conditions in small and medium sized cities be communicated as an advantage? And finally the fourth work package covers the topic of location advantages and the main issues of education, tourism, culture and trade. The focus lies here on answers to the following questions: how can the advantage of having educational institutions (university, higher educational facilities, etc.) in the city be better promoted?  ow can tourism strategy be developed in order to market the whole region as a tourist destination but keeping the individuality of each city? What cooperation is needed?  ow can awareness be raised for the advantages of living conditions in small and medium sized cities? (e.g. reduced commuting, compact city, etc.) What attributes distinguish the city from other cities?  re cultural activities and cultural centres instruments for better inclusion and attractiveness in a city? What opportunities exist to distinguish a city from surrounding cities in the fields of business and commerce? (e.g. shopping attractions, exclusive shopping, combination of art and business, etc.)

"OPENCities.
Openness and the Competitive Advantage of Diversity.

1. Introduction.
 Belfast City Council, together with a number of partners in a network of European cities were successful in securing access to funding from the URBACT II programme for the development and operation of a Thematic Network (TN) of cities to exchange ideas on policy and best practice. The OPENCities partnership starting point was a draft definition developed by the British Council (Towards OPENCities). The cities committed to take forward this project want to identify what makes a city open and attractive to economic migrants – essentially how do we define Openness – what is an Open City ? – and how can cities develop more pro-active policies to create open cities to better attract or retain mobile international populations, which are important to both the competitive and convergence objectives of the European Union. The funding allocated by the European Commission for the OPENCities project financed a series of activities over an initial DEVELOPMENT Phase which started in April 2008 and which finished leading into a 30 month IMPLEMENTATION Phase. OPENCities was selected as a “Fast Track” project by the European Commission which ensures that Commission will work closely with the partner cities to share information and exploit opportunities for pilot projects, ensuring active engagement with the national Managing Authorities for European Structural Funds and taking the views and opinions of Local Support Groups (LSGs) on board. The partners in the OPENCities project include a mix of cities from competitiveness and convergence regions of Europe which bring different perspectives to the OPENCities concept and the mobility of economic migrants, given that in some cases partner cities are net recipients of inflows of migrants and in others (at least in the short-term) have witnessed net outflows of national population to take full advantage of economic opportunities within the European Union. 
1. The European Context.
Cities are increasingly the poles for growth, enterprise, innovation and technology and equally must balance the problems which can arise in failing to plan for and proactively address the issues associated with social inclusion and economic diversity. Making European Cities more attractive and giving them the flexibility to pick up on the drivers for economic growth and to react to the increased pressures of globalization – we argue is increasingly linked to effective urban and population planning strategies. The project is consistent with the EU Cohesion Strategic Priorities, which recognize the importance of cities in terms of growth and creation of jobs. The partner cities will work through the exchange of best practice, peer reviews and workshops to address issues related to the social and economic integration of migrant groups, addressing barriers to labour market entry and education, sharing experience on providing social assistance measures and considering the measures which improve the potential for increasing business-starts amongst the immigrant communities. Cities have a vital role to play in the achievement of the Lisbon and Gothenburg strategy aims. The URBACT II programme will facilitate this task by allowing cities to exchange experience on key urban policy fields to help improve the effectiveness of sustainable integrated urban development policies in Europe. The URBACT II programme is focused on bringing together actors at local and regional level to exchange ideas and learn from each other on a wide range of urban policy themes with the focus on achieving the main objective of improving the effectiveness and impact of such policies at urban level. Most EU cities have policies in place which aim to meet the challenges linked to urban sustainable development. However not all policies turn out to be effective in solving problems faced by cities so far, hence the need to exchange experience and learn from good practice in these fields. On 8 November 2006 the European Commission adopted a new initiative for the 2007-2013 programming period under the Territorial Cooperation objective called ""Regions for Economic Change"" (REC). It introduces new ways to interface with regional and urban networks and to help them work closely with the Commission, to have innovative ideas tested and rapidly disseminated into the Convergence, Regional Competitiveness and Employment, and European Territorial cooperation programmes. Under the REC initiative the European Commission created the “fast track” option to allow it to track and provide particular focused support to innovative initiatives. OPENCities has been selected as fast track project under REC and located within the priority theme of Managing Migration which is contained in REC. In the course of a European Commission Regions for Economic Change workshop in January 2007 on “Regional Challenges to Demographic Challenges”, it was noted that migration was a particularly important issue for larger cities which tended to attract more workers. It was argued that without international migration there would be unsustainable demographic changes in the economic fabric of many European cities and regions. It was further mentioned that many cities depend on migrant workers to address skills shortages and other demographic issues and in the future they would have to develop strategies to attract or retain skilled workers. Our contention is that this points to a future trend where cities and city regions would be competing across the EU and beyond to attract inward migrants or avoid losing their skilled workers. The key issues for the OPENCities project is to consider these trends, to better understand the motivations which lead to the movement of migrant groups, to define the key indicators which constitute OPENCities and develop a framework for measuring openness in OPENCities which will help city leaders to develop wider city marketing strategies to contribute to internationalization agendas. According to the European Commission their view is that cities are places where social disparities, migrant populations and ethnic minorities tend to be concentrated. Efforts should be made to exploit the huge potential of this cultural and social diversity. Cities and regions working on this theme will aim to strengthen their integration by providing these groups with access to job opportunities through education, training, microcredits, improved infrastructure and advisory services. 
2.Objectives and Challenges.
The European Union continues to enjoy major population shifts in terms of the movement of international talent and economic migrants across the member states – on the one hand some countries have continued to witness significant positive inflows and some of the new member states have had to cope with steady outward flows. Previous patterns of immigration have been reversed with countries like Ireland and Spain experiencing population growth due to economic growth and open-ness to international populations. There are large variations in migration flows in terms of size and origin between the Member States, reflecting traditional patterns of migration and cultural and geographical ties. Some cities and regions are coping with the challenges of immigration and integration for the first time, like Belfast and Dublin, whereas others have developed approaches and innovative solutions for decades like Vienna, Madrid, Dusseldorf. Richard Florida, the author of the book “The rise of the creative class”, which became one of the most discussed and influential works for urban planners, suggests that economic prosperity is tied to tolerance and openness to diversity. According to him places are tolerant and open if they have “low barriers of entry for individuals”. These places are open for new people and ideas and therefore they will show a higher concentration of talent and higher rates of innovation. Openness to the outside world is central to the debate about economic growth. Economists have looked at openness mainly in terms of exports and imports of goods as well as capital flows. The increasing importance of human capital and the knowledge-based economy suggests that it is also essential to be open to people and the constant ebb and flow of economic migration – the attraction, retention and return of migrant workers. According to a recent report produced by EUROCities (2008) “Role of Cities in Managing Economic Migration”, economic migration can be a difficult concept to fully define – clearly it is primarily about the relocation of migrants (usually migrant workers rather than asylum seekers) for a period or more than one year and for the most part, even though it involves challenges related to social integration, it is focused more on relocation for some economic gain which can clearly benefit the individual and the host economy. The OPENCities project focuses on the contribution of international populations (economic migrants) to a cities’ success: International populations are seen as contributors to the labour force. More importantly, they should increase local quality of life and the attractiveness of the place for international events, investors and visitors. Via different channels internationalisation and the resulting human diversity is a spur to economic success of the cities. Cities who intend to be attractive for international populations should be “open”. Openness is therefore defined as “the quality and sum of the local conditions that attract and retain international populations over time”.  
OPENCities Main Objective.  
To identify what makes a city attractive to international populations and to develop practical strategies tackling economic and social integration issues, which can help cities better attract and retain international populations, thus contributing to their improved competitiveness. In preparation of the baseline report with the partner cities, it became clear that there are two different sides to the equation in terms of the flow of migration between competitiveness and convergence regions. The competitiveness cities continue to be interested in attracting international population to support ongoing economic development (although with some recent changes in the aftermath of the global credit crunch). Some of the convergence cities are more concerned at this stage with attraction/ return or retention of their own population although they have begun to see increased international mobility. The core questions, however remain valid to both groups of cities what attracts international populations to a place? The expectations and aspirations of international populations vary depending on country of origin, reason of migration/visit, age, sex, family status, profession and line of business. It is therefore necessary that the cities’ openness is measured as comprehensively as possible, e.g. including a wide range of indicators and taking into account the different views of the core issues. Good economic conditions are important in order to attract and retrain human capital. They are necessary to grant economic migrants a certain standard of living. It is also necessary to offer firms an attractive business environment. Migrants contribute as workers, employees, entrepreneurs or investors to the economic success of the city. They can, however, only contribute fully to the economic performance of the city if they are integrated in the economy of the place. Poor labour market integration among immigrants, for example, can lead to tensions between native born and immigrants because unemployed immigrations need public benefits. Integration in this field is therefore vital to build an open and tolerant place in the long term. Equally many of the measures undertaken by cities to address the social aspects of integration are equally important to new arrivals in terms of sense of belonging and security. Efforts to support cultural and social integration of newcomers are increasingly important across European Cities and the challenges for a project like OPENCities is to better understand the motivations and the appropriate mix of social and economic factors which add value to the integration process. The OPENCities network proposes to organize their exchange of best practice through a series of workshops and peer review exercises around the following themes :  LEADERSHIP and GOVERNANCE : understanding what contribution effective leadership makes to helping to create a more OPENCity and what factors leaders need to manage to create OPENCities.  INTERNATIONALISATION : to consider what are the benefits of a city having an international population looking at examples of successful cities where having a diverse international population has made a positive contribution.  INTEGRATION AND INCLUSION : to better understand what measures do cities have in place to support the integration/inclusion of economic migrants and to what extent do integration and inclusion factors in cities impact upon their attractiveness and openness to international populations. What is the link between integration and openness ? Main Issues and Challenges for OPENCities The project will tackle the following main issues on the basis that not all cities are equally open to international migrants, we want to better understand : What is city open-ness and how to define what makes OPENCities - considering number of factors – economic, regulatory, cultural, amenity, connectivity, risks, leadership and internationalisation ? How can we better define and measure these factors? How do they affect one another? Why do some cities appear to be more attractive to international populations despite similar national frameworks and conditions? Can cities take effective actions locally to make themselves more open to international populations? What will make such local actions successful? What are the different starting points of selected cities within the EU in terms of City types, economic structure, immigration history, location, stage of development and how do these affect the attractiveness of the cities for international populations? What role does the social and economic integration of migrants play in city competitiveness and the attraction of further international human capital? For example, does an integrated city offer a more attractive environment for higher skilled international knowledge worker? Does an integrated city make better use of its existing human capital? How do different groups of international workers respond to different factors of openness? For example, are international workers in different age and income groups, in different economic sectors, or from different parts of the world, sensitive to different local factors? What measures and programmes do various European cities have in place in terms of local population attraction strategies, international promotion, settlement services, employment, education, and enterprise to facilitate the attraction and retention of international populations. ? Can we explore the opportunity through exchange of best practice, peer reviews and development of case studies to develop and test the use of local action plans and strategies to attract international populations? viii. Can we develop clear guidance for city leaders on how to increase and promote the openness of cities to international populations? Can we develop an OPENCities ‘index’/framework to compare and benchmark various European cities and to consider the potential for an internationally recognised openness ‘standard’ or ‘kitemark’ for cities? Given that cities across the EU have different powers, competences, and fiscal systems, how can cities both manage their own open-ness and best influence other local, regional, and national bodies to help make cities and the EU more open to international talent? What leadership role can cities play? Clearly there a number of factors and indicators which come together to frame the OPENCities concept. During the implementation phase of the project the partner cities will review and analyse the information from the OPENCities project to help develop Local Action Plans – which link into city marketing and internationalisation strategies linked to the attraction of economic migrants and to develop pilot projects with European Structural Funds to mainstream best practice in supporting economic and social inclusion. The cities participating in this project represent EU member states from across the European territory and countries which have adopted more or less open approaches to tackling the integration of migrant communities. URBACT II offers the opportunity to exchange ideas, to learn from best practice and in the case of the new member states to plan ahead for the future.

"Placemaking for Cities.

Placemaking connects communities, engenders public debate, promotes social inclusion and enhances the quality of life. The growing interest in placemaking as a social process calls for new approaches to urban design, planning and governance. This is why the Placemaking for Cities (P4C) network has come together. We want to enhance our capabilities to create places that communities value. P4C focuses on the engagement of communities and the empowerment of citizens to take the lead in the placemaking process. 
Placemaking is as a process which draws on the ideas, resources and commitment of a local community to create places that they value. Once started, placemaking is an on-going process through which a community creates and develops the spaces where people pursue their business, recreational and social interests in a self- determined way. All too often places are created which do not attract people and new skills which develop and empower local communities have to be learned, procedures and regulations which control public spaces have to be modernised and the norms, values and assumptions which make our urban spaces what they are need to be challenged. 
The P4C network has come together to learn about placemaking. This will include two steps. The first step is to study contemporary approaches to placemaking in Dun Laoghaire Rathdown County where community led approaches towards placemaking have been practiced for a long time. 
The transfer of these practices to three different cities and three different countries forms the main 
element of the P4C pilot. The partners who will aim to transfer good practices are Albacete in Spain, Eger in Hungary and Pori in Finland. 
These partners operate in very contrasting institutional and cultural contexts which represents a challenge but also a strength of this pilot project. If the good practices can be adapted and transferred between these very different locations then the P4C approach should facilitate good practice transfer across other countries and certainly support good practice transfer within national borders. 
This is particularly relevant with regard to new EU policies which make Community Led Local Development (CLLD) the unifying principle for the five funding programmes within the Common Strategic Framework. 
Exploring the practice collaborative placemaking as proposed by P4C offers an excellent opportunity to inform emerging CLLD policy on integrated urban regeneration and also to share the learning from this pilot with the cities of the URBACT community. 
However, much of what represents good practice is based on the past and at times learning about past examples seems less important than dealing with pressing contemporary problems. Hence the P4C project has included the development of a current placemaking project by the providing city Dun Laoghaire. This will run in parallel to the transfer process and is intended to allow participating cities to observe and explore in real time the problems that have to be tackled even by a city that has a long track record of successful collaborative placemaking.

What do we mean by placemaking ? 
Try to tweet or google „placemaking‟ and you will be surprised, thousands of people are interested in placemaking! The twitter site for our network #p4c.urbact attracted hundreds of followers within a few weeks from being launched. However, a cursory review of our followers shows that they have a wide range of diverging interests because there are as many different ways of defining placemaking as there are placemaking projects. 
We can describe placemaking as a process which draws on the ideas, resources and commitment of a local community to create places that they value. Once started, placemaking is an on-going process through which a community creates and develops the spaces where people pursue their business, recreational and social interests in a self- determined way. 
The Project for Public Places pioneered the concept of placemaking and has a wealth of experience in applying the tools and resources that are available free of charge on their website (www.pps.org). They define placemaking as follows: 
“Placemaking is a multi-faceted approach to the planning, design and management of public spaces. Put simply, it involves looking at, listening to, and asking questions of the people who live, work and play in a particular space to discover their ideas and aspirations. This information is then used to create a common vision for that place. The vision can evolve quickly into an implementation strategy, beginning with small-scale, doable improvements that can immediately bring benefits to public spaces and the people who use them.” 
Placemaking can involve everything, from landscaping to festivals, from playgrounds to restaurants, from retrofitting empty properties to painting murals on buildings. The important thing is that the local community is „making‟ their places.

Placemaking has a strong emphasis on enabling local communities to shape the places they use. Hence placemaking is often seen as the opposite to the institutionalised design of urban spaces. Advocates of the bottom-up approach see placemaking as a response to the planning failures of the past which have created hostile and unsustainable urban environments. Good planning and design, on the other hand, are considered by many practitioners as essential elements of the placemaking process.

Different perspectives on placemaking. 
Urban spaces have long been of interest to sociologists and planners. Pioneers like William „Holly‟ Whyte (The Social Life of Small Urban Spaces, 1980)  and Jane Jacobs (Death and Life of Great American Cities, 1961) are among the most influential writers and practitioners who founded the idea of placemaking by bringing together the study of human behaviour with a critical analysis of the design of the public realm.
One of the most important contemporary thinkers and practitioners on placemaking in Europe is Professor Jan Gehl, Director of the Centre for Public Space Research in Copenhagen. His seminal books and ground breaking designs make convincing arguments about the importance of high quality streets, squares, parks and other public spaces for strengthening civil society.
Jan Gehl places much emphasis on place analysis and the consultation of place users, but ultimately for him it is the quality of the design which determines whether a space becomes a focus for social interaction or stays empty and devoid of people. He is speaking on behalf of many professionals, such as the former chief planner and urbanist of Vancouver, Brent Toderian, who created the unique urban environments along Vancouver‟s water fronts which won many prestigious awards.
Attractive places are sustainable places. 
The theory of placemaking suggests that an attractive place is a sustainable place. In order to be attractive some experts argue that there need to be at least 10 different things that make a place interesting. This might include a place‟s history, it‟s shops, the people who go there, the things one can do in the place and so forth. Placemaking achieves or deals with a range of issues at the same time. At the most basic level placemaking builds or improves a public place, generates public debate, creates social contacts, engenders civic pride, supports economic development and enhance the quality of life in the community. 
Placemaking concepts draw on well established ideas around good practice in community engagement and development, urban planning, landscape design, economic development and governance. However, there is a clear and uncompromising focus on the public space. Rather than being a by-product of transport, housing or retail developments, the public space is the main focus. Placemaking starts with the public space and then integrates issues that are related to a particular place. 
Placemaking is very much about the process of „making‟ the place, collectively and in ways which develop and celebrate a sense of community. 
Most models which try to capture what is involved in the creation of a „good place‟ show that there is an important relationships between the tangible and intangible aspects of a space. The diagram below is a well established, if rather complex model which tries to capture the key dimensions of a place. It was developed by the Project for Public Spaces to help local communities undertake a structured evaluation of their public spaces.
Placemaking is an inclusive process. 
This brief overview of the main perspectives on placemaking shows that local people play a central role in the planning and design of public spaces. Being community led is the key principle of placemaking because this mitigates against citizens being „given‟ improvements they do not value and enables them to take more responsibility for their local community. 
We will now present different ways of placemaking. In most cases placemaking is the result of collaboration between public agencies, citizens and business. But at times placemaking is an expression of protest against the way urban spaces are controlled or designed. The selection of examples on the creation, interim use and animation of spaces provided here is by necessity limited and cannot possibly claim to encompass the array of placemaking actions that are going on around the world. We have therefore focused on examples that are likely to be of relevance to the P4C network. 
Creating new places. 
Many urban environments offer opportunities for local people to take over spaces, at least temporarily. In high density urban areas residents often try to create safe and green areas by reducing the space given over to cars for example. The case study of the Guerro Park in San Franscisco shows that the municipality led initiative „Pavement to Parks‟ initiative can link up with the aspirations of residents to create safer and more socially valuable spaces in their neighbourhoods. But it also shows the limitations of resident led improvements in such busy and high density urban spaces: significant capital expenditure from the municipality is necessary to make the improvements sustainable. This is one of the reasons why municipality often resist such placemaking attempts by their citizens.
In less central urban areas, and in particular in declining or shrinking cities, there is often a surplus of space. Current experiments with managing surplus or underused land by the International Building Exhibition in Saxony-Anhalt in Germany contain many examples where residents are given opportunities and resources to create gardens to grow food, keep animals or create urban forests. While a growing number of European cities which suffer from prolonged shrinkage would benefit from innovations in the utilisation of spaces the city most famous for its dramatic decline and experiments in space usage is Detroit. This once mighty „motor city‟ has been the grip of a spiral of decline which has resulted in vast tracts of land being abandoned. Here large scale urban farming projects are being initiated by local residents who intend to create a new and more sustainable future for themselves. Compared to cities like San Franscisco the investment of public agencies is minimal and successful projects rely entirely on the input from residents and local entrepreneurs.
Not all urban gardening projects are on such a large scale or in declining urban areas. The lead partner of the P4C network, Dun Laoghaire Rathdown County Council, has developed an urban garden in a housing estate which is now considered an example of best practice. Starting out as a piece of wasteland that attracted fly tipping, fires, joyriders, drug and alcohol abuse right behind the gardens of the local residents. This space is now a thriving and entirely self-sustaining community garden. The P4C good practice exchange will in part focus on the Shanganagh Community Garden because it illustrates how public agencies can work with local people in ways which empower them to create and manage new social space.
Giving local people the power to make decisions and to take responsibility for their places has been very successful in DLR. Not only has the garden doubled in size within three years, the municipality is adopting the principle of community gardens into the strategic planning and policy framework for the city. The gardening idea has caught on in the region as well - there is now a Community Growers Network and Shanganagh Community Garden is one of the good practice examples in this network as well 
Interim use of spaces. 
Not all spaces are created with the intention of making improvements permanent. The financial crisis has created many unfinished developments in Europe and nowhere is this problem more prevalent than in Ireland. Here the boom and bust of the property market was so severe that a national agency was established to manage to completion, demolition or mothballing of „ghost‟ developments. These are new built projects where the developer has gone into liquidation and where there is no prospective buyer or indeed user. The picture below shows an example of a mixed-use city centre development which is expected to remain unfinished for years to come. The architects created a tremporary footpath through the site and gave local youngsters scope to enhance the appearance of the security fence.
Pop-up shops are another way of creating places. As retailers on high streets and in town centres struggle to sustain their business the number of premises that are vacant has reached alarming levels in many European cities. One way of utilising these spaces is to make them available to local entrepreneurs at low or no cost to enable them to set up short-term restaurants, bars, shops, galleries, libraries or music venues. In the UK and elsewhere we find well organised networks which support people who want to set up a pop-up.
Berlin‟s cultural quarter in Wedding is a well known example of interim uses of surplus industrial and public buildings. The municipality facilitated access and tenancy agreements for artists who have set up workshops, galleries and night clubs, such as the club in the cellars of the former public baths in Wedding.
Conflicts of interest. 
Interim uses of urban structures rely on the owners to permit new uses at a low or no cost. The trade off between generating revenue and accommodating users that cannot pay commercial rents is that spaces do not become abandoned. The 1980s have taught us a lasting lesson on the „broken windows syndrome‟ and city planners are anxious to counteract a spiral of vanadlism and decline. The Wächterhäuser in Germany‟s shrinking cities are a good example of applying this principle to residential property. 
However, interim uses tend to come to end when investors see opportunities to make a profit. This is the case in Wedding where much of what has been created by local entrepreneurs and artists is being taken away by property developers who want to take advantage of the bohemian atmosphere of the quarter. A similar process is underway on the central airfield in Berlin Tempelhof where interim uses of land and buildings will come to an end once the planned housing development gets underway. The example of Berlin is replicated across Europe – one the one hand municipalities want to utilise redundant structures and surplus land, on the other they struggle to resist economic pressures which promise investment and jobs.
A current example of how interim uses can become highly contested is the Southbank Centre in London. Skateboard enthusiasts have used the basement of the centre as a skate park for 40 years. This place has assumed iconic status for skateboarders from around the world but under current re-development plans for the South Bank centre this place would be used for commercial purposes. An international coalition to save the skatepark was quickly established and a petition with 60,000 signatures was submitted to teh Mayor of London recently, opposing the proposed re-location of the skatepark to a purpose built facility. 
The Southbank skatepark example illustrates that municipalities cannot simply decide what trade-offs or compromises they can make with users who have adopted a place. Commercial interests are relatively powerful and tend to get their way when they are in conflict the interests of residents. Volumes of planning legislation are witness to the complexity of these conflicts of interest. 
Planning regulations, however, are often the source of much conflict – even when the procedures were followed accurately by the authorities. The picture below shows residents of Burgos, Spain, protesting against the removal of their green boulevard to make space for the new tram system.
The placemaking philosophy, however, is based on collaboration and not regulation to solve conflicts of interest. The animation of public spaces is an important method to create a sense of shared ownership and allows people who might not always agree to come together to celebrate their places. 
Animating public places. 
Urban public spaces offer the opportunity for people to come together and share experiences, hence the animation of squares and streets in our cities is as old and well established as the cities themselves. There are of course amazing and high profile festivals and events which grab the headlines, for example celebrations to mark the beginning of the New Year or cultural festivals celebrating music, theatre or religious and historic events. But high profile events do not have to be expensive as the most recent invention of a placemaking action in Trafalgar Square in London and 160 other cities demonstrates. 
Sport events in public spaces are also well tested temporary and low cost animations. Most countries have a high profile event, such as the London marathon which attracts people from all over the country and even abroad. But small cities can and do organise their own sporting events in public places. For example, Dun Laoghaire is now in its fourth year of organising the annual 5K Fun Run. When it started in 2010 there were just 100 participants, now there are over 1,000. Each participant pays €5 to cover the costs of the event and in return gets a T-Shirt. Today the park which hosts the run is used by many locals for their daily run - most of them wearing the Fun Run T-shirts they obtained. 
There are enduring and very low-cost ways of encouraging people to use public places in an active way as well as daring, innovative ways of using public spaces. The six hour closure of a German motorway in the Ruhrgebiet as part of the celebrations of the German city of culture attracted thousands of visitors. IN addition it served its purpose in raising the profile of a declining industrial area struggling to develop an new perspective for its future development.
Furnishing public places. 
Creating events in which people from all age groups can participate is an important dimension of placemaking. Creating the right atmosphere is equally important. There are many examples of urban places that are uninviting or even hostile to human interaction. By choosing the right furniture social interaction and even physical activities can be encouraged.
There is also a growing range of innovative street furniture available which facilitate social interaction. These benches from Jeppe Hein illustrate what can be done.
Enterprise in public places. 
One of the reasons why municipalities are eager to design attractive places is because they are good for business. Iconic cities have iconic squares, think of Siena, Rome or Paris – cities where there is a dazzling choice of different places to do different 
things. Most cities do not have such advantages and must confine themselves to enhance a small numbers places in their town centres. 
Markets used to be a regular feature in our towns and cities but they have all but disappeared. Specialist fares such as vintage cars or farmers markets are making a comeback and it would seem that in some areas they remain an attractive way of utilising public places for business purposes. In recent years there has been a surge in street parties which often tend to serve multiple purposes. They allow local communities to come together to celebrate an event or a particular achievement, and at the same time create an opportunity to generate income for good causes. The UK has an impressive track record of raising money for charitable causes through street markets and fun fairs.
The P4C approach to placemaking. 
The P4C network consists of partner cities which have worked together before. During the URBACT sponsored SURE project, which ran from 2011 – 2013, we explored issues of inclusive and integrated regeneration of neighbourhoods. One of the topics we worked on was placemaking and we did this in the Belgium city Louvain-la-Neuve.
What the work on the SURE project demonstrated was that an easily understood concept, such as placemaking, might be coherent and very practical but that its translation into appropriate actions can be fraught with difficulty. We learned that regulations, institutional frameworks, attitudes and cultural differences all contribute to the creation of barriers which stand in the way of improving public spaces – let alone transferring good practice from one city to another. 
In developing this pilot project the P4C network decided that it would not follow any particular school of thought on the placemaking process. We share the PPS perspectives which hold that placemaking must be a bottom-up process. Here experts and institutions provide resources and support the implementation of ideas developed by communities. Placemaking is perceived as a series of experiments based on flexible solutions which are created and sustained by local stakeholders. The 
top-down or expert led approach is equally relevant to P4C. We consider that municipalities, architects, urbanists and planners all have an important role to play in creating the context in which successful places can develop. We believe that there is a continuum of placemaking approaches ranging from expert-led to community-led initiatives. 
Placemaking can start as an expert-led initiative and become a self-sustaining community-led project as the case of Shanganagh Community Garden demonstrates. However, the skills required to facilitate the engagement and empowerment of communities are often not found in the institutions who have the powers to control and regulate the process that result in the places we see in our towns and cities. Drivers which determine the way in which an urban space can be developed include planning and regulatory structures, property ownership, the strategic decision making processes, as well as values which guide planning, design and economic development in a city. 
While improvements to urban places are often perceived as a linear process, predictable and controlled, the P4C perspective on placemaking is that of a „messy‟ process. The outcomes are not easily predicted and the process is characterised by stoppages, de-tours, delays, repetitions and mistakes. Resolving conflicts of interests are also a central part of the placemaking process. The P4C approach is aimed at developing capacity of the local community with its residents, businesses and visitors as well as the officers and politicians who run municipalities to create collaborative placemaking processes. 
Our perspective on the reality of placemaking is captured in the diagram below. The rate at which communities develop their capacity cannot easily be planned for and requires a non-linear approach. At the same time there are institutional drivers which require a more linear approach, especially where planning approvals, budgetary negotiations, funding applications and contracting processes are involved.
P4C acknowledges that both are necessary but neither approach should automatically be given preference. Nevertheless, where municipalities desire that citizens take a stronger ownership of their places, then enhancing social capital and community infrastructure must have clear priority. The implication of this is that institutions which are accustomed (and often required) to demonstrate control have to become more flexible and accommodating of risk and ambiguity in their approach to placemaking.
However, public institutions are designed to reduce risks, create predictable outcomes and authorised actions, hence they are ill prepared to support non-linear and unpredicatbale processes. The P4C network therefore aims to understand how such capabilities can be developed in their own organisations and networks. In Chapter 3 we explain our methodological and evaluative framework to assess the process and impact of the transfer. But first present details of the P4C cities and their exchange projects.

"PREVENT network.
Involving parents in the prevention of early school leaving.

The Europe 2020 strategy includes, as one of its headline targets, to reduce early school leaving to less than 10% by 2020. High rates of early school leavers mean a tremendous waste of potential and, as a consequence, a major barrier to individual, social and economic development. One consequence of ESL, as highlighted in research, is a higher risk of ending up in unemployment. A recent report published this autumn (2012)1 by the EU’s own research agency, Eurofound, discoveres that Europeans aged 15 to 29 who are not in employment, education or training (known as Neets) have reached record levels and are costing the EU € 3 bn a week in state welfare and lost production.
On a yearly basis costs reach a level of € 153 bn a year or 1.2% of the EU’s gross domestic product. 
As a response to the ESL problems, EU member states (MS) have undertaken to establish national targets, taking into account the starting positions and national circumstances of each MS. In 2009, 14% (16% men, 12% women) / one out of seven young people / approximately 6 million young people were considered early school leavers (ESL:ers). Latest Eurostat data (2011 figures) set the level at 13,5%; a small improvement from an overall perspective, but nevertheless displaying some encouraging improvements at country specific levels.


The PREVENT network was set up to find ways to reduce Early school leaving - with a special and in many ways innovative, idea to better involve parents in the preventive measures. PREVENT is a network of ten EU cities; Nantes (lead partner), Antwerp, Sofia, Gijon, Stockholm, Munich, the Hague, Ustinad Labem, Catania and Tallinn. Within the PREVENT network, we have translated Early School Leaving, hereby ESL, to include all forms of leaving education and training before completing upper secondary education or equivalents in vocational education and training. The European Union defines early school leavers as people aged 18-24 who have only lower secondary education or less and are no longer in education or training. Thus, ESL can take several forms; it includes young people who have dropped out of school before the end of compulsory education, those who have completed compulsory schooling, but have not gained an upper secondary qualification, and those who have followed pre-vocational or vocational courses, which did not lead to a qualification equivalent to upper secondary level.  ESL is a worldwide phenomenon, meaning that the negative impact of ESL is well known and widely discussed at an international level, thus boosting in the last five years. The theme is closely connected to areas such as Early childhood education and care (ECEC), integration and labour market policies and family affairs and is also therefore often discussed within a more holistic framework to be able to address its real fundamentals. It is also interesting to spend some time thinking about whether the overall societal change, maybe especially concerning a shift in values, attitudes, needs and behaviours, has something to do with the ESL syndrome. Such questions - emerging from a more philosophic point of view - could be:  Is school of today “the place to be” if you would like to boost yourself and your capabilities, and is school of today ready for structural change and innovation?  Do we really know the all the aspects / cultural, religious, socio-economical, shift in values and trends / that could have an impact on ESL?  Is ESL per definition the problem of some young individuals (young as problematic, youth at risk) – or are they to be considered marginalised youth? No doubt, a shift in focus would also change the nature of the problem, what caused it and which interventions that should be suggested and used  Are the young – and their parents – considered resources, given responsibilities, gaining true participation?  What happens in families when and if value base, relations and respect start to fall apart and when guiding and parenting schemes don’t seem to work?  ESL is not a “blame the victim” game. It is created following a complex process, and there has to be an open mind – at all levels – to embrace new insight, to work hard to find innovative and smart solutions and first and foremost, to do everything possible to implement necessary change. The core focus for the PREVENT network is to reduce ESL by involving parents in the preventive work. As true as this aspect is considered a major success factor, it also has its challenges. Involving parents as a tool to reduce ESL is not a spectator sport – it will challenge existing structures both on an operational, daily level as well as on a more systemic/strategic, long term one. Thus, if successful, it will have an impact on the way schools connect to parents and families, on the school climate, on the way support is being offered to both parents and teachers/ schools, on the way other actors could be involved – both actors within public services such as health care, social/welfare sector, youth polices etc, but also local organisations, clubs, service providers that interact in the life of families during free time, in leisure and sports activities and in supporting networks and structures.  Finally, there is also a need to influence the way cooperation and collaboration between actors, the “system”, really works. The ESL matter is a multidimensional effort, involving co-operational aspects and incentives for multi level governance processes as well as crosscutting, innovative processes involving actors that not always are or have been formally introduced as co partners on the ESL arena. Higher level and sustainable coordination, real parental participation, i.e. co-creation, in decision, planning and continuous follow up and reflection could be part of a baseline for an integrated approach to preventing ESL.  In the STATE OF ART section below you will find a brief overview on causes, consequences and good practice as highlighted in some of the research carried out during the last years concerning ESL. A special focus is parental involvement, as the PREVENT city network is stressing the work to find new and better ways to engage and involve parents in the prevention of early school leaving. The report is divided into two sections; Introduction and Outlook, where the Outlook section consists of four subsections; Early school leaving - setting the perspectives; Policies and strategies - what visions are there; Prevention – ideas, good examples and attempts and Involvement of parents in preventing ESL – what ways are there? Ideas and focus areas applying to the PREVENT work in the Implementation phase is described in the Synthesis section of the Baseline study. “Just everything, just teachers and everything, they’d just annoy you a lot so they would. If a teacher had it in for you, that’s it, she has it in for you the whole time. I don’t know really, I just didn’t like the people that teach us out there. And then again it was me, I couldn’t keep me mouth shut either, that was my problem in school…”  Mapping causes and consequences related to ESL – as well as finding good practice and developing innovative actions, preventive not the least – is considered a great concern. The growing number of conferences, reports and projects on the topic reveals ESL as being a major policy priority, not only in Europe but also across the developed world. From a general view, the reasons for highlighting the topic as such lies within whether cities, nations and Europe will be able to engage the young in future planning, supporting them in developing their talents and find acceptable ways to co produce - together with the young. It is true that today, knowledge, competencies and life skills could be found and trained in many places, contexts and situations – but even so, the negative effects of early school leaving are still far too serious not to be taken into consideration. Leaving school without the skills and qualifications that are considered necessary to make a successful transition between school and work causes problems and restraints not only for the young, but also for societies as such. And even if definitions on ESL vary across the world, studies and research show that many experiences are in the same direction. As an example, this goes both for young people’s reasons for leaving school early and for the kinds of negative effects and consequences that already are to be seen and/or that are assumed to take place in a more long term perspective.  From the perspective of URBACT, i. e. the cities’ perspective, the ESL is recognized by Eurocities2, the network of Europe’s major cities. In a position paper, Eurocities claims that ESL is considered by member cities as a complex, but also very concrete phenomenon - and as cities often have a set of special problems, they also have resources, experiences and know how to further develop and to disseminate good practice. The network believes cities must be given a special attention as ESL indicators differ among countries, regions and municipalities. The Eurocities working groups will proceed with further collection of evidence and definitions focusing on interventions that are effective at local level, as well as stressing the integrated approach (across different sectors) as main focus areas. 
SO, WHY BOTHER? 
The answer seems both easy and accepted; ESL has implications and negative consequences at the individual, social and economical dimensions. From an individual point of view, ESLers are more likely to be unemployed or in low-paid jobs, often leading to a dependency over time on welfare and social benefits. They are less likely to become “active citizens” and they are less often involved in life long learning3. Moreover, early school leavers run a higher risk of becoming involved in crime and antisocial behaviour than those engaged in learning. ESLers in average also to a great extent earn less throughout their working life than those having a degree. Also the fact that mental and psychosocial issues are one reason for young people leaving school early must be considered a major implication on the individual perspective of ESL, whether being a primary or a secondary reason.  From the public cost perspective, ESL generates high costs. Consequences on the cost side includes:  lower income and economic growth,  reduced tax revenues,  higher costs of public services such as healthcare, criminal justice and social benefit payments   In figures, it is calculated that staying in school for one extra year could improve your earnings with at least EUR 70 000. On the other hand, calculations in some countries (Finland, Netherlands, Ireland) show public costs for ESL within the span of EUR 1-2 million on a lifetime basis. As ESL is proportionally higher in urban areas, many cities, especially with regards to the emerging crisis, will experience higher costs to the welfare/social systems as unemployment rates are most likely to rise for the period to come. In several countries (Netherlands, Sweden, Norway) one highly ranked reason for leaving school is mental/psycho-social problems, reasons that most likely are generating high costs to health, psychology, welfare and social services. These conditions makes the reasons for cities to act towards a lower ESL rate both obvious and emerging. ESL is an issue not only important from a city development perspective; it is also about supporting individuals, young citizens and their families, to be able to do most of their talents, visions and dreams.  
AND WHO ARE THEY? 
As ESL is considered being a result of a process rather than a one-time event, causes on the individual level can be complex and not always easy to address with the right set of actions or “solutions”. ESLers are not a homogenous group, and there is often more than one problem that leads to the ESL situation. Then, where do they come from and who are they? A review through research as well as input from the PREVENT city network gives a picture where ESLers are more likely to : have socially disadvantaged backgrounds.  have (single) parents with low or even none educational background ; belong to vulnerable groups ;  have had a school background with high level of disengagement and poor achievement in school ;  come from minority or migrant backgrounds and ; have experienced a high level of residential as well as school mobility ;  live in areas where the concentration of families with certain problems and patterns that create a form of class and ethnic “ghetto-ism” could increase the risk for ESL ; be boys…   There is a clear distinction between studies in whether they pay any attention to the role of the young. The reason for this discrepancy is not clear, however only looking at the young as objectives in some recent reports is defined as totally impossible. Involving the young in the issues concerning themselves would promote positive outcomes at many levels, not least motivational, participative and the more inclusive perspectives. And as pointed out in the NESSE study, it is vital to remember that problems concerning the young are real problems, making them experts on their own situation. In situations when young people still are considered a problem, the participative approach could challenge existing policies and ways to work. And when asking the “experts” - the young themselves - the following bullet points could be used as a source of verification in the mapping of reasons for ESL:  Young people that leave school early are more likely to be unemployed as those that complete their education.  They are more likely to be in blue collar jobs with less employment security and more part-time work.  Pregnancy, crime, violence, alcohol and drug abuse, and suicide have been found to be significantly higher among early school leavers. Most of these issues are also found to be causes of early school leaving.  Early school leavers are more likely than other citizens to draw on welfare and other social programs throughout their lives.  Early school leavers have a shorter life expectancy.  They are less likely to be “active citizens”.  ESL is associated with a much lower propensity to become involved in lifelong learning. 
SYNTHESIS - The road ahead
“While it ’s never too early for parents to be involved, it is also true that it is never too late as children benefit from involvement at each and every stage of their lives...”  So what is the urban dimension to ESL? Why should URBACT cities pay attention to the subject, and what should be the level of response? From the work carried out within Eurocities’ working groups there are several good reasons why cities should bother. Some points on the emergent perspective of cities related to ESL as stated by the Eurocities work is that:  Cities have higher early school leaving rates than their regions or countries (Brussels, Vienna, Ireland, The Netherlands).  Early school leaving tends to be concentrated in some urban neighbourhoods (Gothenburg, Stockholm, The Netherlands).  There are growing disparities in educational attainment within cities (to be tested).  Early school leavers typically come from low socio-economic backgrounds, are often of migrant or ethnic minority origin and are mostly male.  There are many reasons for leaving school: school failure, lack of psycho-social support at school, home or among peers.   According to the working group, consequences are similar to other reports and findings:  Difficulties in getting a job.  Higher risk of being dependent on social welfare.   As when it comes to the kind of responses that cities could and should provide, city delegates propose the following measures:  School measures: extra teaching hours, career guidance and counselling, mentoring, teacher education.  Identification of a problem: data collection, early warning schemes.  Management and (re)allocation of resources for those most in need.  Networking and collaboration between social welfare system and schools, as well as with a wider range of actors.  School-wide: curricular changes, for example introducing more vocational subjects and working together with businesses. The figure below shows the result from the ET2020 country network analysis (see page 16). As the “spidergram” clearly marks the gaps in national actions, it at the same time highlights the ideas of the PREVENT network – namely to develop preventive measures to ESL by improving the involvement of parents, developing extra-curricular activities and to further develop the networking with parents, families and relevant actors within the local society. So far so good – but the spidergram could at the same time be used to discover “missing links” in what in general is being presented by many actors, not least official bodies, as the “one causes framework” for understanding the ESL phenomena. By adding recent knowledge on systems theory and by comparing “what happens in the ESL area” with other areas in society that have adapted a systems theory approach, new ideas will emerge as we discover new ways to study and to reflect on the ESL issue.  
An attempt to summarise the ESL scanning process and city visits 
An attempt to summarize “lessons learnt” from ESL work would give the following suggestions:  There is no unique model for preventing drop-out and ESL.  Education systems need to allow freedom - for schools, teachers, parents and students to initiate and implement change.  School drop-out is a process and intervention has to start early; early education and childcare is one vital key.  Curriculas have to be relevant, flexible and student focused.  School is only one part of the life of young people.  Social disadvantage does not necessarily lead to ESL; there is a correlation, but there should be ”zero tolerance” for ESL in all parts of society, not contraproductive arguments set up to explain why things ”are as they are”. Given the situation, it is vital - for many reasons - both for the young, their families and the society, to find new ways to reduce ESL. There is, as being highlighted in this study, a wide range of research trying to explore and explain ESL, and the focus on including measures aiming at supporting a more holistic understanding of the ESL issue is increasing. And even if there are differences in education systems and policies between countries, late research stresses an approach that on the one hand, has a clear focus on the situation of the individual young, while on the other hand and in parallel, on how we could work on a more flexible and collaborational way to improve schools and systemic issues to better meet the needs of today. But there is no quick or one fix to the ESL problem. Instead, we have to address the existing issues by learning from the ones we are talking about (the young), by adopting a multi stakeholder approach at many levels and by encouraging measures that could provide systemic change. We need to engage families, first and foremost parents, both in strengthening the bond to their children and in supporting their children in the educational process – to be active co-creators in reducing ESL. And we need to be innovative, thus to some extent still a bit realistic, to find new and functional ways to build trust, respect, motivation and collaboration between schools, families, children and other relevant actors, both within municipal services and outside, with organisations, clubs, the business society. Picking up on input gained from the state-of-the-art exercise would, when matched with the needs and ideas coming from network cities, form a good starting point to the implementation phase of the PREVENT project.  Emerging from the experiences from the state of the art scan and the city visits and discussions, a reasonable synthesis for the Implementation phase would be around the following issues – all being highlighted as a part of a successful action map, a chain of performance, to fight Early school leaving in general and, specifically, to find ways, levels and realistic measures to involve parents in the educational success of their children. The PREVENT network will be able to provide European cities valuable and hopefully innovative insight as well as concrete results regarding the prevention of ESL.  The PREVENT project aims at delivering input to URBACT cross cutting issues and to other, more specific areas of interest such as  Social innovation (the modernising, optimizing and restructuring of public services).  The ownership dialogue (governance issues, decision making, power structures, co creation/ co production incentives, power shift – and consequences of change).  Dimensions of cultural and/or ethnic minority issues (the need to find better and more integrated ways to tackle certain issues related to migrant/ ethnic communities, as well as ways to better involve community members in the change processes).  The promotion of stakeholder issues and the need for relevant capacity building (widening the perspective on stakeholders, target groups, roles and responsibilities; and, as a consequence, picking up on the need for capacity building to be able to fully participate).  Outputs and results, methodology aspects and sustainability (to work hard to promote a view that results are to be seen as outputs that are the pre assessors to outcomes, i.e. long term changes in behaviours on different levels; to be able to try to think outside the box – both with regards to promote innovation and critical thinking as well as to make necessary changes to promote sustainability, i.e. the coordination and optimisation of resources, management, systems, structures, thus reinforcing the capacity of relevant stakeholders to be able to bring about change in their respective environment).   As already mentioned in the study, the PREVENT network will work jointly to find an integrated approach to reducing ESL and in line with that attempt, to involve parents in the process. To be able to support the parental involvement in reducing ESL in cities it is vital to understand at least some of the underlying criteria – though considering the “blame the victim” risk that would appear as many stakeholders still promote a viewpoint only focusing on the individual (the student/the young) and/or the family aspects as causes to the problem. It is therefore important to stress that the ESL issue also touches on the more systemic and structural issues and that a permanent change will have to involve networking and learning actions – both horizontally as well as vertically. 
Further PREVENT actions 
 Finally, the PREVENT network will use the Baseline study input and the Final application to form a joint learning process around the following processes:  To be able to define and measure progress:  Determine and implement a set of indicators, namely structural, process as well as outcome indicators for Parental involvement.   To be able to promote comparison, learning and support of the implementation of good practice:  Develop (implement if possible) a functional system for peer reviewing, to be used both as a tool for PREVENT transnational workshops as well as for bilateral visits and exchange.   To be able to implement a cross-sectorial, integrated approach to preventing and reducing ESL:  Elaborate on systems theories and ways to present and understand them; to discuss and develop a HOW matrix focusing on change management and organisational needs.  To better define the role of “transitions” in the educational pathways of the young AS WELL AS of parents, caretakers and families; what do they mean in terms of lost knowledge (formal/informal), needs, progress etc, and what could be done to reinforce a positive transformation process.   To be able to support teachers and schools in the efforts and motivation to involve parents, students and the outside world (relevant stakeholders, both public, private and non governmental) in preventing and reducing ESL:  Develop and exchange ways to promote a good and positive school climate, developing teachers conflict resolution and cultural diversity skills, developing networking, collaborative and partnership approaches, models and tools; to understand the mechanisms of the outreach issue, especially related to vulnerable and excluded parents and families.   To empower parents to act as the most important co producers in the educational success of their children:  Parent peer support co-structures such as in courses for their children's language development.  Emotionally supportive approaches to communication, problem solving and guidance with children.  Supporting ways to better and smoother interactions with schools and public services.  Opening up schools to extra curricular activities (ideally run by parents), to encourage events etc.   To better find ways to engage with the young:  Understanding the drivers that lead to lack of motivation and wrong study choice, searching for young people’s explanations and aspirations; to develop alternative curriculas based on individual approaches and success; to make the young pilots of the educational process of themselves and to help understanding psychological and mental barriers to a positive engagement process, disregarding reasons (family, social or psychological).

"PROCURE.
CREATING A GOOD LOCAL ECONOMY THROUGH PROCUREMENT.
1 INTRODUCTION
This baseline study report provides further information about the ‘creating a good local economy through procurement’ (Procure) network. The Procure network is one of 21 networks commissioned through the European Union’s URBACT III programme, which seeks to enable transnational exchange and learning between cities around a particular theme. The Procure network seeks to connect cities and build success around the theme of procurement, which is the process used by public authorities and commercial business to purchase goods and services. 
1.1 The purpose of Procure. 
The purpose of the Procure network is to support cities to enhance procurement processes so that they bring greater benefits for their city economy and in social and environmental terms. The focus of Procure is not just upon city authorities (municipalities), but the range of ‘anchor institutions’ which have a significant stake in that city. Anchor institutions will generally employ hundreds of people, have multi-million Euro levels of procurement spend, and are unlikely to leave that city. They will include municipalities, health institutions, police and other emergency services, universities, social housing providers, and private sector businesses. These institutions should be delivering more benefit for the city in which they are based, and procurement is a way of enabling that to happen. Utilising procurement more progressively and innovatively has become possible since the introduction of the new European Procurement regulations in February 2014. These regulations seek amongst other things: ‘to facilitate the participation of small to medium sized enterprises (SMEs) in public procurement in support of common societal goals’. Procure seeks to ensure that through engagement with partner cities behaviour is shifted so that procurement derives greater benefit.  
2 ‘STATE OF THE ART’ 
2.1 Why is procurement important? 
This element of the ‘state of the art’ outlines why the process of procurement is important for city economies both socially, economically and environmentally across Europe. 
2.1.1 The challenges and opportunities facing cities.
Cities across Europe are facing a number of economic, social and environmental challenges. These include: High levels of unemployment and particularly youth unemployment; A struggle to respond to economic restructuring as a result of a reliance upon a singular industry; Migration and the need to create jobs to support both local and incoming residents; Increasing levels of carbon emissions and a need to make the transition towards a low carbon economy; Issues in developing the skills of workforces so that they can respond to the demands of a global economy. These are also opportune times for European cities: Firms are continuing to want to invest in urban areas; There are an array of urban development programmes across the European Union; focused upon developing both physical infrastructure and alleviating social issues; Infrastructure and connectivity across Europe is improving with associated knock-on effects for the movement of trade and labour. 
2.1.2 Linking the challenges and opportunities facing cities to procurement.
The image on the right side of the diagram below crudely depicts the outcome of economic policy making in European Cities over the last 30 years for some local places. There has been a stream of investment through infrastructure development, inward investment, the public purse, and regeneration initiatives designed to improve them; but some places remain unchanged. There are not enough good quality jobs; businesses are not productive enough; people remain unskilled; and any growth that is being created is benefiting the few and actually exacerbating inequality. The image on the right could also apply to the way in which procurement has been traditionally undertaken across Europe. As a result of legislation and an associated unwillingness to take risks, the procurement spend of city governments and other anchor institutions has not necessarily led to or contributed towards addressing the economic, social and environmental challenges facing that city. Economic development policy making, investment and indeed procurement needs to think more virtuously, whereby: the investment in a city is retained in the city economy through supporting local supply chains and local employment. As a result local people are more able to influence the activities being undertaken; and activities are undertaken by and are beneficial for a broader mix of stakeholders across the public, commercial and social sectors. This is effectively depicted in the image on the left hand side of the diagram above; where wealth is retained and investment brings a range of economic, social and environmental benefits. This is the core purpose of the Procure network: to change the behaviour of procurers so that the process is undertaken more innovatively leading to greater benefits for cities across Europe. This complements the objectives of the new European Directives around procurement.  
2.1.3 The outcomes procurement can contribute towards. 
It can be argued that procurement can contribute towards a range of outcomes in cities across Europe through changing the behaviour of municipalities and other anchor institutions. 
Economic.   
Procurement can support local businesses both directly and through subcontracting opportunities; Procurement can support new local businesses to develop, which address key challenges and fill gaps in provision; 
Social   
Procurement can support businesses to create new jobs and support existing jobs for residents of the city; Procurement can support the creation of apprenticeships and the upskilling of local residents and their pay ;   Procurement can support the development of new forms of enterprises and cooperatives ; Procurement through the above activities can support the achievement of wider outcomes around health and crime, for example;   Procurement can stimulate social innovation through institutions codesigning services with communities and utilising social economy and social enterprise organisations in delivery. 
Environmental   
Procurement can assist in reducing the distance which goods and services travel; Procurement can assist in stimulating technological innovation through encouraging the market to develop new technologies which address both good and service requirements and enable environmental advances; Procurement can improve the look of cities and improve the local environment particularly where innovative processes are utilised in the design process and where creative individual are procured to design, build and manage new facilities and infrastructure. It is important to note that each of the above outcomes can be achieved and that the new regulations from Europe support municipalities to achieve wider societal goals through procurement. 
2.1.4 The policy fit of Procure.
 The development of the Procure network and its emphasis upon procurement is aligned to both wider European Union policy making; wider thinking about the future of cities across Europe; and existing knowledge, projects and networks working on procurement and associated issues. In terms of Europe 2020 and its emphasis upon jobs and growth, procurement can be a means of enabling growth which is smart (through more effective investments in education, research and innovation); sustainable (thanks to a decisive move towards a low carbon economy); and inclusive (with a strong emphasis on job creation and poverty reduction). Procurement should also be a component element of thinking and recommendations associated with the ESPON work on economic crisis and the resilience of the regions and around place. Whilst other URBACT and wider European funded projects have had a degree of emphasis upon procurement or have looked at it as part of a wider issue, the Procure network is the first which looks at procurement holistically as a means of enabling local economic, social and environmental benefit. For example, the Sustainable Food in Urban Communities network looked at procurement as part of a much wider focus upon urban food systems and healthy public food provision. Similarly, the Electric Vehicles in Urban Europe19 network explored how procurement could be used as one of the tools for overcoming barriers in the uptake of electric vehicles. Other relevant past URBACT networks include: diet for a green planet pilot transfer network; 4D Cities; Roma-Net II; and WEED project. Procurement also forms part of other projects associated with Horizon 2020 and INTERREG programmes. The focus in Procure upon procurement and economic, social and environmental benefit is the first time procurement has been looked at holistically as part of the URBACT Programme and also other programmes such as NWE INTERREG IVB and INTERREG IVC. Indeed, procurement was identified as a key area of innovation in URBACT II’s capitalisation report ‘Social Innovation in Cities’, particularly where cities have used public procurement policies to encourage ‘unusual’ providers in the form of SMEs, NGOs or groups of citizens to access calls for tenders and projects. The importance of utilising purchasing power for jobs and growth benefits was also referred to in the wider capitalisation article from the URBACT II programme, with a reflection that ‘more localised supply chains, in food or construction materials, can be driven by cities to bring greater sustainability and grow local jobs’.  The process of procurement is often split into four parts. There is the commissioning of the good or service; the development of procurement strategy; pre-procurement; and the delivery of the good or service and monitoring. Ways of maximising benefit for city economies in socio-economic and environmental terms across Europe, can be built in at each of the parts of the process by municipalities and anchor institutions. 
2.4.1 Service commissioning.
 Cities can enable and maximise benefit for city economies in socio-economic and environmental terms across Europe, through the procurement process in the commissioning phase. This can include: Linking procurement to wider corporate priorities.
 The purpose of any procurement process must always be to commission services and goods, which are required by service users in a cost efficient way. However there are a range of wider economic, social and environmental benefits which can be achieved through the process in terms of jobs, skills, business development, and a reduction in the distance travelled by goods. One of the most straightforward ways of progressing procurement is to link the process to the wider corporate priorities of a municipality. Most municipalities will have a priority around addressing unemployment, for example. They can raise awareness of this issue by detailing it in procurement strategy and making potential suppliers aware that it is an issue in the procurement process. 
Reflecting community need.
 They can seek to ensure that service design and commissioning is reflective of community need, by engaging and consulting communities upon the design of services. This is emerging in the concept of co-production, where institutions and residents design services collaboratively, and where communities can have responsibility for small elements of budgets. This ensures that procurement is reflective of the needs and wants of communities, thus bringing benefits for local people. 
2.4.2 Procurement strategy.
 Cities can maximise benefit for city economies and in economic, social and environmental terms across Europe through the procurement process in the procurement strategy phase. This can include: Developing procurement strategies with a common narrative. These set out a municipalities or organisation’s priorities and processes in relation to procurement practice. They are a key means by which priorities and criteria relating to economic, social and environmental wellbeing can be embedded, ensuring that priorities feed into the decision making process for all contracts. They also highlight to suppliers the types of benefit city governments are expecting them to demonstrate in their response to tenders. Using social and environmental criteria. Traditionally cities and particularly municipalities have undertaken procurement using two criteria: cost and quality. Often cost in some countries and procurements will be the only consideration as the procurer seeks maximum efficiency and the best price. Quality of the products being offered and the experience of the organisation delivering is also considered regularly. However, cities can also consider social and environmental criteria in procurement strategy and in the associated tender documents and decision. This can be done by assigning, for example, ten percent of the decision to the extent to which potential suppliers detail that they will address social and environmental issues. 
2.4.3 Pre-procurement.
 They can maximise benefit for city economies and in social and environmental terms across Europe through the procurement process in the pre-procurement phase. This can include: Working with local business to test markets Procurement teams can work with economic development teams to identify local businesses, particularly SMEs, who might be suitable to bid for certain contract opportunities. Targeted market testing could be focused on businesses in specific sectors or based in particular parts of the city. They can follow up market testing with targeted capacity building. They can also engage with potential suppliers before formally putting a service out to tender through holding meetings and events. These enable institutions to detail their specifications in relation to a particular contract and to inform suppliers of what is expected of them in the tendering process, including any requirements around economic, social and environmental benefit. They also provide the opportunity to informally develop suppliers’ skills in tendering. Engagement work with business networks. They can make local businesses, particularly SMEs, aware of procurement opportunities through developing relationships with business representative bodies such as Chambers of Commerce and small business organisations. These organisations can also provide advice and guidance to their members about bidding for procurement opportunities, and also assist in developing capacity and capability. Capacity building of social economy organisations. They can provide capacity building support for both SMEs and social economy organisations, which gives them the knowledge and skills to bid for contract opportunities. This approach is not about preferential treatment, but about local organisational development. Capacity building can focus upon raising awareness of opportunities, the process of completing a PQQ, or getting a social economy organisation tender ready. It could also involve one-to-one tendering support. Apprenticeships, labour and social clauses. They can enable benefit by stipulating in tender documentation the requirement for contractors to add value for communities beyond service delivery. In construction projects, this could include a requirement to create apprenticeships for every euro 1 million spent, or a desire to create jobs for those who are unemployed. In more service focused activities, it could include wider social benefits such as community work. 
2.4.4 Delivery and monitoring. 
They can maximise benefit for city economies and in both socio-economic and environmental terms across Europe, through the procurement process in the delivery stage. This can include: Developing supplier networks. They can enable benefit and continuously ensure that wider economic, social and environmental benefit is considered in service delivery through the establishment of supplier networks. Supplier networks ensure a continuous relationship between buyer and supplier. Historically, goods and services have gone out to contract and suppliers have gone away and delivered the required service. A supplier network enables these institutions to voluntarily influence the behaviour of suppliers by informing them of corporate priorities and wider expectations around economic, social and environmental benefit; and in turn ensure these aspects of benefit are being delivered. Continuous spend analysis and outcomes monitoring. They can continuously seek to identify the impact their procurement spend brings for their locality through spend analysis and contract monitoring. Through geographical analysis, they can identify the extent to which spend lies with suppliers based in or within a branch in their municipality boundary; and spend within particular areas of the city. Through contract monitoring, institutions can identify the extent to which suppliers re-spend in the local economy upon local suppliers and employees of their own; and the extent to which they are adding value to wider local priorities and outcomes. Spend analysis can also be utilised to identify areas of spend which are ‘influenceable’ and ‘non-infuenceable’. In relation to the barrier around protectionism, it can be used to identify contracts which are not conducive to local economic, social and environmental benefits and those which are. The Procure network is about supporting cities to maximise the impact their procurement spend brings for their local economies and in economic and social terms. Framed by the new European Directives and a realisation that procurement can be utilised as one of the ways in which challenges facing European cities can addressed; this State of the Art has sought to provide a context to the theme of innovative and progressive procurement. The development of Procure comes at an opportune moment. The European Directives came into effect in February 2014 and member countries are required to embed their principles into national level law by April 2016. The principles are important as not only do they require cities to be compliant and accountable around procurement; but they also provide the opportunity to be flexible particularly around the engagement of SMEs and the achievement of wider societal goals. Undertaking innovative and progressive procurement is however restricted by a range of barriers; notably around: law and bureaucracy; the behaviour of municipalities and other anchor institutions; the behaviour of suppliers; measuring impact; and geography. The means of maximising economic, social and environmental benefits through commissioning, procurement strategy, preprocurement, and delivery and the associated case studies presented in the ‘state of the art’ will be explored as part of the Procure network going forward. However, the learning and practice could and should be adopted across other cities in Europe to enable the impact of procurement to be maximised.

"RE-Block REviving high-rise Blocks for cohesive and green neighbourhoods.

INTRODUCTION 
The RE-Block project, which ran from February 2013 to April 2015, was supported by URBACT, a European exchange and learning programme promoting sustainable urban development. The RE-Block project was designed to exchange and develop good practice in creating a sustainable future for rundown high rise housing estates on local level benefitting from the support provided by the programme and the exchange of experience among the project partners of the RE-Block network. 
The 10 partners in the RE-Block came together because of their common interest in the future of their high rise housing estates and a desire to exchange in tackling the physical, social problems of these estates. The main issue addressed by RE-Block was how to foster the regeneration of these neighbourhoods, making them more attractive and improving their environmental quality, whilst creating an integrated tailor-made approach to combat poverty. The findings and conclusions of RE-Block will be relevant for the different governmental levels, including the European Commission. 
Through the exchange of knowledge and practices, RE-Block partners have been able to see their local problems through of the eyes of the others and enlightening and the role of the city partners. 
This Final Report presents the main outcomes and learning points of the RE-Block project.
POLICY CONTEXT 
Between the late 1960s and early 1980s numerous large scale high rise housing estates were constructed in response to handle the shortage of good quality housing in cities all over Europe. The main reason of this shortage were very similar in the different countries: the damage to housing as a consequence of the Second World War, the continuous migration from the countryside to the cities, and the need for more housing as a result of social demographic changes. However it is important to make a difference between countries in Western Europe where these big housing estates represent no more than 8%, while in Central and Eastern Europe the estimated proportion can vary between 15 and 60%. 
In both western European and former socialist countries the majority of these high rise estates were built as public housing, developed and managed by the government, although subsequently there has been large scale privatisation of the housing stock which has created further issues, such as the unfavourable tendency in population change in the estates and the difficulty of encouraging private owners to invest in property maintenance. During the design process, the architects and planners of the time aimed to apply theories and principles of urban development for a modern society and a modern way of living. At first, it was prestigious to live in this new environment, which offered inhabitants good living conditions and a better quality of life. Many of these estates still have no major problems. Others no longer meet environmental standards or provide communal facilities and public spaces. In addition to the amortisation of the buildings and the environment, and the consequences of the financial, economic crises, the estates are home to many people experiencing social and economic deprivation and to problems of crime and antisocial behaviour. The condition of these estates and the economic and social circumstances of their residents is therefore a major policy issue for the European Union.
Three common dimensions of the problems were identified in the Re-Block partner:
a) Social Dimension:
Multiple levels of deprivation (high number of disadvantaged, indebted inhabitants living closely together, disintegrated population, low income and education level, high rate of unemployment).
 Conflicts resulting from cultural/ethnic diversity (the cohabitation of different cultures and ethnic groups resulting in social segregation and territorial detachment).
 Disintegrative attitude of inhabitants (lack of common representation, no sence of community, low level of initiatives and cooperation).
b) Physical Dimension:
 Unattractive public spaces (need for more green spaces, lack of proper maintenance, mono-functional open spaces, lack of sense of property).
 Periphery/Isolation (population physically, geographically and/or functionally cut from the urban network leading to feeling of isolation.
 Architecture and energy efficiency (apartment and block design is outdated, unattractive, rundown, not energy efficient).
c) Governance Dimension:
 Lack of public private cooperation in rehabilitation (no links between private and public stakeholders, citizens are not properly involved in the decision making process).
 Lack of sustainable policy solutions and capacities (local authorities do not possess tools and experience to develop effective policies).
 Lack of private investors and funds (lack of workable schemes to attract private investors into urban rehabilitation programmes).
The relative importance of each of these dimensions varies between partner cities all 3 dimensions exist to a greater or lesser degree in every city. In addition the legal, financial and governmental situation was different in each country. The RE-Block project therefore provided the opportunity for the 10 partner to develop principles of good practice into tailored regeneration solutions to prevent further physical deterioration of their estates and develop new social perspectives for the residents of the housing estates as part of the community. One particularly important aspects of this was to evolve governance models with the active contribution of key local stakeholders and representatives of the residents.

THE GOALS OF THE RE-BLOCK PROJECT 
At the start of the project the ten partner cities were at different stages of estate regeneration. They were all looking for new ways to boost development activity in the deprived housing estates of their cities. The project was designed to provide partners with improved capacities in: 
Developing an integrated approach in the planning process of the Local Action Plan identifying interlinking physical and social interventions presented in a single strategy for sustainable estate regeneration. 
Developing inclusive governance practices concerning planning processes and regeneration. 
Developing and adapting good practices that can be applied to each local situations.

MAIN OUTPUTS OF THE RE-BLOCK PROJECT. 
LOCAL ACTION PLANS. 
All partners in the RE-Block network successfully applied the URBACT model. Local Support Groups were established bringing together key stakeholders interested in estate regeneration in most cases including civil associations and representatives of the residents. The ULSGs, in some cases with the assistance of external experts, such as the Knowledge Ambassadors nominated by the partners, elaborated the Local Action Plans. LAPs are different, as the local situation, including the legal and institutional set up, are different, but they all designed as integrated local strategies to tackle the particular problems of estate regeneration specifically in the field of social and built environment and governance. The planning process was tailored to incorporate the learning and understanding from the Peer Review process.

The analysis of the Local Action Plans aiming at the estate regeneration shows: 
LAPs for estate regeneration need to fit in wider city or regional strategies. 
Emphasis on social and community aspects (it is also reflected on higher level policy recommendations). 
Image improvement need to be integral parts of the regeneration strategy and need management and coordination with other development activities. 
 The issue of social inclusion is closely linked with governance. 
 Small scale interventions can result inviting public spaces (place-making philosophy and process) providing opportunities for social interactions. 

POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS 
Overall, the Re-block network of the ten partner cities identified and agreed in the need of 3 main policy changes which are to facilitate the regeneration of the high rise housing estates in Europe. 
1. Not just the buildings: a holistic and cross-sectoral approach to regeneration is needed. 
All partners in the project recognised that dealing with elements of estate regeneration in isolation does not produce the most cost effective or sustainable results. A comprehensive approach is required, not only on the estate itself but at city wide level. This also includes the recognition that reducing the isolation of an estate - both in social and physical terms – requires considerations and interventions as part of the wider city strategy. Funding opportunities and conditions are often not in favour of development processes, especially when the integrated approach in planning needs to be turned into practice by implementing social actions hand in hand with quality upgrade of the built environment in housing estates. This means that effective coordination is needed to work across different sectors, involving different departments and agencies to work together. At the same time, integrated and flexible funding streams should be available to enable a holistic approach that focuses on the multiple problems facing deprived housing estates.
2. Inclusive Governance: together with the residents. 
It is a cliché that estate generation is complex and that partnership working to address multiple estate issues in an integrated and cross-sectoral way is essential. However, due to the complexity of the development issues it is critical from the planning and implementation point of view that the knowledge on the living environment available at the various actors/stakeholders including the residents of the estate with the right sources of knowledge (cultural capital) and social connections (social capital) is taken into consideration and used as a resource. Therefore inclusive methods of communication and problem solving as part of the partnership practice needs to be fostered horizontally, vertically and through European funding.
3. Good quality housing underpins good health and wellbeing. 
One of the major obstacles to achieving a sustainable scheme for high rise estates is the spread of ownership of individual properties, often caused by former public housing sold to investment funds, and with the ownership splitting up into many single flat owners. Among other things this has led to insufficient long term maintenance and remediation of the flats and the high rise structures themselves. In particular there is a lack of private investments in housing stock on estates. Scientific evidence shows links between poor housing and degraded urban environment and health risks. A policy lesson from the RE-Block is that the EU and national governments should seek means to assist landlords in the quality refurbishment of housing stock as part of the regeneration process in order to make deprived housing estates attractive places to live and through a holistic approach to the built environment and the social conditions contribute to the regeneration of their cities as a whole.
SMART URBAN GOVERNANCE GUIDELINES. 
Current urban regeneration practice shows a move from the formal approach to the development of more complex programmes. To develop problematic housing estates as places of sustainable living, there is also a need for integrated urban actions at local level. It has been recognised that integrated actions require a governance framework that integrates a wide range of stakeholders, such as public authorities involving different departments, public institutions acting in sectoral domains, residents, NGOs, private companies, etc. defined by the complexity of estate regeneration. 
Governance generally refers to the process of decision-making and the process by which decisions are implemented. It implies the consultation, coordination and cooperation among the different partners in order to achieve common objectives. Experience has demonstrated that, when talking about the range of institutions involved in the regeneration programmes, the municipal level tends to be the most important actor of the governance framework. Therefore Municipalities are the primarily beneficiaries of the Smart Urban Governance Guidelines providing them with a practice oriented guidance on governance based on good practice examples from RE-Block partner cities.
SPIN-OFF PROJECTS. 
The spin-off projects elaborated in the framework of the RE-Block were to demonstrate a possible way linking the planning phase of the LAPs with implementation and also the possible continuation of RE-Block project on transnational level. By matching commonly defined development issues of the LAPs with funding opportunities of the 2014-2020 programming period 3 project ideas were elaborated: 
Improving energy efficiency of the blocks at the estate is combined with the creation of green jobs. Improving social inclusion at the estate is to be achieved by boosting the employment possibilities exploring low-cost solutions at municipality level. 
Improving image of the high rise housing estates and the environment for local business by reducing physical and social isolation through a more targeted and strategic urban planning process.

 REDIS.

 (Re)Developing Science Quarters in Cities.
Introduction. 
It is generally recognized that knowledge has become the prime source of wealth in advanced economies. This is in line with the vision that European leaders have set in the Lisbon Summit at the beginning of the new century: a competitive Europe that bases its economic strength on knowledge and creativity. The Lisbon Goals include the promotion of innovation, the enhancement of scientific research and its commercialization, and the increase of the skills level of the labor force. National governments have committed to these goals and share the ambitions. In the early years, the ‘Lisbon Goals’ were mainly understood as a pan-European and national matter. 
Increasingly, however, urban regions have become recognized as important active ‘engines’ and promoters of the knowledge economy. Europe’s cities are the main centers of knowledge creation, commercialization and innovation, and their policies and attitudes can make an important difference. 
In the REDIS project, we focus on one particular and highly significant aspect of urban policy for the knowledge economy: how to create or promote special locations, zones, quarters or parks, where knowledge based companies and institutes are co-located. These can be new locations (greenfield initiatives) or redevelopment projects that aim to transform existing urban districts. It is in these locations that Europe’s knowledge economy has its focal point. They are the cradles of innovation, and therefore lay an important basis for future prosperity. 
Based on reviewing existing literature, case studies and other sources, it can be concluded that there are several ‘knowledge gaps’ surrounding the development of science quarters. We will address them in our project. 
Develop science quarters as integrated part of the city 
There has been substantial research and many policy initiatives to support ‘free standing’ science parks. However, there is a growing recognition that science parks or ‘science quarters’ should be developed as an integrated part of the city. There has been growing interest in different forms of science quarters. Strikingly, however, there has been no systematic analysis of the conditions and policies required to develop successful quarters. ‘Integrated’ science quarters are embedded in the physical and social structure of the city, and this raises a number of issues, such as how to involve the (large number of ) stakeholders, how to ensure connectivity with adjacent areas, how to avoid large disparities etc. Moreover, the policy process of developing such quarters is very complex as well. Many actors are typically involved, with different agenda’s. Especially the optimization of the ‘triple helix’ at the local level deserves attention here. It is difficult to make ‘blueprints’ or generally applicable guidelines in this respect, but nevertheless, the REDIS project aims to reveal common issues and lines. REDIS takes 8 cities with different conditions at different stages of developing science quarters. This will result in a series of guidelines, tips, examples and recommendations for cities that want to set up science quarters. Moreover, we will organize ‘external’ site visits to successful knowledge quarters in Europe and seek to derive lessons from their approach. 
Elaborate specific themes in depth 
There is a lack of systematic knowledge about a number of specific themes and topics in relation to science quarters (examples are: marketing & branding, dealing with heritage, optimizing the ‘triple helix’ on the local level, management models for areas). A number of individual case studies and descriptions of ‘good practice’ exist, but what lacks is a systematic and comparative perspective that can serve as a basis for learning for other cities. In REDIS we intend to fill this gap, by selecting a set of key themes (based on the needs of the partner cities) and elaborate them in depth, from a comparative perspective, in our eight partner cities (but also using insights and lessons from good practice cases all over Europe). In REDIS, we will create guidelines, tips, examples and recommendations for cities. This baseline study has been a key instrument to identify relevant themes for each city, by interviewing key stakeholders in each partner city in a systematic way. 
Address complex governance issues 
There is a growing recognition that the ‘success’ of a science quarter is the result of a complex interplay between local, regional, national and European level factors and policies. However, it is less clear how these levels interact, and how the interplay can be rendered more fruitful. National conditions and policies are important success factors for science quarters (national science policy, regulations etc.) but there is little knowledge about how to align ‘generic’ national approaches to the particular needs of particular cities. The same can be said of European policies and policy frameworks (EU framework policies, ERDF operational programmes, science policy etc.). These policies are not designed by cities but their effects are strongly felt ‘on the ground’. Here also, the challenge is to improve the alignment between policy levels, learning from the experience of cities. In REDIS, we intend to create a set of broader policy recommendations for national and EU policy on the general conditions for science quarters. Moreover, we intend to inform and inspire the regional operational programmes that are significant for some of our partner cities. Managing authorities are therefore fully involved in the REDIS project. 
One of the key aims of the REDIS project is to contribute to the development of the science quarters in each respective partner city. Therefore, each partner has set up a local support group, consisting of key decision makers/stakeholders in the science quarter. Members of this group are actively involved in REDIS’ activities and also provide significant inputs. They are the main beneficiaries of activities at the level of REDIS and the thematic pole, and REDIS will ensure mechanisms to make this work. Moreover, Local Action Plans will be deeply informed by findings, results and lessons that come out of the project’s exchange activities. For this baseline study, a number of LSG members have been interviewed, to learn their view and expectations of the REDIS project and to ensure their commitment. This way, it is ensured that the REDIS project from the start deals with themes and topics of direct relevance to the key stakeholders ‘on the ground’ in each partner city.
The development of knowledge economy within urban regions is vital for the future of Europe. This is why city policies and attitudes about centres of innovation and the creation and commercialization of knowledge are essential for the future. The eight partners of the REDIS project focused for two and a half years on one main aspect of knowledge economy policy: they tried to understand how to develop special locations, zones, quarters or parks, where knowledge-based companies and institutes can be jointly located. Each partner already had an urban development of this type (a “knowledge hotspot”) in various degrees of advancement, and wanted to share best practices and learn from others.
Key Challenges 
Project partners all faced two specific challenges:
How to develop ""science quarters"" as an integrated part of the city.

This meant evaluating the kind of conditions and policies that lead to successfully embedding science sites inside cities. It implies not only avoiding creating islands of elitism and glaring disparities, but also embedding knowledge hotspots into the social and urban structure of this city.
How to handle complex governance issues.

Little was known in detail about the complex interplay between local, regional, national and European actors and policies in building successful knowledge hotspots in cities. The project therefore had to find new ways of organizing the triple helix (industry-government-universities) that can effectively link generic national models to specific needs in a particular environment.
Main Results.

Designing a concept. 
A successful knowledge hotspot targets clearly defined groups with a concept that gives them a joint identity around a common theme. This could be a knowledge area such as the life sciences or a more challenging theme such as creativity. Companies located there can cooperate by sharing resources. In terms of urban design and landscaping, a hotspot will express its ambitions and commonalities in the physical layout.
Governance issues.
Although the various stakeholders (land owners, developers, tenants, inhabitants, knowledge institutes and city departments) will inevitably have diverging interests and ambitions, it is vital for a knowledge hotspot to be managed well by a supervisory team that can reconcile these differences and provide a nurturing environment for discussion and resolutions.
Cooperation between city and university.
A knowledge hotspot cannot work as a stand-alone development, a ghetto for boffins. It needs to be well connected to the entire urban fabric, with economic, physical and social links with the city itself. In this way it can energize its local environment and add an innovative touch to the life of the city.
Recommendations & Prospects. 
There is obviously no blueprint for integrating knowledge hubs into the city. Each experience is uniquely associated with the historical and geographical context of each urban environment. 
However, there are a number of good reasons why knowledge hotspots are worth developing. The key to success is that the people involved – usually talented and creative people - should feel happy to live, work and relax there. 
The challenge therefore is to design the right kind of dynamic environment with appropriate amenities that attracts this particular demographic and encourages them to settle in the area.
Once there, the knowledge hotspot can become a strong attractor for events, concerts, and exhibitions of all kinds that draw citizens to the area.
Knowledge hotspots send out a strong signal that the city in question is playing a pro-active role in the knowledge economy as a whole. It might achieve this by upgrading a degraded neighbourhood, and transforming it into a locus where research and business can work together in synergy to promote innovation.


Many cities and regions have the ambition to promote their ‘knowledge  economy’: it is generally recognized that  knowledge has become the prime source  of wealth in advanced economies. This  book focuses on one particular way to  promote the urban knowledge economy:  the creation of knowledge ‘hotspots’.  
The term ‘urban knowledge hotspot’, as we use  it, includes concepts like science parks, technology parks, all sorts of campuses, creative  districts, science quarters, etc . Some knowledge locations focus on one specific branch or  technology (i.e. bio science parks, media hubs),  others are more diversified. Some are integrated  into the city, some are developed at greenfield locations (figure 1). Generally speaking, a know ledge hotspot is a designated area where the focus lies on knowledge-based economic development.  Knowledge hotspots are believed to have a number of advantages. They provide opportunities for facility sharing (i.e. the joint use of ex- pensive facilities such as cleanrooms or laboratorial facilities); they may enhance networking and face-to-face interaction, which may result  in more innovation. Knowledge hotspots could help to strengthen links between companies and universities, and provide a favourable incubating environment for start-ups. Moreover, knowledge hotspots can help to ‘market’ the city as progressive knowledge-based city: they give the local  knowledge economy a face and an address. finally, knowledge hotspots are increasingly seen  as a powerful tool for urban regeneration. Many cities seek to transform derelict urban areas into  ‘creative districts’.  
What makes a  good knowledge hotspot? 
A good knowledge hotspot has at least four features:  it has a joint identity;  its target groups and concept  are clearly defined;  it is well connected to the city and  it is well managed. Joint identity:  In a good knowledge hotspot, ac- tors and activities have things in common, share ambitions and develop some degree of joint identity and belonging. There can be a common image/identity around a particular theme (i.e. life sciences, environmental technology, or design).  Other types of ‘togetherness’ may emerge if companies closely co-operate, or use each other’s services, or if they share common facilities. Also, the location can become a hotspot for information exchange (‘gossip and buzz’), making it the ‘place to be’ to pick up new information and trends. There are several ways to promote ‘togetherness’ and identity: by organising events, offering joint facilities, promoting co-operation.  A good knowledge hotspot is designed (in terms of urban design and landscaping) in such a way that its ambitions, identity and commonalities are  expressed in the physical layout.  Target groups:  A good knowledge hotspot has clear primary target groups. These may be specific types of companies, research institutes, other organisations, or people. It is important to prevent a massive inflow of unrelated activities.  It’s not only about permanent tenants. A hotspot can also become a place of networking and temporary activity, such as events (seminars, conferences, demonstrations). In the knowledge economy, temporary activities are growing in importance, with new, mobile ways of working and an increased domination of project work with  changing partners. A good knowledge hotspot is not a boring mono functional place (work-only):  it also should include leisure, retail functions, or even housing.  
Knowledge hotspots must be attractive places.
 The key to any successful knowledge hotspot development is that knowledge workers should feel happy to work, live, and -at times- relax  there. Talented people are the key drivers for innovation, especially higher educated, entrepreneurial and creative people. Places that that manage to attract/retain these people are successful in the knowledge economy. The challenge for cities is to create dynamic environments where these people feel happy and at ease: attractive areas, with good amenities, good jobs, good food, a great ambiance, and good connections. Connections: A good knowledge hotspot is not a stand-alone development: it is well-connected to the urban fabric. This is reflected in fruitful economic, social and physical links between the hotspot and the city. A well-connected hotspot contributes to the urban liveliness and dynamics, and adds to innovation power of the city. Ten- ants/inhabitants of the hotspot can tap from the diversity and amenities of the urban economy, and realise synergies. Moreover, ideally, a hotspot is not a ‘ghetto for boffins’ but rather an open and welcoming space. Chapter 6 elaborates further on this issue. Good management.  A good knowledge hotspot is well-managed. This is a complex task given the often diverging interests and ambitions of  stakeholders (land owners, developers, tenants,  inhabitants, knowledge institutes, city departments).   
Six reasons for developing a ‘knowledge hotspot’.  
Attracting/retaining knowledge workers and businesses. Attracting events and other temporary activity. Signalling that the city plays a pro-active role in the knowledge economy. Upgrading a degraded area or neighbourhood. Promoting innovation. Bringing research and business closer together. 

 BIOTECH, CLEAN ENERGY, CREATIVE INDUSTRIES? DESIGNING A CONCEPT FOR THE HOTSPOT. 
 In urban planning, the ‘conceptual’ approach is gaining ground, and this approach is very well applicable to the  development of knowledge hotspots.  A conceptual development assumes a central unifying idea, an overarching  theme that unites the different functions  and users of a locality, and creates or  fosters a particular identity of place.  Many cities and developers try to create hotspots around a particular theme. This thematic focus may be a particular sector  (IT, or biotech for example), or based on  broader notions like ‘design’, ‘creativity’,  or ‘cleantech’.   

PROMOTING INNOVATION ON THE SPOT?  

‘More innovation’ is one of the promising features of a knowledge hotspot.  The added value of a knowledge hotspot becomes evident when it is not a mere collection of similar tenants, but really a  catalyst for innovation. 
  
HOW TO RUN  A KNOWLEDGE HOTSPOT? SOME GOVERNANCE MODELS. 
A ‘knowledge hotspot’ (a science quarter, creative district, a campus) can be seen as a real estate project like any  other, with investments and (expected)  returns in the form of rents and increased  real estate value.  Often, however, such  developments are not considered as an  ‘ordinary’ real estate development.  City councils see local economic benefits  (jobs!, image!, innovation!) and are often  prepared to make a contribution, and  often, not-for-profit organisations are involved as well. This makes the development of a hotspot rather complex: there  is a plethora of interests and organisations including the municipality (various  departments), the university, private  firms, landowners, property developers, investors, housing corporations, development agencies etc.   
LIVING  APART TOGETHER?  CO-OPERATION BETWEEN CITY AND UNIVERSITY.  
In recent years, there is an intense de- bate about the relations between university and city.  from a local economic  development perspective ( oEcD, 2007),  it is repeatedly argued that universities  should align their research and education policies to the needs of the regional  economy, and engage more actively in  strategic relations with local companies.  Many city leaders tend to agree with this analysis, and try to urge universities to  do more for and in the city.   
MAKING THE CONNECTION : LINKING KNOWLEDGE HOTSPOTS TO THE CITY.   
In chapter 1, it was stated that a good  knowledge hotspot is a connected one.  This point is elaborated in this chapter. In the 1970s and 1980s, knowledge hotspots (science parks, technology parks, campuses) were  developed out of town, at greenfield locations, with  little communication links with the city cores. This trend has reversed. Many – not all! – new hotspots  are now developed in city quarters and  / or regenerated industrial areas, in an urban and lively ambience. This is particularly true for ‘creative’ hotspots.  The tenants – high tech firms, design firms, architect agencies, media companies, etc. – prefer environments with a distinct and urban identity. Their work culture is far beyond the 9  - 17 mentality, and  work and life are mixed up in time and space. People in these industries think and work in the logic of projects rather than fixed contracts with employers;  there are many freelancers working temporarily together, and they use bars, restaurants, gyms and  libraries as meeting places. They are often deeply  involved in cultural production and consumption,  and thrive in a lively and diverse urban environment. All over Europe and the US, worn-out urban  industrial sites have been transformed into lively  creative factories – often with substantial public  sector support –, and they have certainly contributed to the regeneration of many cities and districts. It’s not only about physical regeneration:  often, urban knowledge hubs are developed with  explicit social regeneration objectives in mind.  Thus, ‘new generation’ knowledge hubs are increasingly being developed as part of the urban   fabric rather than outside town, and they tend be more mixed in term of functions. Interestingly, this is not only true for hotspots for creative industries. There are several recent examples of technology-oriented urban knowledge quarters. The city of  newcastle (U k) is developing a  large science quarter in the heart of the city, and  in dortmund ( germany), a second generation  technology hub ‘Phoenix’ is being developed as  full part of a new urban neighbourhood, including  housing and leisure functions  (see http://www.phoenixdortmund.de/de/home/) The shift from the isolated campus model to integrated approaches has brought knowledge-based  development to the heart of Europe’s cities. This  ‘urban turn’ is a manifestation of a more general  re-appreciation of cities. knowledge workers increasingly prefer to work in a nice and lively working environment that offers amenities and facilities  beyond just office and lab space, and where consumption opportunities are more widely available  (Florida, 2002; Glaeser, consumer city). There is pressure on firms and research institutes to meet  these demands: skilled knowledge workers have  become a scarce commodity, and there is severe  competition to lure them. o ne of the ways to do  so, is to offer a very attractive working environment  that includes facilities for leisure and shopping. 
The challenge of integration. New urban knowledge hubs are places where  the new economy merges with the old, where  incoming ‘elitist’ knowledge workers mix with the  indigenous inhabitants, and where new architecture and structures blend with the existing urban  fabric. A major challenge for cities is to handle conflicts of interest and to integrate knowledge  hubs into the city in a sustainable way. Based on experience gained in the r EdIS-project and  other case studies, one may distinguish three  dimensions of integration: physical, social, and  economic. All three have to be taken into account  when developing an urban knowledge hotspot. Economic connections  refer to the links be - tween the knowledge hotspot and the local economy.  does the new development generate jobs  for locals or people in adjacent neighbourhood,  or only for the ‘creative class’ coming from else - where? To what extent does the new knowledge  hub offer interesting new business perspectives  for firms in the area, i.e. services firms, café’s,  restaurants? Can local firms use new facilities to  be developed there? Are local firms involved in  the project development process?  Social connections  refer to the social benefits  of a new hub for inhabitants of the area and the  city at large. w ill it generate relevant job openings for locals, or educational opportunities for  adults and children? Are there links with local  schools? h ow is the development affecting  the social fabric of the neighbourhood?  will  the development drive up prices of real estate  and replace poor inhabitants with more wealthy  ones? To what extent can the new facilities be  used for local community activities? In what ways  are citizens involved in the development stages  of the project? Do ordinary citizens benefit from  the development of the knowledge hub? 
how to improve ‘stand alone’  monofunctional campuses? 
Many cities still have (and develop) mono-function - al campus areas at their outskirts, typically technology parks or university campuses developed in the  past decades. There is an increasing awareness,  however, that campuses should become more  lively and vibrant places. University managers and  city planners increasingly believe that a certain  level of liveliness and diversity has a positive influence on the ‘success’ of science parks or any other  type of knowledge location (influenced by the ideas  of Jane Jacobs and richard Florida). Throughout  Europe we see efforts to make existing campuses  and technology parks more ‘urban’ and attractive. 28 new functions are added, like student housing, restaurants, sports facilities and shopping functions, to  make the area more interesting and lively. An - other common practice is to provide office space  for start-up companies and incubators. Typically, developments are driven by the real estate department of the university, that sees opportunities to optimize the economic use of the campus. one way to increase diversity is by  adding residential functions to an existing science location.  Indirectly, this can increase the liveliness of a knowledge location as well. residents generate  traffic and activity after office hours; they constitute  a market for other facilities (shops, bars, restaurants) in the area, from which tenants in the area  can benefit and which may attract people from out - side. A certain critical mass is needed to make this happen. Housing projects may target at specific groups (dormitories for students, expats, or other types of temporary knowledge workers), or, alter - natively, at any type of tenants/buyers. At newly planned knowledge sites, residential functions can  easily be added to knowledge locations: unlike  heavy industries, science and innovation activities  are not polluting or dangerous to the population  (although there are exceptions). The situation is different at ‘legacy’ monofunctional campuses or science parks. To add residential functions there, high investments are needed  (parks, basic amenities and services), and companies in the area may be worried about security, especially if the area used to be closed at night time.  depending on the situation, other functions could  be added to a knowledge location as well. obvious candidates are  leisure, tourism, and sports  facilities . These functions are adequate ‘network  facilitators’ and could enhance planned or spontaneous interaction. Moreover, they could be used by people outside the area as well. Again, adding functions is easier at a new site than at an existing  legacy site. In the city of Magdeburg, tourism is considered a catalyst to enhance the liveliness of  the science area. The cities’ ‘Science h arbor’ is located at an attractive location along the Elbe river,  that is suitable for activities like boating, or cycling. Through events, knowledge hotspots can temporarily be turned into very lively and vibrant places.  Each year, the city of Magdeburg organizes a  ‘long night of science’ in its Science  harbor area.  For one night, the research institutes open their doors to the general public, and organize all kinds of activities. These types of events have several positive effects: it may encourage young people to study science; it raises awareness of the local population, and it puts the area on the mental map as a place where interesting things happen. Events can help to change the identity of an area. In the city of Eindhoven, a new ‘art & design’ district is being developed, at old factory premises of Philips  (Strijp S). To make the area more known as a hip knowledge location, events are organized on-site that relate to the theme of the new quarter. Some lessons Clearly, there are no blueprints for an ‘optimal’  integration of knowledge hubs, as their development is highly context-specific. Especially for new developments, stakeholder  management is essential, and needs to go be - yond the ‘traditional’ approach of informing and  consulting citizens in the masterplanning process.  The transformational aspects of large knowledge- driven urban development plans require a deeper  involvement approach, that does not only address  the spatial and physical aspects of the development, but also the functional and conceptual  linkages between the new knowledge hub and the  city. Participation should not be organized as an occasional confrontation of professional planners  with ordinary citizens or business owners in the  design stage only, but as a continuing dialogue.  This may benefit the knowledge quarter in several ways, and contributes to its physical and  functional integration in the city as a whole. Also,  a smart participation approach increases the acceptance of knowledge hubs that would otherwise be considered by many residents as elitist  urban enclaves to which they have no relation. It is advisable to set up structures in which stake - holders are represented from the outset. They  serve as arena’s where conflicting interests are  addressed at an early stage, and where creative  solutions can be developed. As in the case of Dublin, the process may lead to a set of ‘development  guidelines’ that reflects (or reconciles) the different  interests and ambitions. In practice, some topics or conceptual areas could be identified in which participation is likely to add value: examples are the temporary use of the development site, or the potential links between science/ technology and citizen’s daily lives. To generate and elaborate ideas, working groups could be created, involving community representatives, relevant  university researchers, civil officers and members  of the delivery organization, and funding should be  made available to put the ideas into practice. In many places in Europe, 1970s-style suburban campuses were transformed into more diverse places, by adding all sorts of functions to the  campus (student housing, restaurants, amenities  etc.). This may make sense from the university’s perspective.  however, there is a tradeoff: this  development is at the expense of the liveliness of  the (inner) city, and reduces the demand there.  Students or researchers who otherwise would have  lived and consumed in the city, now spend their  time and money in the campus area. Policymakers must realise that the indirect costs of a less lively  (inner) city are substantial, with impacts on tourism,  image, and attractiveness for the creative class.

"REFILL.
Reuse of vacant spaces as driving Force for Innovation on Local Level.

PREFACE TO THE STATE OF THE ART.

Temporary use is entangled in a web of complex (private, public, associative) interests and issues at stake. The dichotomy between some of these motives, but especially the infancy of this topic on the agenda makes it important for city administration to question themselves, their urban planning and the way they can bring together interests which are at first sight diverging, in order to contribute to developing more integrated urban planning. At the same time focusing on this issue can have a strong economic, social, environmental and cultural potential for city development. More than that, such an approach questions the way cities are governed and the role city administration can play in meditating between the different stakeholders. As such, the REFILL network’s objectives are to investigate the way temporary use can contribute to a quest for new governance models to support temporary use: Exchange and evaluation of local supporting instruments; Ensure long lasting effects of temporality;  Build a more flexible, collaborative public administration. In this State of the Art, we outline the current situation of temporary use in Europe and its potential for urban planning and integrated governance: whether of vacant spaces or building, or of unused ones, the practice is outside the realm of traditional urban planning. Yet through its support of a range of economic, social, environmental and cultural values, some municipalities have developed a range of attitudes in order either to: enable and initiate them; to claim and coach them; or, to formalise and exploit them. At the EU level, the support has been mostly on brownfields whereas support or research on temporary use is still scattered. We have also sketched out the potential for temporary use to play an active role in triggering or influencing organizational shifts within city administrations. 
INTRODUCTION.
In the 50s’ film “Le chantier des gosses”, children were spending their leisure time in an abandoned lot in the very centre of the city of Brussels: this place was vacant, yet to be built. That was also in such a place the nephew of Tati’s My Uncle was eating donoughts and whistling at pedestrians so that they would bump into lamppost. These spaces were free of rules, a ground for fertile experimentation, individual empowerment and creativity development. European cities have evolved, we see less and less of these places yet to be transformed into modernized neighbourhoods of the city. However, new types of vacant spaces have emerged: these are buildings which have been abandoned as they do not fit with the evolving needs of companies and working practices, these are brownfields where heavy industries left deeply rooted pollution which makes impossible commercialization of these lands, these are leftovers from strong industrial pasts of some regions – in the form of buildings or abandoned lands, former docks, … All of these give a new face to European cities and create a potential for redynamisation through the realm of temporary activities which can take place on them. However, taking them into consideration in city governance is still recent, inexistent in some cities. Municipalities are yet to develop structures and frameworks which can enable taking advantage of their potential at most. As has been observed in many cities, such initiatives are strongly led by citizens and creative entrepreneurs. Society is changing, cities as well. Citizens are asking for greater involvement in city development. They are taking an increasingly important role in city governance, what questions the way cities are currently being governed. Temporary use of vacant places can be an entry point into a transitional organizational shift of governance, giving increasing room for manoeuvre to citizens.   
DEFINING TEMPORARY USE. 
1. Share of vacant spaces. 
Unused or vacant spaces can be those spaces left vacant during the formation of the city. However, the number of these is constantly decreasing and here we are rather concerned with spaces and buildings which were previously occupied and abandoned at some point. These can be called “Vacant Terrain” when we refer to the emptiness of the terrain compared to the surrounding built environment, and when it is not occupied by neither people nor construction and infrastructure. We would call them “Urban Wastelands, Brownfield, Derelict land, Degraded and Deteriorated land or buildings” when referring to abandoned spaces, without urban activity and in some occasions contaminated (Nefs 2006). However, identifying spaces and buildings which are not occupied is quite tricky. Indeed it is sometimes quite difficult to clarify what a “vacant” building or space is, not to mention different typologies from one research to another (Nefs 2006). In addition, the definition of what a vacant space or building is varying depending on the country. However, from the data that does exist, we can see that the percentage of conventional dwellings which is vacant ranges from the very low 1.7 % in Sweden to a third of the total dwelling in Greece. In a similar vein, the Guardian revealed in 2014 that 11 million homes were unoccupied across Europe: 3.4 million in Spain, 2 million in France and Italy, 1.8 million in Germany and more than 700,000 in the UK and in Portugal. This is in sharp contrast with the estimate that 4.1 million people would be homeless in the EU (Neate 2014). In Brussels, it is more than 10% of total offices that are vacant within the Brussels Capital Region, and 30% when taking into account the outskirts. In Amsterdam, it is 17% of the office space that is unoccupied (Böhlke 2013). To some authors, this not only causes problems in light of the increasing urban demographic growth and need for new housing but also to new economic developments. Indeed, all types of companies and institutions tend to replace their offices which are not fit to their needs moving to new ones and leaving the former ones behind. However, the design and techniques of the office building is evolving constantly leading to an acceleration of their obsolescence. For companies and institutions, it is about finding better, wellequipped, up-to-date spaces (Böhlke 2013). Such a neglect of vacant spaces and buildings also means greater urban sprawl and its consequences on urban planning and the environment. This share of vacant spaces and buildings is constantly increasing throughout Europe. The change in land and building occupation can be explained by economical changes such as the financial crisis, industrial and commercial restructuring, industrial changes, and new forms of entrepreneurship. Alternative forms of solidarity and commitment levels are arising. Society and organisation processes are also taking on new forms: office work is becoming more flexible, telework is expanding, public space is used differently and properties are developing multi-use facilities. This is increasingly the case in some sectors: in the creative industry, in culture and counterculture for example. Spatial needs are increasing, these activities search constantly for experimentation places, often developing some pioneer activities with a strong bottom-up impulse with the support of social innovations. New technologies contribute to these new dynamics through their speed and spread, supporting communicating and restructuring all forms of logistics. More details and examples are given in the remainder of this section. 
2. Values of temporary use. 
Temporary use has grown continuously since the 1950s and 1960s when the historical centres were abandoned and the peripheries started to expand. Squatter movements emerged in 1970s to take advantages of these vacant spaces and buildings and new forms of programmes and public-private cooperation were set up in the 1980s in order to transform docks and industrial areas into residential and office space. Since the following decade, there has been a trend to go back to downtowns which is strongly related to the operations of urban revitalisation, requalification, renovation and redevelopment dealing with unused terrains and buildings (Nefs 2006). Berlin is often put forward as the example of a city where temporary use had appeared to tackle vacant properties in the 1990s and 2000s in a city where dissent, alternative and underground culture was quite prominent (Colomb 2012). Temporary use is the activity taking place outside the ordinary functioning of the real estate market. It can be driven by creative milieus, activist and community uses, promoter of culture and counterculture, as new approaches to urban space, as form of consumerism or by private sector initiatives (SEEDS 2015). Temporary use is also dependent on the strategies for users, owners and intermediaries as presented in the table below. Temporary use, however, is not only about the use of vacant spaces and buildings. It can be a different use of a space or building during a limited period in time, usually in search for pop-up artistic or activist events. This is for example the case of the worldwide initiative PARK(ing) Day where groups of citizens create temporary parks on parking slots: while experimenting on new ways of interacting and creating a community bound, citizens seek to take back their city and to become proactive actors of their surroundings. Temporary uses provide opportunities for interaction, participation, and start-ups. They are also a new ground for urban planning and make a contribution to the sustainable design of urban change (Ziehl et al. 2012). Temporary use has been widely argued not only as the mere use of empty or vacant spaces or buildings, but also as being crucial in the development of new values for the cities: both as a “value of the use” (for the citizen using the available space ) and the “exchange value” (generating revenue for the benefice of the real estate business) (Nefs 2006). These can be of economic, social, environmental, or cultural nature. 
a. Economic value. Temporary use has a strong potential to develop the economic activities of a city, to create jobs and businesses, to develop skills, and to improve the attractiveness of spaces. It can do so by providing: (flexible and cheap) working spaces, networking spaces, and the centralization of activities (hubs). As such, temporary places can become urban catalysts or urban incubators. One such key example is the costefficient reuse of vacant properties when spaces have been empty for a while. On the one hand, this is in particular useful for real estate owners who seek an intermediary situation before renovation or buy out: with a given small investment, real estate owners can accommodate a temporary use for a limited period: they benefit from maintenance of their location at the same time as tenants benefit from a low rent. On the other hand, it provides start-up companies, community projects and social initiatives with a space to test their business and organisational models, as in a period of incubation. Such a concept has been promoted through the “Meanwhile Space”: while providing tools for partnerships between real estate owners, municipalities and citizens, it puts forward the mutual advantages that can be raised from a temporary use of empty buildings, as presented in its implementation in Craigavon, Ireland. Another economic potential is for temporary activities to serve the regeneration of given places or buildings. Through complementary projects, they can give a new life to abandoned places or buildings which can then go back to the market with a higher value. This was the case of a former hospital in Bologna. 
b. Social values. Creating or reinforcing social links, binding communities or social inclusion are essential to many temporary uses. They indeed provide space for meetings and activities in the neighbourhood and enable temporary housing. They can provide housing in the form of shelters for people in need of a roof such as refugees. They can also experiment on new ways of using the public space to create social bounds. Such a use can also go in the direction of mitigating social and economic conflicts about the fact that buildings which could be occupied are left vacant. The case box below presents the example of a day care centre which is taking place in a vacant building before a new one is built. This centre has become the central place for social care and community life in the neighbourhood. 
c. Environmental value. Occupying temporarily spaces and buildings can also contribute to improving urban public spaces and greens, preserving natural habitats and depolluting areas as well as promoting urban agriculture and local food. Indeed, especially when the places have been vacant before, they provide new ground for agriculture and recreation but especially for experimentation on those areas. This was for example the case of the “Hot Summer of Urban Farming” project in Copenhagen, Denmark, where artists sought new insights into urban agriculture and sustainable food. In addition, temporary use in itself is strongly concerned with the fact that the current paradigm of economic growth should be revisited: the incessant construction of buildings, creation of waste, isolation of workers and citizens, all these are taken at odds in many temporary use practices. Such practices also seek other opportunities for cities in order to optimise their existing resources. They can contribute to the future of “smart” or “compact” cities, if not by limiting the air pollution and noise (which would become increasingly concentrated) at least in the development of flexible public transports, new ways of consuming or new collaborative services. 
d. Cultural values. In many cases, temporary use is also strongly linked to the history of the city, mainly industrial history. Using these spaces enables cultivating the historical memory of the city and also to produce culture and develop creativity on the images provided by these spaces. Many initiatives are taking place in abandoned industrial or military sites, or even brownfields. Ground Control in Paris is specialised in organising ephemera events in a different location every year, shedding light onto some unknown places of the French capital, at the same time as providing alternative ground for night life. 
TEMPORARY USE AS A DRIVER FOR MUNICIPALITY SHIFTS. 
1. Temporary use’s experimentation power. 
Temporary use can sometimes be the ground of on-site dissent experimentations which take place on a vacant place without upfront agreement or permission. Such experimentations are a real-life trial of what a place could become, what would be realistic and feasible as well as what citizens and users would value. Such processes are often collaborative and participative and propose complementary and transferable approaches. These have a strong potential to support governance as they provide additional services to those proposed by municipalities in that they collaborate directly with citizens, they are citizen-driven, they take risks and make trials and errors about possible outcomes of given lands or buildings. Some municipalities have learnt to incorporate these outsiders’ inputs into their governance model. It was the case of Park Fiction in Hamburg, where an experimentation took place on a place originally foreseen for a real estate project and was later integrated in the neighbourhood development plan. Temporary use can also contribute to restoring buildings and spaces and to the renovation and regeneration of problematic neighbourhoods. New urban plans can emerge making temporary use a new way of managing empty buildings and spaces. Some governments are acknowledging the role temporary use can have on urban planning. The Danish Ministry of Social Affairs, for example, published a toolkit to identify area potentials through temporary uses, by using a space early in transformation process. Through an advanced brainstorming and collective projection in what a future area could become, the methodology provides architects, urban designers, planners, consultants, municipal officials, politicians and developers with a catalyser for the development of the area around the temporary use. These visions of the urban space, involve citizens, future residents and future users in order to create a dynamic between the traditional urban planning tools and space use. 
2. Municipalities’ adaptation to temporary use. 
The municipality of Amsterdam was seeking to encourage private owners of vacant spaces, residential properties and houses to use them for alternative uses for creative endeavours, stat-ups, and incubators. However, the municipality observed that it required involving both private companies and NGOs for adapting to local needs but also that these did not speak the same language. In addition, there were no follow-up of the projects in the administration (interest parties had to present their case each time all over again. As a result, the administration set up a full-time position for one civil servant to focus on transforming vacant spaces in 2000, responsible, amongst other to liaise and talk individually to all stakeholders (Polyak and Oravecz 2015). Indeed, temporary use of vacant places requires new forms of cooperation between public administration, private owners and citizens. It can be reinforced by an improved communication between owners and users, the building of a network, and the identification of existing resources and collection of data. This, in turn, requires a flexible legal framework, a fast decision making process, local sensibilisation and continuous integration of models (Elisei 2015). Creating a new infrastructure and ecosystem for temporary use is one of the key challenges to support it. At the same time, it is also an opportunities to develop new governance models for administrations. 
3. Temporary use’s influence on municipalities.
 The cases presented throughout this document highlighted the way municipalities have adapted the way they design and implement local policies in order to develop temporality of activities and to go beyond it. They have become collaborative, participatory, and flexible. They have also learnt to listen and react to grassroots movement and to open the city governance to outsiders. Temporary use can indeed have a strong impact on the changes within city governance: not only does the municipality need to adapt, but it can also be affected – positively - by these transformations. This corresponds to the current needs of cities to adapt to new needs, similarly to the administrative mismatch , mentioned in the “Cities of tomorrow” report “the administrative boundaries of cities no longer reflect the physical, social, economic, cultural or environmental reality of urban development and new forms of flexible governance are needed” (European Commission 2011). The same report also called for new evolutions in city governance, and in particular the need to: Deal with challenges in an integrated, holistic way; Match place- and people-based approaches; Combine formal government structures with flexible informal governance structures that correspond to the scale at which the challenges exist; Develop governance systems capable of building shared visions reconciling competing objectives and conflicting development models; Cooperate in order to ensure coherent spatial development and an efficient use of resources; New governance modes based on citizens' empowerment, participation of all relevant stakeholders and innovative use of social capital are needed; and, In the context of weakened links between economic growth and social progress, social innovation offers an opportunity to widen the public space for civic engagement, creativity, innovation and cohesion (European Commission 2011). Temporary use indeed plays a key role in cities as it can accommodate innovation and adapt needs and capacities to available resources (Patti and Polyak 2015b). It fosters networks and co-creation dynamics. It also provides new roles for the concerned stakeholders. Civil servants are becoming matchmakers and coordinators. The owners of the lands or buildings and the users of these areas become in turn providers of services or of solutions to the others’ problem (e.g. ensuring maintenance of an empty space and using a space at affordable price). Temporary use is a tool which proposes new framework for interaction with stakeholders. It brings a variety of stakeholders together. It provides feedbacks to the administrations concerning what the necessities are in the neighbourhoods and what the capacities to provide those needs are. It also sheds light as to where city administration needs to communicate and create synergies. Finally, it can create more sustainable management models as increasing community energies are involved (Patti and Polyak 2015c).

"RegGov
Regional Governance of Sustainable Integrated Development of Deprived Urban Areas

Context and main objectives of RegGov. Nine partners from eight countries have participated in the URBACT network RegGov – Regional Governance of Sustainable Integrated Development of Deprived Urban Areas. All partners have produced and submitted integrated and sustainable Local Action Plans, making use of the opportunity of a transnational network with peer reviews and the establishment of Local Support Groups. The URBACT programme encourages the cooperation between partners from European cities and the Managing Authorities of the Operational Programmes in order to link local urban policies with the Operational Programmes. The main challenges of the RegGov network have been the fostering of sustainable and integrated urban and neighbourhood development policies and the creation of participatory processes in policy-making and policy implementation. The RegGov network focuses on the role of cooperation and integration at and between different administrative levels for multiply- deprived urban neighbourhoods dealing particularly with the following question: How can an efficient model and good forms of governance in integrated neighbourhood development be established and implemented in order to achieve successful and sustainable integrated neighbourhood regeneration? Allowing for a lasting and efficient “horizontal cooperation” between all relevant actors on the local level and making sure that all relevant key players, associations and organisations contribute to the development and implementation of Integrated Local Action Plans, so that all possible resources are activated and integrated and all possible synergies are realised. With a special focus on the question of how to achieve improved and more reliable forms of “vertical cooperation” – from the neighbourhood across the city level to the level of Managing Authorities. This topic has received special significance through the mainstreaming of the urban dimension in European policy – creating regional authorities all over Europe with a new and decisive responsibility in the field of integrated urban and neighbourhood development. The RegGov network has been working in this field for three years, developing, testing and disseminating new models of good governance through the creation of Local Support Groups and the development of integrated Local Action Plans in nine Partner Cities in eight Member States of the European Union. The European Commission has assigned the Fast Track Label to the RegGov network, which is an additional incentive for a particularly close cooperation between the Cities and their Managing Authorities when elaborating Local Action Plans. 
Primary results.
Governance is the core element of all integrated development and regeneration strategies and programmes. The main objective is to improve the horizontal and vertical cooperation, and to provide all regional and local actors with the know-how and tools to develop and implement neighbourhood regeneration strategies. The strategic involvement and cooperation can help create a stronger sense of motivation and responsibility among all involved actors – for the development, implementation and funding of regeneration strategies. Regional governance is an issue that has not been recognised as crucial for a long time. The concentration on neighbourhood development issues from a local perspective is already a challenging field, with needs of highly professional and complex work, but it can only be the first step and must be embedded into a broader context. Action fields which are of importance for neighbourhood development usually extend beyond the boundaries of a quarter or neighbourhood. The perspective has to include all necessary levels, taking into account all relative competences and interrelationships. In addition to the promotion and support of projects for deprived neighbourhoods based on integrated local action plans and schemes, one very important issue still remains unclear in many cases: how to establish long-term perspectives of structures developed within limited projects, and how to define the role and potentials of civic actors in these strategic consolidation processes. The following strategic principles of action have been developed: Integrated development and action planning ; Bundling of resources ;  Neighbourhood management ; Participation and activation of inhabitants ; Accompanying monitoring and evaluation of the effects. The challenge is to motivate and activate local communities and citizens to take an active role in the improvement of their housing and living conditions. The RegGov network has tested new organisational and financial tools and creative methods of participation. This expands the capacity of cooperation between the public sector and the local communities. RegGov has developed comprehensive local partnerships with all relevant actors who can contribute to the success of a regeneration or development strategy. National/regional institutions, urban key players and local stakeholders are part of Local Support Groups in each Partner City. The following main elements of vertical governance have been identified within the common work: Culture of cooperation ; Reciprocal trust ; New communication structures ;  Learning process for all partners Vertical integration is crucial because it can provide political and strategic support. It can supply advice on how to bundle different programs and funding opportunities. The challenge is to overcome policies delivered through vertical “silos” which are mirrored in sector programme structures. The coordination of sector policy areas needs to be improved. This is also a question of effectiveness in terms of neighbourhood regeneration. A higher regional level can resource a larger number of neighbourhoods. Furthermore, the Managing Authorities need the cities to fulfil the objectives they have developed in the Operational Programmes. This is why the MA should create a platform for the cities focussing on good applications as they relate to their programmes. This is a question of governance and of direct and trustful co-operation, based on an analysis of the interests of the involved stakeholders. 
Ten Recommendations
Challenges and Conditions of Good Multi-Level Governance
Strengthening regional governance from the bottom to the top: No local projects without integrated city-wide strategies. Integrated urban development: Area-based and cross-sector approaches. Activating and enabling inhabitants: Short-term successes and long-term visions. City networking: Give institutions a face and build up mutual trust. Coalition-building: Cooperation as a principle of work. Physical and infrastructure investments: Linked to socially integrative activities. Monitoring at all involved levels: Early warning system and seismograph of results. Special funding programmes: A chance for social innovation input in mainstream policy. Bundling where necessary: Stronger integration on programme level. Urban agenda: Strong role of cities in the next EU funding period. 
1. Introduction
During the course of more than two decades, the European Union has been active in urban development, in particular in the field of urban regeneration. This has been institutionally recognised with the Community Initiatives URBAN, the Urban Dimension of the ERDF and the URBACT programme providing financial support and incentives to the integrated approach in the development of European cities and their policies. The URBACT programme encourages the cooperation between city partners and the Managing Authorities of the Operational Programmes in order to link local urban policies with the Operational Programmes. 
In the 2007 “Leipzig Charter on Sustainable European Cities”, all EU Member States’ Ministers responsible for Urban Development committed themselves to the principles of integrated urban development. The definition given in this intergovernmental policy document reflects the European perspective. “We recommend that European cities consider drawing up integrated urban development programmes for the city as a whole. These implementation- oriented planning tools should ; describe the strengths and the weaknesses of cities and neighbourhoods based upon an analysis of the current situation, ; define consistent development objectives for the urban area and develop a vision for the city ; coordinate the different neighbourhood, sectoral and technical plans and policies, and ensure that the planned investments will help to promote a well-balanced development of the urban area ; coordinate and spatially focus the use of funds by public and private sector players and ; be co-ordinated at local and city-regional level and involve citizens and other partners who can contribute substantially to shaping the future economic, social, cultural and environmental quality of each area. Co-ordination at local and city-regional level should be strengthened. An equal partnership between cities and rural areas as well as between small, medium-sized and large towns and cities within city-regions and metropolitan regions is the aim.” (Leipzig Charter 2007) The main challenges of the RegGov network have been the fostering of sustainable and integrated urban and neighbourhood development policies and the creation of participatory processes in policy-making and policy implementation. The RegGov network focuses on the role of cooperation and integration at and between different administrative levels for multiply- deprived urban neighbourhoods dealing particularly with the following question: How can an efficient model of good governance in integrated neighbourhood development be developed and implemented in order to achieve successful and sustainable integrated neighbourhood regeneration? The RegGov network has been working in this field for three years, developing, testing and disseminating new models of good governance through the creation of Local Support Groups (LSG) and the development of integrated Local Action Plans (LAP) in nine partner cities in eight Member States of the European Union. All partners have produced and submitted integrated and sustainable Local Action Plans, making use of the opportunity of a transnational network with peer reviews and the installation of Local Support Groups. 
Main aspects highlighted in the report.
Co-production of Local Action Plans for deprived urban neighbourhoods.
The Local Support Groups installed in all Partner Cities have contributed to anchoring the integrated approach in co-production of the LAP and to creating a broad consensual platform on the neighbourhood development throughout the city. The variety of stakeholders involved in the LSG stresses the need to specifically identify the“right” constellation of groups and persons involved for each neighbourhood. At the same time, it is the pre-condition for a local consensus and co-production on par with each other. 
Fields of governance: Integrated neighbourhood development in practice.
Within the thematic work of RegGov, selected examples from all partners have been produced. They illustrate the integrated approach in practice, with specific locally based questions, challenges and solutions, but all include transfer potentials to other situations. 
General conclusions: Ten Recommendations for Regional Governance.
A synthesis from the RegGov exchange and its work will be given in the final chapter: What are the lessons learnt? What are the needs and perspectives for the next structural funding period (2014-2020) to improve urban policy interests at EU level? What should be put on the Urban Agenda in terms of a more efficient cohesion policy in the future period?  
1.1 Network Issues and Questions.
The main issue of the RegGov network is the question of how good forms of governance can be established in integrated urban and neighbourhood development: ; allowing for a lasting and efficient “horizontal cooperation” between all relevant actors on the local level and making sure that all relevant key players, associations and organisations contribute to the development and implementation of integrated Local Action Plans, so that all possible resources are activated and integrated and all possible synergies are realised ; with a special focus on the question of how better and more reliable forms of “vertical cooperation – from the neighbourhood across the city level to the level of Managing Authorities – can be achieved. This topic has received particular significance through the mainstreaming of the urban dimension in European policy – creating regional authorities across Europe with a new and decisive responsibility in the field of integrated urban and neighbourhood development. The following guiding questions have been posed as a starting point of reflection within the network: How to develop long-term integrated Action Plans and the necessary related financial planning for the sustainable regeneration of deprived urban neighbourhoods?  How to monitor progress and achievements in integrated neighbourhood regeneration as a tool for local decision-makers as well as Managing Authorities? How to establish and maintain comprehensive and sustainable partnerships for integrated neighbourhood regeneration?  How can good forms of governance and vertical cooperation for integrated urban development planning be developed and maintained between cities and their regional authorities?  How can good forms of regional exchange, learning and cooperation in the field of integrated urban regeneration between cities in European regions be developed and maintained? How can representatives of the private sector as well as the local communities and their associations be successfully integrated into efficient governance models and the development as well as implementation of integrated Local Action Plans? How can the most excluded groups in our urban societies – e.g. members of the Roma communities – be integrated into the social, cultural and economic life of their cities by using participation processes as a starting point for their re-integration? How can efficient citywide monitoring and evaluation systems be developed and applied in order to allow local policy and administration to intervene at an early stage in neighbourhoods which are at risk of degradation and social exclusion? 
1.2 Common Challenges and Objectives.
Regional and multi-level governance for the development of deprived urban neighbourhoods means an integrated approach of steering development processes. One of the first steps is to reflect on the term “governance”. The essence of this term lies in the broad interpretation of the respective constellations of stakeholders, levels and sectors involved. Etymologically, the origin of the notion “governance” is from the nautical language – in Greek, the verb kyberman, and in Latin, gubernare. In both cases it has to do to with the navigation of a ship. However, already Plato used the Greek word in the metaphoric sense of governing people. Since the 14th century the word “governance” in English is used to mean manner of governing. The linguistic relationship between government and governance reveals the link and interaction between political-administrative steering and social self-regulation. Governance in the Anglo- Saxon context is used within a broad range of governing, from the local to the global level. It includes enterprises and policy networks, and is also used to describe entire policy fields or economic sectors (cf. Botzem 2002, 16). Integrated urban regeneration is one of the fields in which manifold challenges need to be tackled. Horizontal and vertical cooperation are necessarily linked. On the one hand, focusing only on horizontal relationships within the cities and neighbourhoods would ignore the importance of the regional, national and supranational framework as a black box, although crucial policy conditions for acting at local level have been identified at all levels. On the other hand, the RegGov network has been working to elaborate this issue of multi-level interrelations in order to give more attention to local development, in particular in urban areas. In the European Fifth Cohesion Report published in November 2010, the importance of the urban dimension within the EU 2020 strategy (European Commission 2010a) has been confirmed, but it still needs to be specified further: “Urban problems, whether related to environmental degradation or to social exclusion, call for a specific response and for direct involvement of the level of government concerned. Accordingly, an ambitious urban agenda should be developed where financial resources are identified more clearly to address urban issues and urban authorities would play a stronger role in designing and implementing urban development strategies.“ (European Commission 2010b, XXIX) 
1.3 Experiencing the Integrated Urban Development Approach: the RegGov Network.
The European Commission has assigned the Fast Track Label to the RegGov network, which is an additional incentive for a particularly close cooperation between the Partner Cities and their Managing Authorities when elaborating Local Action Plans. In terms of expectations from DG REGIO towards Fast Track Networks, fostering cooperation between Managing Authorities and Cities is one of the most relevant expectations:  to establish regular exchange with cities and Local Support Groups ;  to help feed the key lessons learnt from the network into the strategic reporting and to contribute with input for the 5th Cohesion Report ;  to help ensure the implementation of Local Action Plans ; to actively capitalise on experience and practice ; to put high emphasis on active communication and dissemination. The exchange and the knowledge transfer in the RegGov network have been guaranteed by a continuous and intensive support within plenary Thematic Seminars and focused Thematic Clusters on four identified topics of partner cities and their Managing Authorities (cf. Timeline with RegGov meetings in the annex). 
RegGov Thematic Clusters.
New forms of regional cooperation in integrated neighbourhood regeneration. The involvement of private sector and community representatives in efficient governance models for the regeneration of deprived urban neighbourhoods. The integration of Roma population and other disadvantaged groups into the social, cultural and economic life of their cities. The function of city-wide monitoring systems and evaluation for the development in urban neighbourhoods. Building networks at (or between) different levels turns out to be crucial, especially for deprived neighbourhoods. The general set-up of cooperation differs from one partner to the next. The framework conditions of the RegGov partners, when discussing regional cooperation, are diverse:  Partners with different cultural backgrounds and traditions of regional cooperation and planning ; Convergence and competitiveness areas with different socio-economic conditions ; Institutional backgrounds: 8 countries with different State structures and administrative systems ; Different dimensions, sizes and different types of cities (in agglomeration, polycentric or monocentric, e.g. capital regions, with rural surroundings etc.).

Ten Recommendations.
Challenges and Conditions of Good Multi-Level Governance.

Strengthening regional governance from the bottom up: No local projects without integrated city-wide strategies.
  The learning process within the RegGov network showed the importance of embedding the neighbourhood plans in city-wide schemes in order to create a political-strategic support. Local Support Groups have been established within the URBACT programme and have been confirmed as a strong element in capacity building, but they should be built with a focus on the link between neighbourhood and city-wide master plans and strategies.  
Integrated urban development: Area-based and cross-sector approaches.  
There should be a continuous link between all stakeholders and scales of intervention. Public, private and civic actors have to agree upon strategic cross-sector priority areas, including social, economic and environmental factors. All activities and funding should be focused on these intervention areas, taking into account neighbouring areas and a broader scope. The creation of major acceptance and good public relations (local press) signify very important forms of support.  
Activating and enabling inhabitants: Short-term successes and long-term visions. 
Within an integrated perspective, a long-term view has to be developed, but it must be complemented by the principle of small steps and small successes. This is a highly motivating factor for inhabitants, and fosters their willingness to participate actively in further activities in their neighbourhood. This can be supported at the MA level with a two-step decision-making procedure: first, by submitting short proposals and receiving a positive response on funding opportunities, before subsequently investing large amounts of time and workload into applications. Less bureaucracy and more work in the deprived neighbourhoods – these are the overall objectives.  
City networking: Give institutions a face and foster mutual trust.  
The creation of networks between programme areas in cities and regions as learning communities has a clear added value for capacity-building within the local programmes and strategies in the individual cities. At the same time, the continual transfer of information creates an open climate of cooperation based on mutual trust, stretching from the neighbourhood level right up to the Managing Authority.  
Coalition-building: Cooperation as a principle of work.  
The cooperation between Managing Authorities and cities as well as regional cooperation between cities are preconditions for a successful and efficient implementation of urban renewal projects. In many cases capacity-building is still needed to become partners. The Managing Authorities should have a good and up-to-date insight in projects at city level. This is central in order to obtain a balanced and efficient use of public funding related to the overall development objectives.   
Physical and infrastructure investments: Linked to socially integrative activities.
  Within RegGov, the foundation for further activities has been laid by three years of intensive work with the involvement of the local community. The participative and socially integrative work and the involvement of the residents are persuasive factors and have to be communicated to the Managing Authorities, so that they can also be adapted to other funding programmes. This kind of involvement of residents should be obligatory and included for structural funds projects with a certain amount of funding in the different programmes.  
Monitoring at all involved levels: Early warning system and seismograph of results.  
On the one hand, monitoring systems are useful as an early warning system for other neighbourhoods with upcoming problems, which can begin to learn from the development in deprived urban neighbourhoods. On the other hand, in the Operational Programmes there should be control stations to monitor aspects such as long-term urban development policy and sustainability. 
Special funding programmes: A chance for social innovation input in mainstream policy.
  It is a long-term and complex process to build up trust and stable neighbourhood structures. The integrated approach in shortduration projects is not the only universal truth. The right time and the right topic must also be identified, and the specific integrated approach for the local context must be chosen. As long as the integrated approach relies only on additional funds, they remain transitory. Instead of “phasing out”, solutions should be found for retaining sustainable neighbourhood management structures for a longer period (from single projects to mainstreaming).  
Bundling where necessary: Stronger integration at programme level.
 More knowledge about funding programmes should be provided, and more possibilities should be offered for cross-financing in the Local Action Plans, e.g. between ERDF and ESF. There should be a tight coherence between Operational Programmes at national and regional levels. Managing Authorities should consult municipalities to get informed about their experiences before setting up the rules at the upper levels.  
Urban agenda: The strong role of cities in the next EU funding period.  
The EU 2020 strategy foresees a coordinated strategic approach. Of key importance, not only for deprived urban neighbourhoods, will be the identification of aspects related to cohesion policy that can be tackled mainly at local level. A stronger role for cities in implementing cohesion policy and strengthening the urban dimension will be required. But this cannot be done by the cities on their own. From a governance perspective, the additional value of a broad platform of stakeholders, both public and private, who are involved at all relevant levels and bundle their findings and experiences, is too often underestimated. This, however, is crucially important, not only at the city level, but also for programmatic enhancements at all levels.

"REPAIR.
Realising the Potential of Abandoned Military Sites as an Integral part of Sustainable Urban Community Regeneration.

INTRODUCTION.
 The withdrawal of the military presence from an urban area can happen suddenly, leading to extremely adverse socio-economic circumstances. This notably concerns small and medium sized urban areas where historically the military presence has dominated economic activity, providing much direct and indirect employment. These former military sites have excellent potential to act as the catalyst for urban socio-economic regeneration. Many of these sites consist of historic buildings, which may be considered critical assets. The challenge is to transform these abandoned military heritage sites into thriving sources of economic activity, employment and social cohesion. Our project will transfer identified good practice in the socio-economic re-use of military heritage sites and mainstreaming it to enable new regional development projects in other areas. Partner cities in the REPAIR Thematic Network share a common characteristic. The “sense of place” and identity has been shaped by significant presence of large swathes of military heritage buildings and sites, which military authorities have abandoned. The partners also share the major challenge of how to deliver the successful socio-economic and sustainable re-use of this abandoned military heritage so that it not only achieves economic competitiveness, in line with “Lisbon” and “Gothenburg” goals. The sites within the partner cities are a mixture of military installations from medieval to modern built heritage. The latter systems have witnessed recent de-militarisation. Demilitarisation in the late twentieth century left a significant social and economic vacuum caused because the local economies were often dependent on military presence with the effect of mini “command” economies. These changes have left significant residual poverty and a lack of opportunity amongst the local populations, which is a major threat to sustainable urban development. These heritage sites have fallen into disuse, decay and disrepair, making little contribution to economic competitiveness or social cohesion. The extensive redundant military sites represent a considerable obstacle to sustainable urban development. Repair partner cities have already responded to sustainable adaptive reuse methodologies in line with the Gothenburg and Lisbon Agendas. This demonstrates the successful socio-economic re-use of these military heritage sites. The major policy development challenge still to be addressed is to address successful spin-offs for broader sustainable urban development. The Urbact II Operational Programme emphasises the high priority placed by New Member States on the “reuse of wasteland used for military purposes” and this provides an extensive opportunity for partners to test the methodology developed and ability to access funding sources. The topic for our project is the realization of the potential of abandoned military sites as an Integral part of Sustainable Urban Community Regeneration and to illustrate the reasons why it is important that we address the issues and how we plan to achieve success in this field through best practice. It is crucial that the socio-economic re-use of military sites can catalyse the broader sustainable development of the broader urban area. The definition of specific policy frameworks to provide clear direction towards the realization of this goal is also vital if sustainable urban development is to be at the heart of the drive by urban areas across the EU to achieve the social and economic restructuring of their abandoned military sites. Furthermore, there needs to be an intense dialogue with local level policy makers and regeneration practitioners in the REPAIR network partner areas in order to transpose these pioneering new policy frameworks into practical regeneration actions, where the socio-economic re-use of military sites can directly deliver sustainable urban development. 
European Overview. 
Key drivers and trends in EU. 
A growing population, movement of people between areas and the search for employment brought about by changes in economic circumstances has led to a need to identify additional land or buildings for re-development in cities and regions across Europe. The availability of abandoned military land and buildings and heritage assets varies from one country to another however this stock does represent a source of potential development. Recent trends show much greater attention to rehabilitation of military areas than in the past. These sites are being re-utilised in the re-establishment of the public realm and to counter the negative influence communication technology, which has reduced community life. The need in Europe to rehabilitate the public realm is seen as a key to “glue” elements of fragmented cities, alienated communities and excluded neighbourhoods. Post WWII and post cold war military sites had a significant impact on aspects of local areas economic, social and environmental. The issues through demilitarization include; higher unemployment, lower incomes and the degradation and contamination. These necessitate immediate remedial solutions. However the military and heritage sites, which were located in strategically important locations, have been re-evaluated and regained their importance to a region or city. These sites with the various assets, the surrounding landscape and context have added value not only with a sense of place or non-use values but as new socio-economic drivers for the city; international tourism, sports leisure and recreation. This has resulted in a better quality of life for local communities. 
EU policy development. 
The EU has over the last decade developed active urban policies to resolve the impact generated by urban development and the setting up of parameters for sustainable urban development. Through the Noordwijk meeting in 1997 the Dutch Presidency promoted the advancement of policies contributing towards urban development at all levels. The United Kingdom launched in 1998 the Urban Exchange Initiative (UEI), which set out in an informal non-binding framework, key principles for urban policies drawn from the analysis of good practice presented by the Member States. These founding initiatives were consolidated by the subsequent Presidencies. These Urban Spatial Policies have been broadly interpreted to include the development of former military and heritage sites as many are situated within city boundaries. The Lisbon Strategy (2000) set a strategy to make the EU ""the most dynamic and competitive knowledge-based economy in the world capable of sustainable economic growth with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion, and respect for the environment by 2010"". A review programme was undertaken in 2004 to give a new impetus to the process. The European Commission used this report as a basis for its proposal in February 2005 to refocus the Lisbon Agenda on actions that promote growth and jobs in a manner that is fully consistent with the objective of sustainable development. The Commission's report stated that ""making growth and jobs the immediate target goes hand in hand with promoting social or environmental objectives."" In its resolution on the mid-term review of the Lisbon strategy in March 2005, the European Parliament expressed its belief that ""sustainable growth and employment are Europe's most pressing goals and underpin social and environmental progress"" and ""that well-designed social and environmental policies are themselves key elements in strengthening Europe's economic performance"". In its resolution on the mid-term review of the Lisbon strategy in March 2005, the European Parliament expressed its belief that ""sustainable growth and employment are Europe's most pressing goals and underpin social and environmental progress"" and ""that well-designed social and environmental policies are themselves key elements in strengthening Europe's economic performance"". The Gothenburg European Council (2001) completed the Lisbon strategy by adding an environmental dimension. It focussed on a new emphasis aimed at protecting the environment and to achieve a more sustainable pattern of development. It set out key environmental objectives and target dates at strategic, political and legislative levels, taking account of international agreements. The Gothenburg European Council agreed on these four priorities: Climate change: Reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, Kyoto targets. Progress towards electricity generated from renewable sources. Sustainable transport: Decoupling gross domestic product from transport growth. Tackling rising traffic volumes, congestion, noise and pollution. Encouraging the use of and investment in environmentally friendly transport and related infrastructure. Public health: Respond to citizens' concerns regarding food safety, the use of chemicals, infectious diseases and antibiotic resistance. Resource management: Decoupling resource use and the generation of waste from growth. The Bristol Accord (2005) recognised that Sustainable Communities are diverse and reflect their local circumstances and there is no standard template to fit them all but should be: ACTIVE, INCLUSIVE AND SAFE – Fair, tolerant and cohesive with a strong local culture and other shared community activities. WELL RUN – with effective and inclusive participation, representation and leadership. WELL CONNECTED – with good transport services and communication linking people to jobs, schools, health and other services. WELL SERVED – with public, private, community and voluntary services that are appropriate to people’s needs and accessible to all. ENVIRONMENTALLY SENSITIVE – providing places for people to live that are considerate of the environment. THRIVING – with a flourishing, diverse and innovative local economy. WELL DESIGNED AND BUILT – featuring quality built and natural environment. FAIR FOR EVERYONE – including those in other communities, now and in the future. The successive developments of EU Sustainable Development policy have led to a comprehensive background to be considered when applied to the development of Military and Heritage sites. EU member states adopted the Leipzig Charter (2007) on sustainable European cities, which was hailed as an ""additional motivation for an integral approach to urban development."" 
CURRENT SITUATION AND FUTURE PERSPECTIVES. 
The Leipzig charter has been a major step in the development of EU policy vis-à-vis the urban dimension. The charter states that all dimensions of sustainable development should be taken into account at the same time and with the same weight. These include economic prosperity, social balance and a healthy environment. The proposed policies include making greater use of an integrated approach in creating high-quality public spaces, modernising infrastructure, and proactive innovation. EU Sustainable Development Strategy is expected to undergo continual review but at present the overarching framework provides a solid platform and direction to support development of former military and heritage sites. 
SUMMARY. 
The current EU policies on sustainable development serve well to guide the REPAIR Thematic Network. They are closely reflected in the project activities, implementation strategies and planned outputs on national and local levels. The main issue to be addressed by the Repair topic is the the re-use and revitalisation of abandoned military heritage sites with successful socio-economic outcomes, taking into account the Lisbon, Gothenburg Agenda’s and Leipzig Charter to act as a catalyst to deliver sustainable urban development in small and medium sized cities. The task of reaching Sustainable Development is the most difficult one but perhaps it is just as difficult to reach agreement on the meaning of Sustainable Development. The discussions of the Project Partners led to four themes that will underpin the direction we take in approaching the redevelopment in each area. These themes are know as “The Four Pillars” and consist of: Preservation - How to develop alternative site uses and techniques, which best secure the long term preservation of the military heritage; Energy & Waste - how to achieve the sustainable re-use of the built heritage and heritage sites, through maximising energy efficiency, the better management of waste production, energy consumption and greater use of renewable energies; Transport - How to maximise access to military sites by sustainable modes of transport, which minimise car use and decouple transport growth from local GDP growth; Local Jobs - How the socio-economic re-use of the sites can maximise local jobs for local people and therefore sustainable communities and greater social cohesion. By considering each of these pillars in depth and by bringing together the conclusions in an overall working group where will consider the findings in the light of current Sustainable Development policy, we hope to produce effective policy recommendations to influence EU and local Policy Makers. 
THE SYNTHESIS.
 Realising the Potential of Abandoned Military Sites as an Integral part of Sustainable Urban Community Regeneration Successful planning in line with EU Sustainable Development Strategy. 
INTRODUCTION. 
The topic of the Repair network is the realisation of the potential of abandoned military heritage sites as an integral part of sustainable urban community regeneration. The sites in question vary considerably but often have a place at the heart of society; some sites are more remote and some situated in beautiful landscape but are valued for these features and there tends to be a social attachment for all of them. As a result, these military heritage sites fit into the definition of cultural heritage provided by Wikipedia, which is that (""national heritage"" or just ""heritage"") is the legacy of physical artifacts and intangible attributes of a group or society that are inherited from past generations, maintained in the present and bestowed for the benefit of future generations. Cultural Heritage includes therefore includes: Places of historical significance; places of aesthetic prominence; places of social importance; places of public importance and places of scenic distinction. Christopher Tunnard, Canadian born landscape architect said that it is the responsibility of Society to select what is significant, nurture and enhance it and make improvements. Each society must pass on to the next generation an environment that is enriched, more fulfilling and more beautiful. Preserving the past in general provides tremendous benefits to a city and its population. It has become increasingly important to enact legislation to distribute the costs and benefits of preservation more equitably and today’s strategies and policy frameworks should find ways to make the cultural heritage an integral part of daily life. However, there is a down side to ownership of a property especially where real estate tax on renovated or improved property is increased, for example. The price is even higher if one owns a landmark or historic building because frequently public officials impose extra requirements that add to the cost of the renovation. It is not inspiring to own and restore historic structures in such countries. Socio-economic re-use of abandoned military sites and historic preservation of these areas cannot and should not take place in a vacuum. This activity must involve improvements to the quality, condition and character of our air and water; our parks and public spaces; our streets and roads; education we provide to our children; the health care we provide the sick and the character of our built and natural environment. All of these actions should be integrated into the planning, budgeting and governance of every community! It is often true that the funds and efforts necessary to restore and re-use abandoned military sites, usually large sections of cities (block of streets, neighbourhood or districts) exceed the financial and administrative resources of most individuals and civic groups. Consequently, the community turns to the government to safeguard this heritage, but governments are generally in a poor position to maintain the abandoned military sites and in many Constitutions the government may be required to compensate property owners when it takes land or buildings for public use. Most cities are unwilling or unable to spend extraordinary resources to acquire military sites and buildings for the purpose of preservation; however cities in some countries get such sites from their states with no charge. This is where Public and Private partnerships can bring innovative ideas for the profitable and optimal re-use of the built heritage sites with a twofold effect: a. by providing for the general welfare of the site itself and b. offering a new lease of life or context for the site in the future. The alternative to re-use is demolition and once such structures of special significance are demolished, they are gone forever. Protection of this resource provides citizens with a profound connection to their culture and their history it also provides a physical link between their past and their future. 
PLANNING TO FOUR PILLARS AS ELEMENTS OF A SUCCESSFUL LOCAL ACTION PLAN. 
During the Development Phase of REPAIR the Project Partners participated in 3 workshops aimed at defining the main topic, and the connection between individual Partner’s military areas and the importance of 4 main Pillars (Preservation, Energy & Waste, Transport, Jobs) to be elaborated in Mini Local Action Plans (LAPs) during the Implementation Phase. The 4 Mini LAPs will serve as a base for devising Main Local Action Plans for each Project Partner. This approach will lead to achieving EU expectations regarding the Sustainable Development Strategy. 
SYNTHESIS - FROM PLANNING TO FOUR PILLARS AS ELEMENTS OF SUCCESSFUL LOCAL ACTION PLANS. 
The composition of Partners in REPAIR and the variety in the abandoned military sites presented in the Network is a great asset of the Project and contributes to its uniqueness The table above shows that despite the differences in the type of the military sites, the aims and re-use functions to be brought to the sites overlap. Therefore the starting point for the Project was to systemize the contexts, learning experience, and potentials of the Partners by illustrating common denominators, interrelations and levels of re-use actions. For this purpose three workshops were run during the Development Phase and were aimed at presenting and delineating the main topics, the connection between individual Partner’s military areas and the importance of 4 main Pillars (Preservation, Energy & Waste, Transport and Jobs) in order to formulate the Work Plan for the Implementation Phase. Objective 2 “Exchange and learning activities – the policy framework” actions 2.3 – 2.6 of the Work Plan specify that all Project Partners will contribute to the four Main Pillar Working Groups to be set up within the Network and will nominate representatives for their Urbact Local Support Groups (ULSG) to participate along with their Managing Authorities. Each Partner will produce four Mini Local Action Plans (LAPs), which will serve as a base for devising Main Local Action Plans for each Project Partner (Objective 3 “Impact on local policies”, Action 3.2. of the Work Plan). This approach will lead to achieving EU expectations regarding Sustainable Development Strategy. Three workshops were undertaken as peer review discussions where all partners attended. 
Working Group 1 was devoted to the aspect of “Realising the potential of abandoned military sites through the analysis of characteristic features of partners’ military areas as elements of successful planning”. It allowed characterizing each military site of the Network according to six main elements of successful planning strategy (market, location, design, financing, entrepreneurship and time). The objective of the analysis was to compare the sites and to define the elements to be taken into account when formulating LAPs by ULSGs in connection to the Four Pillars. Also, the findings of Workshop 1 can serve as grounds for the selection of two pilot locations to benefit from Pilot Regeneration Actions specified in the Work Plan Objective 6 Pilot Regeneration Actions, actions 6.1 – 6.4). 
Working Group 2 was dedicated to “Realising the Potential of Abandoned Military Sites through the analysis of possible re-use of partners’ military areas and their interrelation to main 4 pillars as elements of Local Action Plans”. Its aim was to identify key expectations of Partners in the context of the planned re-use processes, as well as to recognize the level of interrelation with the Four Pillars. The findings added to drawing the clear and full picture of experience, advancement and sharing the knowledge within the Four Pillars. Identification of Partners under this perspective will facilitate the better composition of cities in the four Working Groups corresponding to the Four Pillars and create efficient buddying system for exchange of experience in re-use and Four Pillars areas (Objective 3, action 3.3 of the Work Plan). It will also support the Working Groups in formulating Policy Frameworks. Additionally, the conclusions from both workshops will aid to specify and attribute particular activities to ULSGs. 
Working Group 3 on “Realising the Potential of Abandoned Military Sites through analysis of Learning Needs, Experience and Practice of Project Partners” - as general tool recommended by URBACT – focused on determining learning needs, experience and practice of the Partners and therefore it will help to distinguish the main donators and consumers of the knowledge among the Partners. The results of this workshop can assist the realization of the activities mentioned above. A scoring system for each category was applied and the results of each workshop are presented in the form of tables. The scores were given after common peer review debate. All tables (or analyses) are open in their form and composed of text and figures. This open formula therefore allows each Partner - at every stage of the Project - to use it as a reference point as the Project develops. A similar analysis can be also done at the final stage of the Project and compared with the initial version. 
Working Group 1. 
Realising the Potential of Abandoned Military Sites through analysis of characteristic features of partners’ military areas as elements of successful planning. Every property owner of a military site, whether it is abandoned or still in use, is responsible for cultivating the cultural heritage, which exists on the site. Unfortunately quite often, the government contributes to deterioration and destruction of this cultural heritage by introducing tougher legislation, regulations and policies that are difficult and expensive for property owners to comply with. The government’s role is to really help property owners to cultivate the cultural heritage through the use of strategic public investment, friendly regulations and incentives. The same approach should be adapted to actions leading to re-use of abandoned military sites. MARKET. Most historic preservation strategies connected to socio-economic re-use of abandoned military heritage work only when there is market demand. Without potential investors ready to buy historically significant buildings, new services, activities, inventive policies, regulations and creative financial mechanisms will be useless. By way of example, revolving funds strategy will be ineffective because the funds cannot resell the historic military properties. LOCATION. Historic military areas or even districts begin with a significant location advantage. The very presence of historically significant structures creates that advantage. Destroy them and the location loses its attractiveness. The military sites were usually located outside cities. But fast urbanisation in 20th century included such sites within the administrative borders of cities, sometimes even in close vicinity of centres, creating empty holes in urban fabric and structure. Designation of such sites by zoning ordinances to be marked within the historic district is in the interest of most property owners. Proximity also plays a role in determining the success or failure of a re-use of military sites strategy. Additionally, other development plans and methods for adjacent premises, if they are opposite to historic military structures or their functions, can make significant harm and damage to planned new re-use, or can even make the whole process impossible. DESIGN. The character of each historic military area is perhaps its most important design feature. In order to attract tourists, the owners of historic military structures and buildings as well as of natural beauty in the surrounding landscape should take care of architectural details, of historical and stylistic importance, in short, of historical urban “climate” of the area. The planning regulations and inventive policy can be highly supportive here. Yet the important factor is to have and adopt different regulatory strategies for different districts where the military sites are located. If design factor is taken seriously into account, it will result in the increase in tourist activity and thus in boosting local job market. Also, private investments in the preservation, renewal and all necessary adaptation works of different military areas will be intensified. FINANCING. Re-use of military sites, historic preservation, renewal and adaptation of military buildings often require more financial resources than banks are willing to lend. The additional funds can come from the sale of development rights, real estate tax credits, income tax deductions or structural funds. The important fact should be explored: the interrelation between numerous funding sources, good financial engineering, relations between revolving funds and tax incentives. ENTERPRENEURSHIP. Somebody will always be needed to spark a historic military area’s re-use, to adapt to new function, to preserve and take renewal efforts. Thus, if we are to preserve the cultural heritage, the government has to create conditions that will allow the broadest spectrum of these actions to flourish. This is necessary to recreate regulatory and financial climate to attract the entrepreneurial talent needed to take care of, re-use and restore abandoned historic military structures. TIME Re-use, renewal, adaptation to new functions and preservation techniques of abandoned military sites need to work in good and bad times. The internal and external conditions can change but methods must be easy to adopt. Societies that cherish their heritage never separate it from everyday life. Cultivating the cultural patrimony means retaining those structures that are genuinely significant, keeping them in a good condition and continually making necessary changes to ensure that they remain a vital part of the environment. The strategies, methods and actions must be sustainable and environment friendly. The analysis of elements of successful planning can be adapted to the process of socioeconomic re-use of abandoned military areas to be part of historic preservation as a planning strategy, especially when formulating Local Action Plans. As it was mentioned before, for any urban development action, whether it is a construction of a new housing estate, commercial centre, sport and recreation facility, regeneration of deteriorated areas or brown fields, there has to be wide market demand. Whether we talk about new construction or rehabilitation, renewal or re-use, the same condition applies. If the demand is missing, every project is bound to face difficulties. Banks will not lend money, sponsors will not support and the project, still beautiful and ambitious, will wait on the paper for better times or be soon forgotten. In such situation there are three possible solutions: forget the project and develop another one which will stick to real market demand, adjust the project and prepare more scenarios anticipating different market demands, as they can also change in time, provoke the market demand and finally realize the project. Such solution, more difficult if possible at all, can take years or decades. During such long period of time the project with its ideas can easily become out of date. That means there will be still no market demand. In this case, the project will not be sustainable. The most difficult task of today’s development strategies and policy frameworks is to obtain their sustainability. Securing the strategies to last for decades, will protect environment and will anticipate the real market demand today and in the future. In addition, such strategies, to be sustainable, must anticipate any changes in climate, transport, consumption, production, demography, health, migration and environment. The “elements of success” were described by Project Partners and scored together by Project Partners and Lead Expert in peer review debate. The result is the average score for each Project Partner and each element. The scoring scale: Excellent – 5, Good – 4, Average – 3, Bad – 2, Not acceptable – 1, Not exist – 0. 
Working Group 2. Realising the Potential of Abandoned Military Sites through analysis of possible re-use of partners’ military areas and their interrelation to main 4 pillars as elements of Local Action Plans. 
The analysis helps to get the answer to the main question of REPAIR: How the partner cities will advance the ‘State of the Art’ using the main pillars of the REPAIR project? As mentioned already in State of the Art, Sustainable Development stands for meeting the needs of present generations without jeopardizing the ability of futures generations to meet their own needs. The planned activities of the REPAIR Network will focus on international exchange of experiences by organising seminars and workshops. Each city will formulate the Main Local Action Plan for the chosen location and 4 mini Local Action Plans concentrated on four main pillars: PRESERVATION. How to develop alternative site uses and techniques, which best secure the long term preservation of the military heritage? ENERGY & WASTE. How to achieve the sustainable re-use of the built heritage and heritage sites, through maximising energy efficiency, the better management of waste production, energy consumption and greater use of renewable energies? TRANSPORT. How to maximise access to military sites by sustainable modes of transport, which minimise car use and decouple transport growth from local GDP growth? JOBS. How the socio-economic re-use of the sites can maximise local jobs for local people and therefore sustainable communities and greater social cohesion? The result of the Workshop gives Urbact Local Support Groups an excellent platform to study further on during the Implementation Phase. But at this stage let’s concentrate on the main analysis that will lead REPAIR Thematic Network directly to the proposed Work Plan. The scoring table (sample table below) used in the workshop enables the assessment the level of interrelation of these functions in the context of Four Pillars. By way of example, reusing a former military site as a tourist attraction may possibly contribute to negative phenomena like increased car traffic, CO2 production, air pollution, etc. This however makes authorities introduce sustainable transport, which is advised (connection to Pillar 3 Transport). It also triggers creation of jobs in the sector of administration, hotels, restaurants, commerce, etc. (connection to Pillar 4 Jobs). In short, every new reuse function (or expectation) has in larger or smaller extent the link to the Four Pillars and has to be considered in such context. PRESERVATION.

The diagram below shows that reuse functions Partners wish to adopt for the military sites, from the most to least frequently indicated. Education. Recreation. Tourism. Sport. Offices and Commercial. Housing. Social Functions. Public Realm. Science Parks. Marketing on Tourism. Research Centre. Artisan. Arts. 
Working Group 3. Realising the Potential of Abandoned Military Sites through analysis of Learning Needs, Experience and Practice of Project Partners. 
REPAIR Lead Expert applied the simple technique of assessment of learning needs, experience and practice provided by Urbact Secretariat three times during the Development Phase. For the first time, it was used during the intake visits of Lead Expert to Partner Cities. The assessments were done together by city representatives and Lead Expert. For the second time, it was exercised two weeks after, via the Internet. Partners were asked again to make assessment with a fresh eye as project developed. And finally, for the third time, the technique was exploited during the workshop moderated by Lead Expert in Kaunas in September 2008 where all the Partners made the assessment during open discussion. By this triple approach all the Partners realized that giving the answers to relatively simple questions was not so straightforward. Due to development of the core issues of the REPAIR Thematic Network, Partners realized that their fist answers did not exactly reflect the real and true local situation. Additionally, Lead Expert had the opportunity to meet three times all the Partners together in one place at a time, and discuss with them the project details: Rostock in June ‘08 (first 5 partners), Berlin in July ‘08 and already mentioned Kaunas in September 2008.  
SUMMARY. 
The effort to enrich cultural military heritage must reflect the entire range of community values and interests. This cannot happen as long as historic preservation of military areas is treated as a special privileged government activity. The cultivation of cultural patrimony, including military heritage, should compete on an equal footing with all the other functions of government. Communities must stop punishing the future potential buyers or investors of historically significant military buildings with increased tax assessments every time they invest in reuse and restoration. Designated landmarks and structures in historic military districts should pay real estate taxes only on the assessed value of the land. The entire nation should stop treating historic preservation of military sites and re-use of historic military buildings as a special activity unrelated to other government functions. Preservation requirements should not be separated from other land use regulations. Historic military areas or even districts should be parts of the cities zoning ordinances. All other historic structures, districts, landmarks should be required only to comply with printed regulations, with no further review. The combination of changes in real estate taxation and land use regulation will place historic preservation and re-use of historic military structures on an equal footing with other public objectives and should be a part of general planning. The new real estate tax policies should remove the disincentive to investing in such historic structures. All these should create conditions in which cultivation of cultural military heritage will become an easy and ongoing public responsibility. In the Schematic below the process developed shows the flow of work from the ground up. The development phase shows Working Group 1 – Elements of Successful Sustainable Development Strategy followed by Working Group 2 – Re-Use Functions in Connection with Four Pillars followed by Working Group 3 – Learning Needs, Experience, Practice. In the implementation phase these Working Groups will be influenced by the input received from the Four Pillars – Preservation, Energy and Waste, Transport and Locol Jobs and the flow of knowledge will move from the point where we refer to an Abandoned Military Site on the one hand to a Re-Used Military Site on the other side. The concept will be underpinned by real experience gained from four Local Action Plans focused on the premises of the Four Pillars with the potential for 2 Pilot Regeneration Projects to become mainstreamed.

1. AGRI-URBAN – STATE OF THE ART 
AGRI-URBAN is about rethinking agri-food production in small and medium-sized cities that have a relative specialization in agri-food production. Agri-food production is a mature industry that still continues to play an important role in terms of GDP, employment and environmental sustainability. That is why new growth potentials have to be activated by means of innovation, new business models and strategies. The objective for this project is to create an Integrated Action Plan for finding a regional food system for each participant city. What do European consumers want on their plate today? A growing movement globally recognizes that the current complexity of food systems based on economies of scale is causing economical, societal and environmental challenges to cities and rural areas. Simultaneously, consumer awareness on food quality, security and healthiness is demanding for alternative food systems. The good news is that not only do many farmers want to provide high quality products that are known to be healthy and safe, it is also better business for them. A US Department of Agriculture study in 2010 comparing revenue from the sale of apples, blueberries, milk, beef and salad, found that in local supply chains almost all the gain is retained in the local economy, with producers receiving a 50% to 649% higher income in comparison to the traditional chains (Friends of the Earth Europe, 2015). Thus closer links between rural areas and nearby cities are not only societally and environmentally beneficial, but also ensure economic development regionally. The problem is that there is an undeniable gap between the general enthusiasm to increase the market share of local products in the cities, and what is actually being accomplished. According to a European Parliament report (2014), the main economic challenges for small farms are access to farming resources (such as land and capital) and access to markets, particularly in terms of bargaining power in the food chain. A food system is a complex web of interconnected entities that take food from its source to our plates. Heavy and complex supply chains give the competitive advantage for large wholesalers instead of smaller, local farms with small quantities of products. Many small farms also lack the entrepreneurial skills to improve their business models, or to identify new business opportunities. Having said that, it should be pointed out that finding new business opportunities in a traditional food system can be difficult with the resource limitations of small producers (European Parliament, 2014). The concept of a local food system suggests that a significant portion of the food eaten by the urban areas should be locally produced. According to a recent study, the three necessary conditions for creating a successful local food system are (Beil & al., s.d.): 1. Cooperation between farmers: Often the challenges of the local food model outweigh the benefits when farms work independently. By developing strong partnerships, local producers can engage in ""cooperation,"" or the sharing of resources from equipment to ideas while operating as competing individuals. 2. Alliances between farms and food businesses: The highly consolidated industrial food markets make it difficult for small-scale producers to enter. Alternative marketing strategies will entail developing partnerships between traditional retailers and local producers through alternative channels, policy incentives and word-of-mouth. 3. Capitalization on local competitive advantage: There are many attributes available in local urban products that industrial food products lack, including freshness, seasonality, variety, and healthiness. Farmers must promote theirs as ""value-added"" products with a story to tell, highlighting the contrasts between their products and those of their industrial competitors. When implemented successfully, a local food system can have a positive impact on three critical levels: environmental sustainability, economic viability and social equity. The AGRI-URBAN network will tackle the challenge of local food systems in small and medium sized cities, developing an alternative way of understanding the link between urban and rural areas with regards to production, supply and consumption of local food. AGRI-URBAN must be able to generate a better understanding of all tested tools and initiatives, inside and outside the partnership, which open new perspectives and opportunities for food production in and nearby our cities. Successful local food system requires creating a “push-and-pull” effect in each city of the network (Figure 1). For the agriculture industry it is important to develop their business into a form that is easy to push to the market: creating new businesses and business models is important, but at least as important it is to find ways to ensure the innovation and growth in existing farms. In addition to optimizing the skills and equipment needed for the actual farming, the post-harvest knowledge should be increased with respect to new business models and improved value chains. These tools, further discussed below, are crucial in order to ensure the business competitiveness of a farm and link it closely with the local city. On the other hand, there are several ways that the city can pull local food onto urban plates, hence bringing success to local agriculture, economy, sustainability and health. For example, public procurement and land access issues have been proven as efficient ways to allow agriculture industry to grow. Furthermore, advocacy for local food production in events, campaigns and actions further ensures that the AGRI-URBAN value chain is their concern as well. The framework created for the purpose consists of four main themes that together create this “push-and-pull” effect. For each theme, the network has also identified a pool of methods that will be the basis for the local action plans (Figure 2). Main themes: Short circuits, smart land use & urban – rural linkages, business development of SMEs and public procurement are the main themes of the AGRI-URBAN project. Each theme is an essential part of creating a successful local food system. It is essential to understand that all themes are strongly interlinked and focusing on any of them will automatically enforce the other themes as well. For example, all activities made in effort to shorten circuits are likely to result in smarter land use, development of SMEs and public food procurement. Subthemes: During Phase 1 of AGRI-URBAN, the network members chose a pool of sub-themes to be addressed. Each subtheme is placed under a theme that it is directly related to, even though many of them are, in fact, indirectly related to other themes, too. These sub-themes have been chosen for framework based on their relevance for the network, past experiences of the participating cities and their expected impact on the local action plan. Each city will choose a collection of sub-themes from this pool to their local action plan, while making sure that the chosen combination covers all main themes equally. Farming and the food industry sustain a significant proportion of employment and income in many small and medium-sized towns, from Western to Eastern Europe. However, this complex of activities from both the primary and secondary sectors is categorized as mature industry. Indeed, in recent decades, a number of trends in Agribusiness have reduced the capacity of those activities to sustain employment in towns. Unemployment rates are generally significantly higher in rural than in urban regions. Urban rural differences are relatively larger than those in economic activity and employment, and are particularly pronounced in countries characterised by high unemployment rates, such as those participating in AGRI-URBAN. Also, female and youth unemployment rates tend to be relatively high in rural regions, as well as the long term (more than 1 year) unemployment. In rural areas it is estimated that “hidden unemployment” (involving underemployed farmers and farm workers) is higher than in urban areas. There are many causes and circumstances that led up to this situation, among others, the following: *?Social and cultural disconnection with the reality of agri-food production from urban societies, diffusing the prior relationship town-country and replacing it with another where new social and cultural borders appear; *?Overall decrease of the primary sector in terms of employment due to different reasons: profitability, mechanization, globalization and international division of labour, etc.; *?Prevalence of agro industrial production systems that represent significant environmental and social imbalances compared to the prior existing production systems, e.g. overconsumption of water and agrochemicals, loss of biodiversity, pollution, low and seasonal labour demand, ageing and loss of farmer´s autonomy, rising of single-crop farming; *?Loss of farmland in urban peripheries and urban land, in favour of other residential or industrial land uses, distorting dramatically land prices; *?Agriculture as health and wellness provider has lost the leading role it has traditionally played in relation to quality of people's life. Instead, a globalised, concentrated food model has been expanded, resulting in overconsumption of processed foods high in protein… putting to an end traditional domestic food culture, *?All in all, somewhat polarization has emerged in different frameworks (land development and town planning, SMEs development…) between farming and food production on the one hand and other activities more clearly linked to technology, added value and white collar professional profiles. The AGRI-URBAN project will address the unemployment problem by contributing to a fast transition of rural economies. The economic structure of rural regions is in transformation: the share of the primary sector in GVA declines continuously, while the share of the tertiary sector grows. This is a general trend in all regions, but it is more pronounced in rural regions. The growth in tourism illustrates the growth of the tertiary sector. It is increasing in all regions (especially in Southern European countries) and is found as a main driver for growth and employment. Rural areas across the EU have undergone profound changes in the last few decades. One of the most pervasive changes is the sectoral shift and the decline of the relative importance of agriculture in the rural economies of Europe, driven largely by productivity increases across the sector. In the EU27, while 96% of rural land use is agricultural (including forestry) only approximately 13% of employment is in agriculture, producing only 6% of gross value added in rural regions. Although the employment from the primary sector has declined from 18% in 2000 to 12% in 2006, the key activities (agriculture, forestry and fishing) remain important rural activities. In rural regions across the EU27 the share of primary sector employment is more than twice the share of primary sector gross value added. It was observed that there is a tendency for fewer but larger farms (in ha and €) and that the average age of farmers is increasing. Critically, primary sector activities also act as a platform for many kinds of diversification activities. The tertiary sector has become a more important job creator in rural regions. In both employment and GVA the tertiary sector increases. It was found that the expansion of the secondary and tertiary sectors is one of the main drivers of economic growth in rural regions. New activities have grown up, including tourism, small scale, niche manufacturing and food production and business services. Thus, those urban economies in transition to more sustainable models are finding opportunities in re-thinking the agri-food production, which is especially relevant in the so-called agro-cities of the European area. More widely, a number of tested initiatives which are dealing with job creation in agribusiness in urban and suburban contexts are already showing their potential, e.g. community vegetable gardens, local markets, municipal land banks, farming spaces for young entrepreneurs, e-commerce, technology parks in the food sector, rising of short distribution channels, green markets, agro-ecological suburban belts. At this point, we understand that employment and job creation, along with competitiveness, is the main focus of AGRI-URBAN, in terms of international crosslearning and action planning at local level. Employment is one of the ten operational thematic objectives of the EUROPE 2020 Strategy of the European Union, and central to a project that to a large extent will be developed in regions with very high rates of unemployment and job instability associated to the current economic crisis. It is also a cross-cutting objective for its direct and indirect impact on the remaining thematic objectives. Most of the initiatives herein mentioned are proving to be useful in terms of job creation, under various forms, especially by encouraging self-employment and creation of small and medium-sized family and social enterprises. Furthermore, these small initiatives, albeit embedded into proximity networks, host a potential for scaling up. The next sections will introduce each of the four AGRI-URBAN themes, explaining their connection and impact in relation to raising jobs in the food supply chain. Within each theme, we will also discuss in detail the subtheme chosen to address the main themes, along with a case example. Together the four sections will give a good overview on the key elements needed to create a successful local food system, along with prime examples of methodologies that cities in the AGRI-URBAN network will be using in their local action plans.

1.1 ENSURING SHORTS CIRCUITS 
The globalized nature of food production creates both a physical and a psychological distance between the consumer and the farmer. Not so long ago the food on people’s plates used to be local by default. The shift to long circuits presents consumers with an increasing variety of foods to choose from at supermarkets. This industrial ""long-distance"" food model resulted in what has been identified as the ""Wal-Mart Effect"": international food conglomerates, aided by favourable national and international trade policies, wrested market shares from local growers and purveyors through intense financial investment. The result can be observed as the decrease of money, jobs and food out of local economies (Beil & al., s.d.). In order to fight these erosive effects, agriculture industry needs to ensure their business operates with shorter circuits. Short circuits of production and consumption can increase profit margins, generate greater autonomy for farmers and foster customer loyalty by linking products to a local area shared by producers and consumers. The shortest circuit is direct sale by producers (such as farm sales, farmers’ markets, fairs, baskets, community sales point). Also sales with one intermediary (such as Internet, retail sales, shops) are proven to increase the final price received by those involved and to bring better products to the consumer. Supporting small retailers’ competition with large supermarkets is not only important in their own right because they play a part in supporting local economy, as they are able to buy smaller quantities of produce from local farmers (Good planning for good food, 2011). In order to shorten the circuits, small farms are looking into alternative outlets and sales channels, such as farmers’ markets, on-farm shops, food hubs and online shops.  
1.1.1 URBAN MARKETS 
The urban market has always been and continues to be one of the most popular ways to shorten the food system circuits. They are by far the most popular and visible component of local food systems, and the mingling of farmers and shoppers there represents one of the few daily connections between urban and rural people in our era. Any city can encourage the growth of markets by providing spaces suitable for holding markets with flexibility and low-cost. For farmers, markets are entry points for new agri-food entrepreneurs because they are relatively inexpensive to start and operate. Markets are fast becoming more popular again after almost disappearing from the urban landscape, as the security and sustainability of food has become a mainstream demand for the customers. Markets bring the consumption of fresh and unprocessed food onto citizens’ plates, consumers and farmers closer to one another and engage public institutions in the promotion of local agriculture whilst contributing to sustainable development. Because of their long history and low entry barrier, markets are an important source of economic, social and cultural benefits for not only farmers, but consumers. 
1.1.2 ONLINE SHOPS 
Due to technological advancement, online shops are rapidly becoming a more popular form of agriculture outlets. With the rise of ICT, an increasing number of farms are starting to set up a simple form on their website, where an order can be placed without any intermediates. Furthermore, Facebook groups within cities are known to have been created to facilitate direct interaction between consumers and local farmers. These Facebook groups enable direct sales with high profit margins for the farmer, quality products at a low price for the consumer and completely transparent supply chains. Some regions have also established a web-based online agriculture shopping experience. Collecting the food offering of the local producers into one online platform makes the shopping easier and more convenient for the consumer, while minimizing the technical maintenance work for the farmers (Beil & al., s.d.). These online shops can also be considered to be virtual food hubs. 
1.1.3 ON-FARM SHOPS 
Direct marketing outlets have expanded dramatically due to increasing consumer demand for local fresh and valuedadded food products. On-farm shops, where producers can sell their fresh produce, valueadded food items, and other arts and crafts are popular direct marketing avenues for farms that want to diversify their sales outlets. A recent survey conducted in the US shows the high interest in farm shops: 36% of respondents have considered selling their products through farm shops, 79% would attend extension workshops on farm shop establishment and operation and 73% would consider joining a food hub or state-wide farm shops system (College of Agricultural Sciences Penn State, 2014). On-farm shops also contribute significantly to the food tourism sector: the consumers will take the experience of purchasing food into a new level, when they get to see the environment and background of their food, very much in accordance to the current food trends that emphasize the importance of healthy and secure food. 
1.1.4 FOOD HUBS 
Food hubs are part of a growing local food system that strengthens rural economies by lowering entry barriers and improving infrastructure to expand regional food markets. In order locally produced goods to become a competitive alternative for wholesalers with long circuits, the farmers need to find ways to tackle the economies of scale. The fact is that sourcing food locally can be a major logistical problem for food service operators, which is the main reason why it is often not done even if the operator would favour local production. Sourcing from dozens of local farmers and suppliers is not a cost-effective use of management time and talent, which is why economies of scale support derived from working with major food service wholesalers. The establishment of new business entities known as food hubs aligns the demand for locally grown foods with the ease of one-stop shopping. Food hubs are intermediaries between farmers and large scale wholesalers, operating at the centre of a network of individual, small-scale farmers and producers. Recognition of the role of food hubs is occurring at many levels, from a growth in brick and mortar facilities to “virtual food hubs”. Food hubs provide logistic support, marketing, and food safety expertise, as well as increase the availability of seasonal products by maintaining relationships with local farmers. This way, when one farmer’s crop becomes exhausted, another farmer can continue the supply of produce. Food hubs also help to reduce wastage by matching supply with demand: if there is a surplus of a particular food item in one area hubs make the excess product available to dealers in other areas. 
1.2 SMART LAND USE AND ACCESS 
No discussion of sustainable regional food systems is complete without understanding the impact of land use and planning on the economic, environmental and social equity goals at the heart of sustainability efforts. The interest in food production, supply chain and security are becoming evident in cities, where urban agriculture is gaining momentum. Lack of space has been tackled with innovative solutions that allow citizens to not only have agricultural elements in their living environment, but also to practice agriculture and to consume self-grown products themselves. In rural areas, access to land is restricted by the small proportions coming onto the market, high prices and the need for suitably located and serviced areas. Large corporate farms often distort the land rental market, and this has shown to challenge new farmers with risk and investment costs. New ways – such as land partnerships and community farming - are introduced to lower the barrier of entry to become a farmer. It is generally accepted that land use planning is most effective at the local or regional scale. In the context of regional food system, smart land use helps to achieve more sustainable land uses and growth management; community benefits, such as community identity, environmental protection and economic growth; and preparedness for future needs. This section gives an overview on urban land use as well as on rural land access. 
1.2.1 URBAN LAND USE 
Although cities themselves may not be self-sustaining food systems, available urban infrastructure and rising transportation costs suggest cities will increasingly try to secure as much food as possible from within their limits. Worldwide, municipal policymakers are increasingly aware that urban agriculture can contribute to regional food security, especially in developing nations. It also has potential to provide employment, improve the environment, and make productive use of vacant spaces within the city. The UN Development Program estimates 800 million people engage in urban agriculture, the majority in Asian countries. Of these, 200 million raise their food for markets while the rest raise it for personal use. As a response to the “Walmart effect” of the past decades, urban agriculture is making a comeback also in more developed countries. In addition to increased awareness for food security, the reasons for the comeback have been identified to be in response to economic crises, high migration rates and loss of diversity. In addition to the environmental and nutritional benefits of locally grown food, urban agriculture improves perceived quality of life. Reduction of food miles to urban centres also reduces the cost of shipping and significantly decreases the cost of produce. Locally grown produce does not need to be refrigerated for shipping because it can be harvested and consumed in the same day. This has beneficial effects on the economy and the environment. Personal gardens can reduce the family food budget, freeing constrained financial resources for other uses. Surpluses can be given away or traded with friends and neighbors to strengthen social networks, or they can be sold to supplement household income. For example, with the growing interest on food production, allotments, community growing spaces and a range of other under-utilized public and private spaces are increasingly being used to increase the availability of healthy and sustainable food, thereby contributing to biodiversity. It has also been shown to contribute to health benefits (mental and physical), better diets, physical activities, urban biodiversity, and regeneration of underused spaces, community cohesion and potential for economic development. In the future, urban agriculture is expected to increase its popularity and become even more diversified. The future trends are expected to include initiatives such as rooftop gardens, gardens on water and green buildings. 
1.2.2 RURAL LAND ACCESS 
In rural areas, creative and skilled people are needed. It is crucial that entrepreneurs gain access to land so that they can develop diverse enterprises. However, access to land is often one of the top challenges facing new farmers, since very little farmland changes hands. Amongst the EU- 15, the proportion of utilized agricultural area sold each year in most countries is below 2%. Land may of course be transferred between farms by means other than sale, e.g. through renting. In principle, this is more flexible over time, and avoids the need for finding considerable financial resources. However, rental markets are subject to some of the same constraints as land sales markets. The conventional way to rent land is for a landowner to advertise a tenancy opportunity with a ready-made draft agreement. Prospective tenants compete for selection through a tendering process. This procedure is inflexible, requires considerable starting investments and has a high risk. In recent decades, other forms of farmland tenure have appeared, in addition to simple farmland rental from landowner to tenant, and may involve family farms. These forms include e.g. share farming, contract farming and other forms of joint venture. With these new initiatives, new farmers get land with lower-risk and with more support. For example, community-supported agriculture (CSA) is an alternative, locally based economic model of agriculture and food distribution, where growers and consumers share the risks and benefits of food production. In CSA models, members pay at the beginning of the growing season for the anticipated harvest and once harvesting begins, they periodically receive shares of produce and possibly some additional farm products like honey, eggs, dairy, fruit, flowers and meat. Also the land partnership concept has proven to be a beneficial alternative for traditional land contracts. By bringing together entrepreneurs and land owners a win-win situation can be created. The land partnerships approach encourages both parties taking the initiative to shape the nature of the business deal itself, with less fixed details for the contract. This approach is more flexible, stable and sustainable. Encouraging landowners and land entrepreneurs to combine resources to create new land enterprises provides the owner with new ways to diversify their operation, while giving the land entrepreneurs a chance to apply and develop their business skills without the high cost of land purchase. The outcomes might include better use of assets, integration of enterprises, improved risk management, different ways of marketing, or the creation of a new business. There are already successful cases of joint ventures, community farms and land scholarships in Europe.  
1.3 BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT OF SMES 
Most food policies currently focus on food production issues. However, for local approaches to urban agriculture to succeed, farmers will increasingly need to extend their technical and economic knowledge in order to locally address each link in the food chain (Beil & al., s.d.). The majority of the EU’s 12 million farms are family farms. These and other small farms currently provide 70% of the world’s food (Friends of the Earth Europe, 2015). They contribute to the socio-economic and environmental sustainability of rural areas significantly. The process of agricultural restructuring in Europe has made these SMEs aware of their need to become more entrepreneurial. The local economies have a huge impact in the entrepreneurial skillset of the farmers, showing that a high degree of integration of farming activity and products with rural economies is in correlation with entrepreneurial skills. Therefore, the discussion on entrepreneurial skills should always be linked to a discussion of the role of the farmer in different settings and the contemporary European agricultural production. Many farmers and entrepreneurs require help to develop the business skills and access to resources that allow them to successfully launch or expand profitable businesses. Technological progress and structural change in the agriculture sector will offset certain disadvantages of some but not all SMEs in respect of economic efficiency. More knowledge intensive and innovative management will allow some farms to grow, capture economies of scale and increase their competitiveness in the European and world market. This section introduces five important methods that can be used to increase the competitiveness of agriculture SMEs: Entrepreneurship and Incubation, Business skills, Digital transformation, Awareness campaigns and Food tourism. 
1.3.1 ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND INCUBATION 
Young farmers represent the future of our food supplies and they also play key roles in safeguarding the other benefits that a healthy countryside provides. However, Europe’s young farmers are declining in numbers, an issue widely recognized as a big threat to agrifood activities. Supporting the farmer’s entrepreneurial position is crucial to raising the odds for success in his or her new business. A starting farmer usually needs three things: education, land and money. A farming incubator is believed to provide a solution to all three. Farming incubators have become a trend especially in North-America in a very short period of time. The incubators seek to increase the market share of locally produced, ecological and secure food by providing resources for individuals to start small and sustainable agriculture businesses. Fuelled by an increase in funding available for farmer training programs and encouraged by consumer interest in sustainably produced food, incubator farms are popping up across the country. Incubators have been envisioned as a step toward a food system that today exists only on the margins: one made up of smaller farms that use fewer chemicals, in which food travels shorter distances between farm and table and that is accessible to all people. The incubators allow low-risk space for innovation and experimentation needed in order to grow the business. 
1.3.2 BUSINESS SKILLS 
When discussing business skills of farmers, three distinctive dimensions can be identified: managerial practices, entrepreneurial attitudes and new skills. Gaining understanding on all of these dimensions has been identified as a crucial requirement for SME agri-businesses. The problem is not only with delivering business tasks within agri-companies. Recognizing the business opportunities, alternative business models and strategic elements only requires an understanding on what needs to be done and why for the company to grow. Few farmers have the time or experience to analyse the strengths and weaknesses of their business. Trainings and toolkits are an essential way for educating the farmers on new possibilities. The most effective method has, however, proven to be networks amongst agri-companies, but also bringing business networks in collaboration with agricompanies. Applying the skills and know-how of the business experts allows farmers to take their company to the next level either via adapted knowledge or outsourcing the business tasks. The trend for diversifying, for example, is a major opportunity to SMEs but also a great business challenge. Diversification has been identified as one of the most successful strategies for small farms today to grow their business. Since specialized food is increasingly achieving mainstream status, there have been significant changes in supply chain dynamics. Producers with business skills have changed their strategy and, for example, formed business alliances and partnerships to benefit from economies of scale and to better access distribution channels, as well as to help ensure more consistent supplies. However, forming innovative business alliances is not in the skillset of many farmers, thus leaving them excluded from these opportunities. 
1.3.3 DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION 
Agriculture has been described as the most inefficient industry, partially due to its lack of ICT adaptation. SME farms are slow in adopting IT solutions for a number of reasons, such as the large investments required, but also for example because they are not familiar with available technologies or they have a negative perception of the cost-benefit ratio. However, adapting modern technology through the value chain of agriculture would bring significant benefits to production, supply chains as well as in reaching out to the consumer. Digital transformation can improve the efficiency of agri-food production along with the quality and safety of the products. With new technology farming is reaching new levels of efficiency. One of the most significant new concepts around this theme is known as precision farming. The purpose of precision farming is optimizing returns on inputs while preserving resources. Precision farming refers to a management concept focusing on real time observation, measurement and responses of crops, fields and animals. It includes creating a map containing information about the physical dispersion of the test results or yield, based on GPS located samples and a geographic information system (GIS). Other applications make use of remote sensing: for example, satellites or airplanes take pictures of fields, and sensors monitor constantly the changes of the soil. One major problem is the different stages and directions of development within the knowledge-based supply chain. Testimonies from Portuguese and Spanish companies consulted by the eFoodChain initiative show that the use of electronic data exchange by producers is almost inexistent, whereas it is almost systematically used by retailers. But even on the retail side the use of electronic data exchange is limited to financial operations (European Parliament, 2014). This is why companies should aim to improve data management and exchange throughout the product supply chain with ICT, providing more accurate and timely information flow to all stakeholders. In addition to improving the existing business models, ICT can be a powerful driver of transparency across existing producer consumer networks. Consumers are requesting continuously more specific and detailed information on the food product, its origin, the organization of production processes with their environmental impacts and issues of social concerns. In this, ICT can be an essential tool, as in new innovations already used to communicate the food origin in ways that have never been possible before. 
1.3.4 AWARENESS CAMPAIGN 
The demand for secure and sustainable food is a growing trend globally. According to the Natural Marketing Institute, 71% of French and 47% of Spanish and British consumers claim that it is important to buy local products (European Commission, 2014). In addition to the economic benefits of a heightened awareness, the positive outcomes include healthier diets and better culinary experiences. In successful cases, increased awareness can also lead to external recognition for traditional and quality gastronomic products, providing a mechanism for both attracting and retaining visitors in the area (European Commission, 2013; European Union, 2011). Building awareness is something that needs to happen in collaboration at all levels of AGRI-URBAN networks. For example, in Hungary the commitment of supporting local food producers has officially been made not only by cities, but also journalists, restaurants and chefs. All of these have the capability to raise awareness for local food systems in their business. 
1.3.5 FOOD TOURISM 
When awareness campaigns are taken to a next level, a culture of food tourism can be found. Food tourism is an experiential trip to a gastronomic region, including visits to primary and secondary producers of food, festivals, fairs, events, farmers’ markets, cooking shows and demonstrations. Food experiences can stimulate local development, because food tourism can extend the tourist season and diversify rural economies. Food experiences are labour intensive and create jobs while producing backward linkages that stimulate agriculture, and they generally do not require major new investment. Food can contribute to regional attractiveness, sustain the local environment and cultural heritage and strengthen local identities and sense of community. Additionally, evidence suggests that the concept of farm-based tourism is growing and that diversifying a farm into tourism is a viable strategy for surviving the economic pressure in a sustainable manner. Farmers with high-levels of education have been observed as being more likely to test their ground in farm-based tourism.  
1.4 LOCAL PUBLIC PROCUREMENT 
Public institutions have much more influence than we realize when it comes to deciding what we eat. Significant amounts of food are served in public facilities every day. The food that goes into these meals can either damage or improve the nation's health, and damage or promote environmentally sustainable food production. Public money can be used either to import the cheapest ingredients from around the world or provide markets for local farmers. When implemented successfully, public procurement has shown to have a significant impact on local SMEs and to shorten the circuits effectively. Within the EU, public procurement spends approximately 16% of GDP. This figure in itself presents a significant opportunity to promote socially and environmentally friendly products and services. Sustainable public procurement does not only bring a region environmental benefits and a tool for shared commitment to common objectives, but also a multiplier effect on the local rural economy. This section will focus on the opportunities and cases related to public plate. CASE: 
1.4.1 PUBLIC PLATE 
Public plate in schools has quickly risen into a hot political topic in the last year. While Italy seems to be leading the way in locally-sourced school food programs (see case study from Rome), also Brazil, Scotland, Japan, the United States, France, Sweden and Canada have all deployed programs which utilize local producers and attempt to increase nutritional value in school food. The opportunity is huge: almost all high-income countries have school lunch programs, and 70 out of the 108 low- and middle-income countries of the world have some sort of school food program. Since governments purchase such large amounts of food, they have the ability to control not only the quality of the food purchased, but the food sources. Indeed, providing school children with nutritious and healthy food has been addressed in the governmental policies around the world in recent years with increasing efforts. The second most common form of local public plate is applying the policies for hospital food. For example, in Portland, USA, sustainable food procurement policies that support local urban agriculture have been used to build relationships between local fresh food producers and hospitals. Furthermore, armed forces, central and local government, government agencies, prisons and courts are all potential targets for the use of public plate. The finding on the experiments taking place with public plates help the public institutions to understand costs-benefit relationships between the additional expenses caused by the system and the environmental, societal and economic benefits of it, as well as to discover the most effective ways for public plate in different circumstances.

"RESILIENT EUROPE.
European cities joining forces to improve city resilience.
The cities in the URBACT Resilient Europe network will work together to learn and share experiences with the aim to foster resilience and sustainability. Becoming more resilient means that a city strives to enhance its ability to bounce back and grow even stronger and better in the face of the chronic stresses and acute shocks. As such, city resilience is a continuous challenge for individuals, communities, institutions, businesses and infrastructure systems to address current trends and future transitions. We will look at the challenges of achieving resilience in and of our cities in a comprehensive and holistic way. 

The approach of Resilient Europe is to apply the lessons from the innovative governance approach of Transition Management. Transition Management is a process-oriented and participatory steering approach that enables social learning through iterations between collective vision development and experimenting. Transition Management will be applied to structure the dialogues and co-creation process in every city and across the cities for specifying “what city resilience means” for each city, to enable a translation and identification of resilience aspirations of stakeholders in a participatory vision development way and to formulate a Integrated Action Plan to pave the ground for achieving city resilience.

Concept Note.
This document is a concept note on urban resilience that aims to provide an overview of its meaning and its dimensions as well as a perspective on how to experiment for understanding and achieving place-explicit action for urban resilience. As such it is developed to be employed as an input to discussions on strategic and operational action for urban resilience, and to inform multiple stakeholders on the caveats of urban resilience (thinking). It is not a comprehensive literature review on urban resilience, and, it is not an in depth problematization on the concept. This is not an academic paper on urban resilience even though it builds from and is inspired by academic writings on resilience. Above all, this concept note aims to introduce urban resilience to cities that are in the forefront of action for the future and requested a new frame of reference – ‘urban resilience’ – to progress both their planning practice as well as their policy learning. After a co-creation phase of five months with 11 different cities across Europe that participate in the Resilient Europe project, urban resilience is adopted as a new frame of reference to promote holistic thinking, meta-governance orientation across different departments of the cities. 
Urban resilience - What is it? 
Urban resilience is the capacity of urban systems, communities, individuals, organisations and businesses to recover maintain their function and thrive in the aftermath of a shock or a stress, regardless its impact, frequency or magnitude. Urban resilience is not a new concept, it has been debated and discussed over the past decades across scientific disciplines including urban planning. With its origins in ecology (Folke 2002; Gunderson and Holling 2002) the concept has diffused across types of systems also including the city. Following the diffusion of the concept and its uptake over the past years is not an easy task, with the amount of cross-citations to the original founding thinkers of resilince like Carl Folke counting to 80,063 (google scholar profile, visited 12.03.2015). There are however overarching characteristics to what we understand and conceptualise as ‘system’s resilience’ that are recognized across the multiple fields and applications: (a) the attribution of capacity to a system to absorb, recover, restore and thrive in the aftermath of a impactful event and (b) the reference to a system-wide property rather than to its parts and (c) the implication of social, ecological, technological, economic and institutional dimensions to building resilience at system level. Resilience has been defined as the amount of disturbance a (urban) system can absorb and still remain within the same state or domain of attraction, and the degree to which the system can build and increase its capacity for learning and adaptation (Folke et al 2004). When a human or ecological system loses its resilience, it becomes increasingly vulnerable to disturbances that previously could be absorbed. Although resilience has been explored in many complex social-ecological systems (Folke et al 2004) it has only recently been applied in the context of cities (Ernstson et al 2010). “Resilience thinking has developed effective heuristics concerning change, i.e., adaptation, transformation, panarchy, but less focus has been given to the notion of stability, or theorizing the stable characteristics of a resilient system.” (Rotarangi and Stephenson, 2014) Resilience is the “capacity of a community or society to adapt when exposed to a hazard. (…) A resilient society can withstand shocks and rebuild itself when necessary. Resilience in social systems has the added human capacity to anticipate and plan for the future” (Presad et al 2009, p.32) (also supported by Mumby et al 2014). In the similar approach, is the definition of resilience as “the ability of systems and components thereof, to react in such a way to external or internal disturbances that – after a period of recovery – the essential characteristics (abiotic and biotic characteristics, as well as functional relationships) are retained.” (Knaapen et al 1999) (also supported by Remmelzwaal and Vroon, 2000; van Bohemen 2012; van Bueren et al 2012). It is only recent, that resilience has been enriched with cultural understandings. Cultural resilience “has emerged to refer to this continuity of a co-constituted set of long-term relationships between the cultural identity of a people and the set of social- ecological relationships within which this identity was founded.” (Rotarangi and Stephenson, 2014). In Resilient Europe, we start with the definition of urban resilience as follows: ‘urban resilience is the capacity of urban systems, communities, individuals, organisations and businesses to recover maintain their function and thrive in the aftermath of a shock or a stress, regardless its impact, frequency or magnitude’. 
Resilience of cities.
 Cities are homes to the future. With more than 60% of world population living in cities, the focus is on how to make them more sustainable in terms of consumption, living conditions and socio-environmental footprint. Europe is in general in a good position for developing the new tools needed for realising a positive transition to resilient and sustainable urban areas. Compared to most other continents, the living standards are good, the decision- making processes are fairly open, and the level of knowledge is high. European demographics, though, i.e. ageing populations, represent a challenge to innovative transitions. However, these may be turned into opportunities, since an ageing population due to gender differences in life expectancy results in increased participation of women in decision-making. This growing segment of the population may likely be more willing to invest in green innovations that increase quality of life in return. However, with no ‘100 new million-big cities in 20 years’ projects, which is the major focus for investment and driver of urban development in Asia, the Middle East and South America, Europe has to focus on projects of retrofitting, regeneration and redevelopment of existing cities. Thus, Europe needs new innovative income/jobs gene rating models and governance approaches. We position that urban resilience as a new concept and guidance principle can elucidate ways to restore, create and advance Europe’s cities for the future we want. As thus, new ways of thinking of resilience of cities are required also including the on-going emerging and facilitated/ planned processes that contribute to this aspiration. The (positive) transition to the urban resilience represents the focus of studies and analyses and cities to work towards resilience in cities that includes mainly four urban domains: 1) Urban landscape, urban ecosystems also referring to supply and enjoyment of ecosystem services, 2) Infrastructures including structures and services, 3) People, the communities and their capacities to recover, thrive and innovate and 4) Institutions and governance including but not limited to adaptive governance, collaborative decision-making and behavioural change. Positive or in the context of Europe, desirable transition is the process through which a city understands vulnerabilities, adapts urban planning accordingly and foster collaboration at multiple scales. This happens so as to fully integrate public and private sectors and citizens in the process of transformation to sustainability. The city strives to reconnect with vital social and ecological systems beyond its jurisdictional boundaries, thus fostering a state of high adaptive and transformative capacity building urban resilience. A negative or undesirable transition is the process through which a city fails to adapt to and anticipate urban crises and undergoes forced transformation at an unacceptable socio-economic and ecological cost, resulting in urban erosion or urban collapse, i.e. cities transformed into an undesirable state as a result of inaction to address the challenges and system pressures and where citizens lack sense of place. Responses to improve urban resilience are not always in tune to the adaptive and reflexive approaches that are required to address the interconnected systems and components thereof that contribute to urban resilience. Such a incremental response is urban optimisation. Optimization refers to the process of improving the existing city structures and responses, “more of the same”. Examples of optimization of an existing system include the heightening of dikes for flood control infrastructure, expanding of road capacity by adding an extra traffic line, installing air-conditioning to cool buildings using fossil fuel generated electricity, etc. This may lead to a high risk of an urban lock-in i.e. where the urban system is unable to transform itself due to sunk costs, investments in existing infrastructures, dominating practices, routines and “thick” institutionalization. To address the transition to urban resilience a framework for understanding ‘what makes up urban resilience’ and a process approach on ‘how to get there from present states’ are required to be linked. The following sections progress into the understanding of urban resilience and ‘what makes up’ urban resilience and conclude with the way to achieve it in the scope of the Resilient Europe project. 
Resilience for cities.
 Urban resilience is a concept that only recently has been actively undertaken by cities around the world. Even though the concept exists in the scientific literature since the 1970s and research on urban ecology has engaged with the concept mainly for introducing thinking on complexity, social-ecological systems and their vulnerabilities (Pickett et al 2008; McPhearson et al 2015; Andersson et al 2015), it is only to a limited degree informed plans and policies at city level. Interpretative and analytical work on the benefits of urban resilience concept as an analytical bridging concept for urban planning provided directions for its adaptation by cities (Wilkinson et al 2010; Wagenaar and Wilkinson 2015). In this concept note we build on this work as already introduced in the preceding sections and extend it by showing what the recognized benefits are when introducing and taking up the concept of urban resilience in strategic level as well as in program level of urban governance. We build from a knowledge co-production discovery journey (Frantzeskaki and Kabisch 2016) that brings together insights from 11 European cities that forerun in adopting the urban resilience concept at strategic and program level. The commonly recognized benefits of (uptaking and adopting the concept of) urban resilience in urban planning and governance include five deployments of the concept of urban resilience at strategic and program levels. At the strategic level of urban governance include that urban resilience is an integrative, solution-searching and orienting and transformative concept. First, urban resilience is an integrative concept that allows connecting objectives and actions across different departments for developing a common understanding and strategic agenda for achieving it. Indicatively, for the city of Antwerp, the concept of urban resilience provides a new frame to integrate social and spatial issues into the climate adaptation policy development process. As a connecting and integrating lens, urban resilience is employed in the city of Antwerp to continue experimenting with co-creative ideas to improve livability and sustainability in the city. The city of Antwerp is established as a city open to experiment on new concepts and ideas together with the community. The city’s progressive platform for urban living, the StadsLab 2050, includes a series of experimental interventions and processes of co-production that citizens and civil society organisations are included in the beginning of the process to think, imagine and design with the local government urban interventions. In the same vein, for the city of Ioannina the concept of urban resilience provides a new frame to connect different urban aspirations and ideas about livability, sustainability, cohesion, development and robustness that also consider chronic stresses and shocks the city is facing. As such, the city adopts the perspective of urban resilience to allow for an integrative mode of planning to bring together social, ecological and infrastructural aspirations that will co-shape city’s future. At present the city faces pressures for regeneration of urban areas, for maintaining urban infrastructure and for dealing with the ecological degradation and depreciation of its greater asset that is the Pamvotida lake. With the city slowly growing and the local government attempting to establish an outward and forward looking approach in seeking lessons, best practices and new approaches, there are lots of persisting challenges that need a different approach. The disrupted communication across departments of the local government, the discontinuous inter-agency collaboration that creates relations of mistrust and confrontation, the creativity loss since creative solutions are not connected to plans and programs when they are formulated but remain latent and an urban development that has only partially appreciated and valorized the lake’s beauty and recreational value. Second, urban resilience is a concept that allows searching for systemic solutions in (view of) vulnerabilities and risks (“turn risks into opportunities”). Indicatively, for the city of Potenza, the concept of urban resilience is a new frame that allows positioning civil protection as an element for urban development and not as the core and only priority for the future of the city. The frame of urban resilience allows and will benefit the city of Potenza to take a multi-dimensional approach to be a city of the future. The city of Potenza is build in a hill with most of the urban dwelling benefiting from a view to the valley and to the sprawling extensions of the city over the past years. With the city of Potennza taking Le Corbusier’s planning paradigm as the only way to earthquake-proof the city, a lock-in in thinking and imagining entrenched planning ways. Thinking about urban resilience is a way to shift mindset and policy priorities to a more forward-looking integrated approach. Third, urban resilience is transformative concept that requires new planning approaches that address resilience qualities such as redundancy and flexibility that are contradictory to the quality of efficiency (that is a basic principle to new public management approach that many cities follow). Indicatively, for the city of Glasgow the concept of urban resilience is employed as a frame to continue the community development works the city has been doing while considering dimensions of ecological and infrastructural integrity. The city of Glasgow has long been working on connecting environmental and social policies and programs and considers the frame of urban resilience to contribute fundamentally to planning and policy integration. As such, urban resilience understanding allows further integrating and modernizing the programs and plans across different levels of involvement: district, city and region. For deepening the impact of the new approaches and new programs for urban resilience across the different levels, the city of Glasgow takes up an experimental approach with a place-explicit focus – the Glasgow Urban Living Lab- as the way to engage with multiple stakeholders beyond consultation and service provision and with the focus on empowerment and co-creation. At the program level of urban governance, urban resilience is used as learning and empowering concept. Fourth, urban resilience is a multi-faceted concept that requires a new understanding of contextual conditions across social, ecological, economic and institutional sub-systems and in turn, allows for policy learning about assets and vulnerabilities. Indicatively, the city of Vejle identified urban resilience as a frame of reference that provides the opportunity to combine new thinking about social, economic, ecological and institutional assets and vulnerabilities with acting for social shocks and stresses with ecological and economical programming in the city. The urban resilience frame enables rethinking current approaches, sheds light to new opportunities for urban planning as well as attracts community members to actively collaborate with the city and create socially fit plans and programs. With this understanding that a new integrative approach is required, the city proposed as an experimental site the West End district that faces newly recognized social challenges such as illegal small-businesses, increased criminal activities although marginal incidents have occurred and increased unease in the areas although not openly shared but concentrated in small community networks. The reason for choosing an experimental approach as a means to design action for urban resilience is that a top-down approach to resolve such an interconnected problem of urban upheaval due to limited knowledge it brings and the requirement for a place-specific and community- supported if not community-led intervention. Fifth, urban resilience is an empowering concept for community engagement and programs that allows deeper understanding of assets and barriers to overcome social vulnerabilities and social problems. Indicatively, for the city of Malmo, the concept of urban resilience provides a new frame to renew and rediscover a new way to community engagement, from consultation to co-creation. The city of Malmo with its established profile as a city of knowledge economy and innovation is facing pressures for new housing that does satisfy the needs of new residents and especially families. The urban resilience frame allows searching of new ways to create sense of place and sense of communities from the bottom up engaging with visions for place and community and establish new collaborative relations between the city and its citizens. For the city of Bristol, the concept of urban resilience provides a frame to create synergies across different programs for climate adaptation, community empowerment and urban regeneration. It is a synthesis frame that adds to the progressive efforts of the city to become more socially innovative, attractive and inclusive to its diverse communities. The biggest assets for the city of Bristol include a well educated and self-organised innovative population that is shown by the variety of community initiatives on urban gardening, urban living labs, energy initiatives, co-labs and fab-labs in the city as well as the open attitude of the city to different visions and ways of engaging citizens, communities and businesses with urban planning processes. With a growing ICT sector and a high percentage of highly educated people living in Bristol, the city is progressing to a new knowledge economy. The pace of progress cannot be followed by all citizens, with a number of communities left behind in terms of opportunity and fitness to the new future. The city of Bristol has worked actively with communities to enable dialogue, to establish partnerships with community led organisations where they exist and to try to articulate what services the communities need, and use plans as means to provide them. However, there is a lesson learnt that new approaches are required to shift from waiting and servicing, to a more open and experimental approach to learn together with the community on how to co-create community development. With this in mind, the city of Bristol will build upon experience of bottom up community development programs that aim to shift practice and perceptions about the relations between the city and its citizens from a servicing (‘do it for citizens’) to empowerment (‘citizens do it themselves’). 
Resilience in cities.
 Cities are vulnerable to shocks and stresses that can erode and/or compromise their structures and in turn their resilience. Shocks refer to acute and sudden events of high impact to a city’s structures like an earthquake, a fire or a flooding. Stresses refer to continuous processes that erode the capacity of city’s community and structures to recover properly. A resilient city has the capacities in place to shift into a different state in the aftermath of a shock or disaster while restoring its functions and services. An ‘unresilient city’ has limited or restricted capacity to recover, and “has high poverty and crime rates and devastated natural environment, or ‘a ghost town’” (Pickett et al 2013). Cities experience the imprints of on-going transitions that are local manifestations of global transformations and relate to a variety of stresses and pressures. The post-industrialisation transition that is the result of the conflated de- and re-industrialisation processes. De-industrialisation is about escaping the industrial past with the abrupt or slow-paced phasing out of past industrial activities and the related extractive or manufacturing economies. Reindustrialization results in “the rise of new flexible forms of economic organization and productions” (Carmona et al 2003). In this process, the cities need to rethink of new uses for the vacant industrial infrastructure and on ways to capitalize on the past legacy without losing on new opportunities. A number of cities turned old industrial infrastructures as cradles for the creative industry and combined contemporary art and recreational functions to repurpose industrial blocks. Reindustrialisation includes the processes of reskilling and repurposing of knowledge and technological capitals into new economic activities, with the well-known examples of USA cities turning automobile industries into renewable energy technologies (e.g. wind-turbines and solar panel) manufacturing industries in cities. Post-industrialisation impacts the city’s structure and has place imprints, since “it involves a combination of decentralization and recentralization, the peripheralisation of the centre, and the centralization of the periphery” (Soja 1995; Carmona et al 2003). The post-capitalism transition refers to the emergence of different economic alternatives not only in terms of thinking and in terms of frames of reference like degrowth (ref. Latouche, Kallis, Kercher) or panarchy (Loorbach 2015), but also in terms of new types of markets including the sharing economy (Botsman and Rogers 2010; Schor 2014, The Economist 2015), solidarity economy, alternative currencies, and timebanks. With main expressers of the post-capitalism to having a more prominent role in the restructuring of global economy (Stiglitz; Picketty 2014) and the awakening of civil society as a global driver of new forms of socio-economic organisations, the cities also experience the ‘clash’ of the two frames of reference (capitalism and post-capitalism). Cities experience austerity policies and the roll back of the welfare state by a new class of urban poor and marginalized. In the midst of this paradigm shift, civil society organisations, grassroot actors and movements can provide knowledge on which solutions and policy interventions fit the specific context and socio-political conditions. As such can be valuable in streaming resources to solutions that have higher chances to work by bridging the fitness gap in sustainability institutions for cities (Romero-Lankao, 2012, p. 18) There are common contemporary stresses for urban resilience as co-identified with 11 cities across Europe that work on urban resilience, including: Antwerp, Bristol, Burgas, Glasgow, Rotterdam, Thessaloniki, Ioannina, Potenza, Katowice, Malmo, and Vejle. Social stresses include unemployment, urban poverty, migration, and limited access to reskilling and lifelong education/training programs. In addition to them, cultural stresses include cultural or location-driven stigmas, involvement in criminal activities and/or gangs. Social-technological stresses include digital exclusion and low education rates overall as well as in respond to new types of jobs in the knowledge and service economy. Ecological stresses include stress of climate change with a specific focus on water inundation and water stress in urban infrastructure. Social-ecological stresses include health issues due to pollution, impoverishment of urban ecosystems or limited access to urban green. All these stresses are interconnected in the way that dealing with one requires examination of how to further address the others in a more systemic and integrative manner. For example, dealing with urban poverty for example is not an issue of providing subsidies or simply “pumping money” but rather dealing with reskilling and educating people to seek and source opportunities to escape the trap of urban poverty. 
Unpacking urban resilience.
 For escaping these stresses that manifest undesirable and often persisting situations, cities need to mobilise their capacities to overcome them and create fundamentally different conditions, reflexes and ultimately situations. This requires capacities to transform from current stressful situations that challenge and deteriorate urban resilience to new states of higher resilience. Such urban renewal processes of transformation call upon the establishment and strengthening of inherent/internal dimensions of urban resilience like people-capital (individuals and communities), technological-capital (infrastructure), natural-capital (urban ecosystems, ecoscapes of the cities) and governance-capital (institutions, partnerships, rules and laws). 
People Resilience. 
People’s resilience or social resilience is conceptualized as the capacity of people to self-organise and mobilise their skills and abilities to source new opportunities and to create new forms of innovation as well as their capacity to act with solidarity in the aftermath of a disturbance. Frist, for people to be resilient, community ties and sense of community are very critical. Ojeda (2005, p.50-53) identified key elements of social resilience to be “collective self-esteem, that is an attitude of pride in the place where the community lives. Cultural identity leading to the group’s adoption of customs, values, idiomatic expressions, dances, songs, etc as defining elements, social humor, that is the ability to see the comedy in one’s own tragedy, and collective honesty, that is the decent and transparent exercise of public functions.” Adger (2000) identifies community resilience as the ability of communities to absorb shocks with and within their social infrastructures, adhering to the notion that social ties and community identities (Mira and Dumitru, 2014). Second, social resilience is also the capacity of people to act with solidarity in the aftermath of a shock that in turn will result in a social cohesive society. Citizens “should believe that in order to build a vibrant community, they would have to develop a “sense of community”, preserve their cultural integrity and consider how to best meet the needs of a local workforce” (Flint, 2013, p.105). 
Places’ Resilience.
 How cities look, their landscape context has an important effect on how they can recover and thrive from stresses and disturbances. Place includes urban ecosystems (green and blue infrastructures) and infrastructure systems (such as energy, mobility, housing). 
Urban Ecosystems.
 Cities are rich on biodiversity and have remnants of ecosystems or well manicured urban ecosystem elements in place. Urban ecosystems contribute to quality of urban environment and provide multiple ecosystem services and as such contribute to wellbeing and quality of life in a city (Muller and Werner, 2010, p.22-23). Despite the recognized benefits of urban ecosystems to citizens and to urban communities, it remains that each urban community has to self-recognise and put importance of ecosystem services in its own meaning and frame of reference. Elmqvist, Frrantzeskaki et al (2016) also address that individual cities cannot be considered “sustainable” nor “resilient” without accounting for their dependence on ecosystems and resources from other regions around the world (Folke et al. 1997, Seto et al. 2012). Urban planning therefore will need to increasingly work at urban and periurban but also regional scales while considering responsibility for the global connectivity and resource imprint of cities that influence the ability of cities to improve resilience and enable sustainability transitions (McPhearson et al., 2015). Despite the writings and case studies on urban resilience that have a spatial focus and an urban ecology background, there is a criticism that looking at place-explicit constitutions of urban resilience will be detrimental to it since urban resilience requires a holistic and systemic view. Urban inhabitants both influence and rely on resources and ecosystem services, from food, water and construction materials to waste assimilation, secured from locations around the world. The current focus on single scales when examining urban resilience is counter-productive, this includes focusing on the scale of single cities without considering the effects globally, just as it does focusing on building resilience in a particular neighborhood, without considering effects on other neighborhoods within a city. Urban resilience is a systemic property and as such needs to be examined as an interconnected concept, however understanding the way different dimensions of urban resilience and how they relate to each other in making a complex adaptive systemic configuration is also pertinent for urban action and urban planning overall. To become meaningful, urban resilience has to address scale issues appropriately. As McPhearson et al (2015) address “understanding and addressing resilience through and of urban ES may enable urban planning and governance to become adaptive and reflexive not only to external drivers (e.g. climate change extremes and vulnerabilities) but also to internal drivers. (…) For example, enabling citizens to take up initiatives for restoring green infrastructure in urban neighborhoods can act in synergy with city plans to add permeable surfaces, and in this way increase stormwater absorption/retention in urban spaces.” 
Infrastructures.
 Infrastructures are the hardware of our cities. They ensure that basic services are provided and that there is a level of service-amenities to all urban citizens. With an significant percentage of European population living in cities, future investments in infrastructures aim to improve their environmental performance as well as ensuring the creation of new businesses via the coupling of infrasystems and creating service-based economies (e.g circular economy, sharing economy). This is also a window of opportunity for rethinking how retrofitting of infrastructures can further contribute to urban resilience. There are two quality characteristics that relate with how infrastructures can ensure delivering on urban resilience in the future: robustness and adaptability. Robust infrastructures means that infrastructures maintain function over time regardless the stresses and shocks experienced. Robustness-orienting strategies focus on ‘climate-proofing to a range of possible futures” (Van Bree and van der Sluijs, 2014, p.31). This overall means that an infrastructure system continues performing in an array of changing variables and conditions and satisfies the originally identified needs that the infrasystem was constructed to provide. Adaptive infrastructures means that they are providing services that relate to social demands of today and social needs of future generations – respond to an array of social needs over time Investment in infrastructures in cities is important to consider urban sustainability since infrastructures remain for multiple generations and determine how future generations will be serviced and structured over everyday practice. Resilient infrastructures also landmark cities that can withstand shocks and stresses and are places to invest in, attracting economic/business as well as people capitals. As stated by Rees (1997) “cities are the engines of economic growth, the centres of social discourse and the living repositories of human cultural achievement, but also nodes of pure consumption and entropic black holes of industrial society”. 
Institutions for urban resilience.
 For building urban resilience, proactive leadership is paramount (Prasad et al 2009, p.9-11). It is important to anticipate shocks and understand the long-standing vulnerabilities experienced due to urban stresses. In this front, political leadership may face resistance to new measures and institutional arrangements, since long experienced stresses may not be perceived as ‘urgent matters’ to take into consideration for investing public resources and may also understood as manifestations of systemic conditions rather than as ‘resolvable issues’. For political action to be backed up, proposed actions require a multi-actor partnership from public, private and civil actors. Institutional arrangements for supporting urban resilience need to promote and enable interconnectedness, redundancy and flexibility. A way to achieve this is by forging partnerships between different social actors: public, private and civil society actors. As Flint (2013, p. 208) addresses “collaborative partnerships are a powerful way to improve communities. That is, to improve a community, we must all work together to solve problems. Even neighborhood-level change requires relationships and partnerships with entities beyond the neighborhood to optimize funding and access needed expertise and skills.” This goes beyond social synergies. Enabling collaboration between these different actors creates the conditions for resource and governance synergies (Frantzeskaki et al, 2014) that further ensure resourcefulness of social institutions. For the substantial investments in infrastructures required to more resilient cities, partnerships between different public, private and civic actors are of paramount importance (Newman et al 2009). Next to this, we also look at partnerships to revatilise urban economies. In his work on local economies, Shuman (2015, p.158) addresses that “partnerships also provide another way to think about economies of scale. (…) Partnerships offer local businesses the possibility to achieve almost any economy of scale, not through endless growth, but through carefully constructed collaborations.” For dealing with stresses and shocks effectively, intersectoral collaboration is essential. This however does not come easy in most of the city organisations. Ad hoc teams across departments that work together on the topic of urban resilience need to consider principles of good governance like trust and transparency in order to establish collaboration and source resources for common projects and seek policy/planning co-benefits. As Prasad et al 2009 (p.69) also “as a concept, intersectoral cooperation goes against the grain of most government systems. Councilors and officers, usually representing specific disciplinary areas and professional groups, may want to defend their sector’s interests and compete with each other over limited budgets. (…) Singapore, Makati City and Tokyo are among cities that provide examples of ownership by line departments with the capacity and authority to ensure proper coordination between the various agencies. Programs report to and are monitored by high level institutional mechanisms”. With the view on how different innovations or innovative actions from bottom-up initiatives maintain or enrich urban resilience, it appears to be a paradoxical finding. While bottom up initiatives are creating social capital and are the ‘pulse of urban innovation’, at the same time often focus solely on maximizing efficiency, minimize energy, and reduce redundancy and material use. Yet, redundancy is one of the hallmarks of a resilient system. Sustainability goals and resilience goals, if not examined carefully can therefore be completely at odds with each other. As Elmqvist, Frantzeskaki et al (2016) address in their recent work on urban resilience, this trade-off is a result of sustainability discussions failing to apply a cross-scale and more holistic systems approach needed to stay on a sustainability trajectory despite disturbances and the failure to recognize the cost of efficiency in designed and/or optimized systems (Frantzeskaki and Loorbach 2010). For example, additional but alternative institutional arrangements may seem redundant since they need to operate in harmony with existing institutions while satisfying same objectives. However, such designed intentional redundancies provide the necessary enabling institutional context for adaptation and transformation trajectories towards sustainable outcomes. Plurality and redundancy of institutional arrangements implies that planners should search for solutions to achieve sustainability through a co-creation process in parallel to streamlined planning processes so that multiple solutions can be experimented with across the city, i.e. through collaborative and polycentric governance. Further, by applying resilience thinking and resilience principles (sensu Biggs et al 2015), sustainability may be considerable strengthened through interlinking and analyzing numerous sustainability initiatives at multiple scales, initiatives that otherwise would just have aimed for increased efficiency and optimization often within narrow sectors. Also, clear, sustainability oriented goals will help educe the implications of high and low specific as well as general resilience. In efforts to unpack the multiple meanings that both sustainability and resilience can incorporate for an urban context, a knowledge co-creation process may be essential (Pereira et al 2015). We propose that a deliberation process for knowledge co-creation can enable locally informed and globally related meanings and understandings of both urban resilience and urban sustainability. Such a process could be particularly important for exploring designed redundancy and diversity in the urban development. Empowerment of citizens to co-design, co-create and co-produce urban places is essential so as to have a shared responsibility and accountability of the present and the future of urban resilience. As Newmann and Jennings (2008, p.159) address “empowerment and participation go hand in hand. City governments need to develop strategies for empowering people through transformation of structures and processes to enable people to participate in decision making”. Planners must also engage with a large nested hierarchy of spatial scales to take increased responsibility for motivating and implementing solutions that take into account their profound connections with, and impacts on, urban regions, other cities and the rest of the planet. Collaboration across a global system of cities could and should provide a new component of a framework to manage resource chains for sustainability through resilience. In this way, planners and policy makers can create a more inclusive process to determine which potential pathways will offer the desirable sustainability and/or resilience outcomes (Redman 2014).

"RetaiLink.
I. PRESENTATION
The RetaiLink Project.
Today, medium-sized cities are challenged by rapidly evolving consumer trends and structural changes in the retail business sector. Larger neighbouring cities that provide a more diverse economic and cultural offer tend to attract people from the surrounding areas; their broader and more attractive retail offer in turn can have an impact on the retail sector on smaller towns unless the local retailers can come up with something different, unique and special to catch the interest of local residents and visitors.
URBACT helps European cities to develop solutions for their urban challenges by means of co-creating integrated and sustainable policies that demonstrate both innovation and the broad participation of local agents.
Aligned with the programme, then, the objective of the RetaiLink project is to foster the revitalization of retail in the partner medium-sized cities*, positioning this sector as a key driver for local economic growth and job creation through the development of innovative retail strategies. In order to do so, partner cities will develop Integrated Action Plans (IAP) that will incorporate the various dimensions of retail development including consumption trends, regulation, employment, urban planning, managing public spaces, mobility, cultural and creative industries and citizens’ participation among others. 
Because the present and upcoming challenges for cities today require efforts in acting beyond individual and top-down measures, RetaiLink innovative proposal calls upon comprehensive bottom-up multi-stakeholder approach that brings together many different and relevant local retail agents in the URBACT Local Groups. ULGs will primarily comprise local public services, private business and real estate actors, cultural and creative sector entities and higher levels of government beyond the local Councils.
For the purpose of developing IAP solutions, the cities will create integrated urban policies, based on commonalities and shared goals, with long-term sustainability of the IAP initiatives in mind.
II. STATE OF THE ART.

RetaiLink’s State of the Art frames the European retail industry from different perspectives to help envision anew the topic of retail revitalisation for medium-sized cities. It explains – despite the challenges - why retail is still highly relevant, if not vital, for a mid-size city’s growth and its sustainable socio-economic fabric. But much more than this, it aims to provide a better understanding of the sector in order to give clues for public policy decision-makers who want to contribute to create an environment in the city in which retailers can thrive, compete, and innovate for the betterment of the city and its inhabitants. 
The four sections consist of:
1. Facts & figures, featuring the dimensions of the European retail economic sector in the global context and within the EU internal market. 
2. Emerging trends in retail working as drivers of the sector deep changes and forthcoming developments.
3. Regulatory aspects with regards to the local and national rules as well as the EU legal and programmatic guidelines.
4. Relevance of retailing in medium-sized cities; new approaches to respond to the challenges posed by the new trends and opportunities opened for local economic development.
A section with preliminary conclusions summarises the framework for a successful retail strategy development in medium-sized cities, which requires good leadership and an integrated and stakeholder approach. 
The information here is grounded on sector analysis, EU documents and Expert Group reports, private sector studies, as well as institutional documents and examples of good practices provided from RetaiLink project partners or found in other European (and non-EU) country sources. Numerous studies and examples exist for the success stories and interactions between retailing and local economies in bigger cities. However, it is far more difficult to find examples when narrowing down the object of study to medium-sized cities. RetaiLink’s State of the Art therefore focuses on the realities and complexities of medium-sized cities and towns since they share common traits and challenges within the unavoidable bigger pictures of international commercial, financial, technological and socio-economic change.
1. Facts and Figures: Snapshot of the European Retail Sector 
Retail is no doubt a significant sector for the European economy. One half of global retailers are European. Retail sales in the EU-27 represented in 2012 23% of the world retail turnover, equivalent to the whole of North America’s (US, Canada, Mexico). 
Having a strong stimulating role in growth and job creation retail is the largest private economic sector within EU-28 in terms of number of companies and employment rates. Accounting for 4.2% of the total EU-28 GDP, it is a significant and diverse contributor to European economy with about EUR 451 billion in value added euros. 19 million Europeans are employed in retail and 16% of young people 15-24 years of age work in the retail sector.
Despite the economic downturn experienced by most of the European countries, retail is still a sector showing growth potential. At least 19 European countries are expected to create additional jobs in retail by 2025. From the one million new retail jobs, more than half will be created in Spain and Italy, these two countries leading the ranking. 
UK, Germany, France, Italy and Spain dominate EU commerce. Eastern European countries, with an average of 11% increase in retail turnover, have taken different paths since the early 2000s when their commercial markets were relatively underdeveloped. Whereas markets in Estonia, Latvia, Slovakia and Slovenia have evolved in a way similar to the large business dominated Northern and Western Europe ones, Lithuania, Hungary and Romania have developed a commercial market populated by small, specialised companies.
2. Emerging Trends: New and Outdated Retail Models 
What follows is a brief explanation of the macro economic and social trends causing profound changes in the retail sector. It includes agents from both the global external context as well as developments inherent to the retail sector itself. These trends are captured in four areas: 
2.1 The rapidly evolving global economic and social context and how the latest economic crisis and the demographic changes impact in retailing. 
2.2 The changing retail business models that tend to increasingly concentrate in fewer brands addressed to a highly profiled customer and offering something beyond the mere action of buying. 
2.3 The new digital and ICT tools as enablers of the new retail trends and developments. 
2.4 The changes in the needs and preferences of consumers, leading to new customer-centred retail strategies. 
2.1 The global context. 
As of this writing in 2015, on the one hand, there’s been an apparent slowdown in many large economies, including China, Brazil, Russia (oil exporter) and the Eurozone due also in large part to austerity measures, falling credit markets and export-constraining regulations in countries like France and Italy. The ongoing conflict in Ukraine has also caused negative impact on the Russia-sensitive economies of Germany, Finland, Poland and the Baltic nations. On the other hand, lower oil prices have led to reductions in energy prices. These lower energy prices have translated into increased purchasing power in energy consumer countries like Japan and India, which studies show can stimulate the retail industry (Annual Report, Deloitte, 2015. Global Powers of Retailing 2015).
But in the EU, to a greater or lesser extent, all Member States have experienced the economic downturn that has ultimately impacted on the retail sector. 
A decline in consumers’ purchasing power together with behavioural changes regards the very act of consuming itself has led to a moderation in household spending and shopping, and a subsequent decline in retail sales. What’s more, the lack of credit flow as a consequence of economic stagnation has heavily impacted upon a sector that is significantly composed by a high rate of individual entrepreneurs and small companies, adding distress to an already difficult situation with repercussions outside the retail sector. Here’s an example of the negative knock-on effect: the city of Hengelo, in the Netherlands, saw a steady decrease in retail employment, it also experienced a parallel steady rise in the number of vacant retail units from 2011 (53) to 2015 (70). No jobs, no retail units needed, no income, no business, no money earned by people to spend, leading to fewer jobs needed, and around and around. 
Another global trend with relevance for European medium-sized cities’ retail sector is the current demographic developments. Today Europeans are more numerous and are living longer, they are also more urban and diverse and what is more important, they are living differently, in smaller households increasingly consisting of a single person. Finally Europeans are becoming more educated, informed and technological. All this introduces new consumers’ habits and demands, and has modified citizens’ purchasing power and preferences. 

2.2. The new retail business models 
During the 1980s and 1990s many medium-sized European cities adopted a retail model that consisted of the creation of out-of-town, large retail and leisure complexes. Displacing and fragmenting the traditional retail offer in cities, the implementation of this sub-urban model often altered the urban retail landscape with the result being that many cities saw both a sharp decline in commerce taking place in their city centres and the consequential increase in the number of vacant retail units due to the fact that small traders and service providers were forced to close down. Current local trends strongly indicate, however, that in many cities these very same shopping centres have also started to experience decay. Something’s going wrong: new business models are needed. 
The first disruption in the old model stems from the changing business models. Despite the apparent methodological differences between retailers and wholesalers, retail (selling for final consumption) and distribution are increasingly overlapping over time. The distinction between them, as well as their relation with manufacturing firms has become blurred since they are moving up and down the supply chain in real time together: retailers are gradually more producing and distributing their own products and wholesalers are moving closer to individual customers, particularly with the arrival of online shopping. Large brand specialization seems to be gaining ground in retail while the multi-brand distributors are progressively fading from view. Franchising has thus become the widespread business model, making it possible for the same brands to be found in each and every high street and commercial centre across Europe. 
The second has to do with the friction between scale and personalization. This ties into issues about the overall, ownership structures and business models, and the different size firms and supply chains use. In brief, the driving factors transforming the sector’s business models include the ICTs being applied to the sector, the search for efficiencies through economies of scale and the need for a differentiated profile before customers to be able to succeed to such scale without sacrificing the offer of the attractive “personalized” consumer experience. 
The last involves the recent developments in retailing strategies, such as multichannel selling and the technological breakthroughs and the pressures for innovation. The nature of competition is changing within and between retailing formats. Competition has morphed from being about “choice” to being about “channel”. Competition is not merely focused on the choice of products and prices but increasingly is on the shopping formats and channels, service levels, and experience offered. For example, customers enter physical shops to try on a pair of trousers but end up buying them online because they find better payment conditions through customer loyalty programs and discounts. 
In terms of employment needs, the good news is that the retail sector shows a relatively good performance addressing the skills mismatch. In keeping with the scenarios of new retail business models, the range of skills needed go beyond mostly commercial skills but continues to grow with the development of new formats and channels, especially increased demand for e-skills. 
2.3. Digitalization and ICT tools for integrated retail experience. 
Here we highlight m-commerce, e-commerce, home-shopping and home delivery made possible by technology, which encompasses a wide range of self-service and personalized support. How Europeans access products and what they expect as benefits to their health and comfort by doing so are no doubt dynamics changing the retail landscape. 
Indeed, ICT and digital tools allow an enhanced performance both in offer and on the demand side. E-commerce brings opportunities for greater efficiency since it transforms management, stimulates new business models and trading formats, and creates new jobs with new skill requirements. Consumers reap the benefits of greater convenience and price competition through loyalty marketing systems, mobile web sites and new payment platforms, which continue to transform the consumer’s experience and the efficiency of retail businesses. (Annual Report, Deloitte, 2015).
However, digitalization is mostly adopted by big companies and new retail entrepreneurs. It challenges others, in particular family or traditional micro retail local businesses, whose owners are less savvy - or even interested - about new technologies, who find it difficult to adapt to a new world of rapidly changing tools and know-how. 
Digitalization and ICT tools, including geolocation (position tracking for selected and personalised product and service offer), e-selling through PC or mobile and tablets, and new customer adapted services of delivering and collecting, contribute to a 24/7 shopping experience. The so-called omni or multichannel retailing strategies allow today’s shoppers look for retailers that deliver a seamless brand experience on- and off-line. The current notion is that those retailers with the right balance of combined solutions: online, on street outlets, click and collect, mobile applications, e-solutions in shops, together with a great customer service will be the most successful (PriceWaterhouseCoopers Consumer Survey, February 2015).
As part of the sector digitalization processes, Business Intelligence (BI) tools, applicable to many other areas domains help personalize communications to individual shoppers, i.e data mining is deeply changing the retail organisational process. In short, the extraction of intelligence from ‘big data’ helps to analyse consumer patterns and builds up consumer profiles. Information on sales, consumers’ preferences and inventory allows adapting and predicting new customers’ shopping preferences. Mobile retailing, faster retailing are part of this transformative use of BI tools. 
2.4. Customers’ behaviours and expectations. 
This fourth trend is probably the most important: the changing patterns of the consumer herself/himself - the ultimate agent that conditions the model for a retail strategy for the city. 
First of all, as mentioned, demographic and social developments are changing todays’ consumers’ habits and preferences. Let’s look closer “how” in three areas: 
Europeans are living longer and are increasingly concentrated in cities. While young people tend to move to bigger cities offering better training and job opportunities, medium-sized cities are normally the home for a higher proportion of retirees, and an older working population, with a higher share of school age children. 
This directly impacts on consumer habits and shopping patterns, i.e elderly people typically slow consumption levels and purchase less while they also need small and close convenience shops (Retailing 2020, PWC 2012) 7. That said, though, those caring for their grandchildren have new and additional shopping interests. In emerging economies, the ageing population is not so well off and may need financial support from relatives, which negatively affects the households’ overall capacity of spending. In more advanced economies, though, a significant portion of families with children in medium-sized cities do enjoy a fairly good economic position, and this acts as an economic and retail driver. 
Again, taking note of the example of grandparents: it is increasingly grandparents who pick the children in the schools in the afternoon. And it is they who spend time in the city’s public or leisure spaces, consuming entertainment and cultural goods, and shopping, too, for a whole new line of products and services. As for the younger adults, because of more and more smaller families, these consumers are demanding more simplicity and convenience in order to be able to spend more quality time for family and community concerns. In short - “take away” and “better use of energy” are “in” – “long lines” and “big refrigerators” are “out”. 
Consumers are today better educated and more informed, as well as increasingly adept at using digital technologies: consumers are more expectant to get faster and easier access to information. What’s more, to a large extent both young people and adults are taking consumer decisions based on a new range of “green” and/or “sustainability-sensitive” attitudes. As a result, they reward businesses that demonstrate themselves to be more socially responsible and environment-conscious. Indeed, new consumer values and purchasing habits are associated with such profiles and have opened up exciting new market opportunities in retail. For instance, a growing share of consumers are in favour of proximity bio products. Paradoxically maybe, even though they use “faster” information tools, they prefer “slow” shopping options, new reuse-remake-recycle usage patterns and have a growing interest in product and service traceability. 
A consequence of the mix of social changes and technological developments is the new customers’ expectations. As seen in the previous section, the disruptive effects of the digital economy on retail present immediate challenges to retail operations and profound, transformational impacts on customer purchasing behaviour. Customers show as much interest in the shopping experience as they do in the product itself.
In this regard, the unique shopping experience offers not only an adequate product range and good price but also attractive customer service and an appealing atmosphere. Retailers are increasingly steering their marketing strategies towards a consumer-centric retailing and consumer-driven supply chain. The emerging role of personal shopper, for example, is an added value in a retail company that responds to these expectations (Retailing 2020, PWC 2012).
3. Regulation, Policies and Programmes Relevant to Retail Revitalization in Medium-Sized Cities. 

This section frames the topic of retail revitalisation in medium-sized cities within the current European and national regulatory backgrounds and policies. Because retail revitalisation is influenced and touches upon a number of policies, the scope of RetaiLink’s approach lines up well with a number of policy areas that, planned and implemented at the local level, are also influenced and aligned with EU programmes and guidelines: 
Going from the broader to the more specific regulation frameworks, RetaiLink supports the flagship initiatives of the EU2020 Smart, Sustainable and Inclusive Growth strategy, among them: 
The Digital Agenda, which proposes to better exploit the potential of ICTs to foster innovation, economic growth and progress - keys to growth in the private business retail sector; 
The Innovation Union. Innovation is to a large extent a shared responsibility of the private retail sector and of the local public powers who need to create innovation-friendly environments that bring about innovative ideas to generate economic growth and jobs; 
The European Agenda for New Skills and Jobs is relevant in that the emerging retail trends call for skills upgrading to match evolving employment needs; 
Youth on the Move is important because retail employs a significant number of young Europeans and new opportunities and greater stability in the retail labour market is required. 
RetaiLink also contributes to the EU2020 Cohesion Policy Thematic Objectives (TOs) in each of the partner cities. Specifically these: 
TO3 Enhancing the competitiveness of SMEs, since the retail sector is dominated by small local retail businesses that will benefit from support in developing a more attractive offer and service. 
TO2 Enhancing access and use of ICT. Retailers will be encouraged to combine the physical with the digital aspect of retail. 
TO1 Strengthening research, technological development and innovation, mainly through proposing innovative approaches and policy solutions. 
TO8 Promoting employment and supporting labour mobility. Efforts will be allocated to support strategies for skills development that match the local sector needs. 
Finally, because retail is a business that mostly takes place in cities and its reactivation involves innovative policies and solutions at the local level, RetaiLink falls within and complements work of the urban dimension of the Cohesion Policy, particularly Articles 7 and 8 of the ERDF on Integrated and Sustainable Urban Policies and on Urban Innovative Actions, respectively.
4. New Approaches to Retailing as Opportunities for Medium-Sized Cities. 

This section presents an initial range of topics selected to be part of the RetaiLink project’s scope of work; these are acknowledged as key opportunities and consequently priority policy areas to address. Our RetaiLink network of partners includes cities from different European regions and economic and policy backgrounds, thus the network will be able to provide evidence-based solutions from diverse perspectives and approaches. The contents embed examples of the good practices from the cities in our core partnership as well as those found from other cities and networks on the topic of retail, especially as they pertain to retail revitalization and our partnership’s similar city dimensions. 
4.1 Foreword on medium-sized cities. 
Small and Medium-Sized Cities (SMUAs) in the EU receive multiple definitions and EU member states use different methods of defining cities and towns within the hierarchies of urban areas according to population size, density, functional roles and historic status. 
The Riga Declaration Towards the EU Urban Agenda8 recognises the significant role and potential for balanced territorial development of the small and medium-sized urban areas (see Annex I of the Declaration). In terms of inhabitants, 89% of EU cities have between 20,000 and 100,000 inhabitants; however, small and medium-sized cities are underrepresented in both policy and research, which tend to focus more on capital cities, second tier cities, and metropolitan areas. 
Medium-sized cities face similar challenges as their larger neighbours, but due to the limited size of their economies and human capital, and less connectivity, they face these challenges with greater difficulty. Larger urban centres may at first glance look more attractive because they offer: 
Wider choice of services; 
An attractive cultural and leisure offer; 
A public transport network with smooth connections; 
More job opportunities; 
A fuller range of shopping options. 
But medium-sized urban actors demonstrate strong advantages, too: they have higher economic performance despite lower population growth, lower unemployment rates compared to larger urban areas, as well as more affordable housing. 
4.2 Medium-sized cities and retail: Interactions and multiplier effects. 
Being highly internationalised, the retail sector is subject to the same kinds of major global changes and trends affecting cities in general. In times of economic downturn, most European cities have experienced a heavy decline of the retail sector resulting in vacant buildings, loss of footfall and fewer job opportunities. This is particularly evident in medium-sized cities, which need to now rethink their local retail models in order to provide a more attractive shopping experience.
Indeed, such are the facts that the economic and social development of the European cities is so closely intertwined with the changes that retail sector is currently undergoing; retail is recognized as a key link in the overall economic and social development of a city, and retail is the closest sector to citizens and consumers in the value chain, mean cities that blend suitable diversified retail and the wellbeing of their residents can prevent their populations from leaving for bigger cities:  
The retail activity creates business, value added and jobs (direct, indirect and induced) that weigh heavily in the national and local economies. While it is difficult to calculate an exact multiplier effect, one in four jobs are estimated to be dependent upon retail and wholesale sectors. 
Retail is also a source of direct income, through taxes in different regulatory rubrics. Local direct tax income may vary from one country to another and can be on property, sales, business activity or employee taxes, these being the most common. 
The retail sector is a strong leverage both upstream and downstream within the value chain, as the sector helps drive consumer demand for other firms’ products and services. The sector creates spill-over effects in other local activities such as bars and restaurants. 
Finally, a retail district benefits from a programme of culture and leisure activities. Besides, parades, festivals, and open air activities create a sense of place and identity for a community and thus business owners are more likely to buy in and create a sense of ownership.
4.3 Retailing as part of the city strategy. 
Broad planning strategies such as urban regeneration policies or economic development through business improvement areas are instruments that help create the initial conditions to facilitate retail revitalization in the city or a given district. But a retail strategy alone will hardly succeed without a comprehensive public policy approach that mobilises a variety of public and private stakeholders.
Urban planning is mostly a public policy led by the local authorities. The BID format, for example, involves private and public stakeholders and can be used as a potential enabling body in a particular location given that it offers a proven means of bringing local business interests and the local authority together to consider strategic changes for the town. Equally, the Development Corporation concept has been successfully used to deliver regeneration in many locations, and, typically, has had the advantage of having its own planning powers (KPMG, 2015).
The RetaiLink project well knows there is no single work approach that will solve the many challenges of revitalising the retail sector in cities. It does, though, recognize that a smart interlinking of different views, interests and expertise in retail and adjacent areas will help enable the design of a comprehensive and successful strategy for the city’s retail sector. The core issues in 4.4 are identified as critical.
4.4 Consumer-focused retail. 
The City and the retail stakeholders must understand and acknowledge customers’ new habits of consumption and preferences. Differing age ranges in retail districts, the potential local retail attraction, the tourism factor, etc. all may require adapting the typology of shops to the residents’ and visitors’ interests so as to be able to obtain a more appropriate retail mix that can provide the right product for the right consumer, in the right way, at the right price. 
Consumers require the most optimum mix of product and service offer. Some consumers shop online, others use the car for the weekly supermarket buying, and others simply buy across the street in their neighbourhood. Interesting, too, is the sea change in values, as seen in the profile of more informed and technological consumers, as well as the trends towards more responsible attitudes and values (limiting consumption, re-using, environmental and social concerns). Consumers are indeed more environmentally and socially concerned. And because consumers are better educated and better connected, they are likewise empowered to ask for greater accountability from those they buy from. Where did commodity X come from? At what environmental and social costs? Who else locally is benefitting, who else is not? 
In such a context, retailers must be aware of motivations behind behaviours and be ready to meet consumer requirements. And local policies need to be more sensitive to social and environmental demands while making sure that the local retail offer has the adequate and balanced offer of supermarkets, convenience shops, grocery stores, DIY, etc. 
4.5 Urban planning and mobility. 
Urban planning and mobility issues have often taken the lead in the ranking of priorities to address retail problems in cities. Urban improvement of a shopping district may include refurbishing city-centre public spaces, rehabilitating buildings, enabling parking areas and public transport near retail districts, street lighting, making pedestrian-only streets and promoting meeting places, among others.
With respect to the regulation aspects that the local Councils can manage and adapt towards shaping a local retail model we find opening days and hours, the use of empty buildings, local taxes or land uses. Regulations that fall short in responding to retail innovation and new proposals may negatively impact in stimulating retail activity. 
The following, from the Joseph Rowntree publication, clearly sums up the success factors in commercial urban planning: these include - a) ensuring the match between market needs and adequate retail spaces; and, b) providing shop units of appropriate sizes, ranging from big superstores to market stalls and small retail units, which will benefit from marketing advice and business support. On the contrary, the negative impact factors include c) constructing ring roads; d) creating pedestrian only zones with parking in remote lots; e) relocating municipal functions away from retail districts; f), removing street-side parking, and g) creating one-way streets.13 
One priority focus for a number of cities today, which is both cause and consequence of retail districts image deterioration, is the number of vacant units. Addressing this topic will help to better regulate retail establishments to foster competition while achieving public objectives. Some good practices on the temporary use of vacancies include cultural and civic uses as well as allocation of local stores with subsidised rents or retail incubators with both training and for-profit purposes. Overall, the joint assessment of the number, uses and eligibility of empty units have proven successful in optimizing allocation. Below are two examples of local vacancies’ management initiatives.
4.6 Business models and employment opportunities in retailing. 
The picture of the retail mix in medium-sized cities is usually one of concentration of big-box retail parks, with easy-access for cars, in the city’s outskirts. This approach has polarised the sector, diverting both workforce and footfall from the city centre. As we saw earlier, new retail business approaches can help change this picture. The mix might include offering more prestigious and selected high street retail with local products combined with global brands and a variety of shopping and leisure options that all go towards reconfiguring the local shopping experience. On top of this, convenience retailers, street markets, and grocery shops in neighbourhoods should allow residents easy access to daily basic goods. 
Harmonisation and connection of different local retail areas that are often competitors in the same city has also become a priority in many cities. Win-win situations are possible not only within a city but across cities in the same region (see 4.7 below). Cities need to find their own balance of retail typology and significance: independent retailers, chain stores, pop-up shops, outlets…
This will of course require long-term approaches and policies, and it is here where sector regulation can play a leading role in defining a retail model for the city. One that complements and differentiates individual shopping centres in the city and those in relation to other peer or bigger neighbouring cities. One that safeguards the interests of the various actors while contributing to make the city attractive for both locals and visitors.
Although large retail traders have been the main beneficiaries of exploiting economies of scale for increasing productivity and offering lower prices, the backbone of Europe’s retail business, representing over 95% are the self-employed and microenterprises (SUDOE INTERREG Project, Valencia).14 That is why the local public policies should consider offering a programme of specific business support schemes for local retail, so as to bolster economic growth and employment. Such programmes would provide easier access to investment capital, professional advice for entrepreneurs, support for innovative initiatives and the use of ICT, plus skills development opportunities (REINPO RETAIL INTERREG project).
In the skills development topic, it is increasingly evident that the offer and type of skills required are continuously changing, in particular due to the information technology. Managing and manipulating information (e.g., for rumour control), brand management e-blogs, e-newsletters, social media marketing and other forms of content to attract customers will need to develop a host of new skills, tools, and communication modes, both nimble and innovative. Moreover, increasingly integrated retail and distribution services require borrowing professionals from other areas, such as e-merchandisers, IT developers, graphic designers, web analysts and technical project managers (EU Skills Panorama, 2014).
A final word on work conditions to highlight the recruitment difficulties common in a number of countries, especially for shop sales assistants, reflecting both demand for these roles and high staff turnover. There is some reluctance of people with the necessary skills to enter these occupations for a number of different reasons, especially pay, shift work, unfavourable social hours, and work-life balance problems. 
4.7 City positioning and innovative approaches 
Throughout this paper we have affirmed that cities need to ensure their attractiveness for both retailers and consumers. Positioning the city in the regional context as a place to visit and with a unique and innovative retail offer can attract the public, prestigious brands, as well as investment from related sectors. Part of the city’s own local and regional promotion should therefore be to develop marketing strategies in collaboration with the retail sector to make such an integrated and innovative case. 
Innovative approaches to stimulate the retail sector are many and growing in creativity: these range from attractive cultural offers centred around the retail sector, coordinating street activities, races, competitions, kid extravaganzas with retail opening hours; district digitalization services that offer information and virtually-guided tours through the district’s retail offer; attractions and public events that involve community, art, concerts and sports activities. Specific solutions for retail, such as open WiFi and geo-location can be enabled in agreement with the retail sector. The possibilities for innovation are high.
The best shopping districts, lively and with plenty of customers, combine retail provision with a range of community, cultural and creative activities. The social and cultural focus reinforces the leisure and experiential side of retailing while developing a sense of place, which underpins the retail vitality. Moreover, promoting cultural activity and creative industries generates spill-over effects.
Conclusions 
The new retail market trends call for new solutions and approaches. Medium-sized cities need to develop local plans that respond to customers’ needs, preferences and expectations as well as to the rapid and profound disruptions that the retail business sector is exposed to. Retail strategies need to bring innovative ideas to respond to these challenges. 
Medium–sized cities who want to foster economic development placing retail as a central factor will need to create and embed a local plan within the broader local development strategy. Urban development, economic promotion and retail strategy need each other, and can only succeed if they agree on a broad mid- or long-term vision. 
Short-term aspirations and small and scattered projects, with a lack of vision, and lack of consensus on future aspirations, ignoring the need to achieve economic, social and environmental objectives simultaneously will most likely lead to failure in achieving sustainable solutions. 
To begin with, the local plan will require a detailed study of the political and economic context of the city and the retail district, current global and local retail trends in the city and a measured knowledge of the residents and visitors habits and preferences. Only by clarifying the starting point and the measurement indicators will it be possible to understand the real impact of the local plan on retail. 
Instrumental in fostering new local policies and governance and facilitating new solutions will be, among others, special partnership vehicles with public-private stakeholders, participative processes in planning and decision-making and strong leadership. Cities need to lead the process where retail stakeholders sit down together to agree on a strategy which brings opportunities for local retailers and which benefits local consumers, local producers and land owners altogether. The task is for both the private and the public sector but primarily it will rely on the smart combination of joined forces, expertise and the stakeholders’ collective will.

"ROMA-Net.
INTRODUCTION.
The thematic focus of the ROMA-Net project closely echoes the recent trends in social inclusion policy for Roma which recognise the important role of cities and municipalities in the development and implementation of social inclusion policies. The trans-national context of ROMA-Net recognises that Roma exclusion is a multi-national issue which spans beyond the boundaries of single nations and at the same time the City partnership approach reflects the commitment and need for action at local level to achieve relevant and sustainable results. Budapest City Council, with other partners in a network of European cities was successful in securing access to funding from the URBACT II programme for the development and operation of a thematic network. ROMA-Net is a thematic network of 9 Cities that will establish a programme of trans-national exchanges to compare policy planning experiences of URBACT partners, and others, and to share tangible and sustainable local practices. The activities of ROMA-Net will strengthen capacity at City level through professional learning and development and will contribute to the continued dissemination and expansion of the European knowledge base on Roma inclusion. ROMA-Net will support city policy-makers, practitioners, social service providers, managers of operational programmes and research institutes to develop action plans for local integrated sustainable development practices and policies for Roma communities that are relevant to the situation and identified need in each partner city. The European Parliament’s resolution of 31 January 2008 stressed the importance of involving local authorities in ensuring the effective implementation of efforts to promote Roma inclusion and combat discrimination. The same resolution called on Member States to involve the Roma community at grassroots level with a view to empowering the Romani people to fully benefit from the incentives provided by the EU aimed at promoting their rights and the inclusion of their communities, whether in the field of education, employment or civic participation. Successful and sustainable inclusion and integration favours a bottom-up approach which emphasises joint responsibilities and places significant importance on the development of human resources and professional capacity, factors that are at the core of the ROMA-Net partnership.
1.1. The ROMA-Net Partnership.
The partners in the ROMA-Net project include a mix of cities from competitiveness and convergence regions of Europe which bring different perspectives to the operational reality of Roma inclusion. The legal status of the Roma minority differs across Europe from country to country and from group to group. The largest numbers of Roma are nationals and resident in countries that are now members of the European Union such as Romania, Bulgaria, Czech Republic and Slovakia. They are entitled to free circulation as European citizens, but in some other Member States they lack full rights as workers. Their status is related to the period of migration, and recognition in each country as an ethnic or national minority. Some groups from long-established patterns of migration are now citizens of the country where they live and are either national minorities or ethnic minorities and have full citizenship. In the same countries other groups are considered refugees or asylum-seekers and have no residency permits; in other countries they are considered asylum-seekers/refugees, but not in the condition to obtain the status. The legal status of the Roma minority differs across Europe from country to country and from group to group. The ROMA-Net partnership changed significantly from the beginning of the development phase to the end. The first phase partnership: Budapest, Amadora, Heraklion, Karvina and Udine was extended by three partners very early in the development phase when in December 2009 Almería, Bologna and Timisoara confirmed their participation. These three new member cities joined the others and concluded the local mapping exercise. After discussions with the representatives of DG EMPL and DG Regio, further efforts were made to involve another partner from either Slovakia or Bulgaria. In April 2010 the City of Kosice in Slovakia, confirmed that the city had officially approved and support their commitment to join the ROMA-Net partnership. In May Amador withdrew from the Partnership, largely because the senior local authority official has a new appointment and felt that the city does not have the capacity or commitment to continue with ROMA-NeT. They Timisoara stated they are unable to fulfil their intention to join ROMA-Net in Phase II. The reason they cited was that they do not have the internal capacity to administer and manage the project and due to a freeze on hiring in the public sector they cannot employ additional staff, also that the level of financial remuneration was not sufficient to make external arrangements. By the middle of May the Lead Partner and the Lead Expert managed to secure the participation of two other cities - Glasgow and Torrent - which completed the partnership of 9 cities from 7 countries (4 partners from convergence area and 5 from competitiveness and employment area). Both cities have Roma communities, which are affected by a mix of similar issues as the other members of the partnership. Both Cities face challenges in the effective delivery of services to the community and both believe that an integrated approach is the way forward. From ROMA-Net they hope to share experiences of international good practice and to have the support of other members Cities for the development and implementation of local action plans. The URBACT II Programme consists of two operational phases. Phase 1 focuses on situation analysis, and on the design and development of a solid foundation of local partnership and commitment to participation in the preparation and production of a local action plan Phase 2 is dedicated to maintaining local participation and engaging key actors in the step by step process of building and then implementation of a local action plan. The information contained in the Baseline also contains information gathered during the development phase when both Amadora and Timisora were committed to remaining in the project in Phase II. Their late departure meant that the two new partners had insufficient time to conclude a full local mapping before the end of the development phase. Both Cities are now working on the local mapping as the situation analysis to underpin future actions. The Roma communities that are represented in the ROMA-Net cities fall into three different settlement models. Most cities have a mix of different groups: Cities where the Roma population are descendents of migration that took place many generations ago. The people are mostly nationals of their country of residence, living a settled, but usually segregated life of poverty and exclusion in a specific area of the city. In some cases people do not have identity or property documents, even although they are living in the country of their birth. Almeria, Bologna, Budapest, Heraklion, Torrent and Udine fall into this category. Cities that receive economic migrants from other usually rural parts in their own country, or neighbouring countries and who come for temporary work or to beg but who only stay for a period of time and then move on to a another city. Bologna, Budapest, Heraklion, Almeria are in this category. Cities where the Roma population includes immigrants, usually economic migrants, that have come from new member states in search of work and better living conditions either as asylum seekers during the time before EU membership or as economic migrants since EU accession. Some are fairly recent arrivals like Bologna and Glasgow and others such as Karvina and Udine have been there for about fifty years. In Udine the Roma population may have migrated from surrounding countries at the beginning of the Twentieth Century , but the current population are Italian citizens and have been settled in the city for more than years. Cities where the Roma is made up mainly of immigrants that have come from non-EU countries as asylum seekers, and now they have either temporary residency or permanent residency in the country Bologna have a population from the former Yugoslavia and the Balkans but there is no known Roma section of this population. The ROMA-Net Partnership that are committed to go forward into Phase II are made up of the following cities that are made up of a mix of competitiveness and convergence regions. The URBACT II Programme consists of two operational phases. Phase 1 focuses on situation analysis, and on the design and development of a solid foundation of local partnership and commitment to participation in the preparation and production of a local action plan Phase 2 is dedicated to maintaining local participation and engaging key actors in the step by step process of building and then implementation of a local action plan. 
SYNTHESIS OF PARTNER PRIORITIES.
5.1 Common problems identified during the local mapping.
Regardless the size or locality, it is interlinked and intergenerational factors that are at the root of the social and economic exclusion experienced by Roma in Europe, and also in the ROMA-Net partner cities. For many it means poverty, discrimination, unemployment or informal exploitative work, dependency on social assistance, low or no educational attainment, poor health and inadequate living conditions often without legal tenure. There is quite a variation in Roma population size in the partner cities, for example Budapest is estimated to have more that 60,000 and Udine with only several hundred. The baseline however exposed that there is a strong commonality in the issues across all Cities in fact the small communities appear almost as a microcosm of the large ones. Insufficient and inadequate data exists at local or national level making it impossible to accurately quantify with accuracy the scale of and intensity of the poverty and exclusion that exists in the local Roma populations. The absence of disaggregated data on Roma is common across much of Europe and in all our partner cities. Like most policy and programme makers we have to rely on empirical evidence, local expertise and best estimates. The local mapping reveals findings that are broadly similar to sampling exercises carried out elsewhere and they confirm that the exclusion issues are deep rooted, interconnected and complex. A snapshot of the common and city specific problems that were highlighted during the local mapping exercise are as follows: GENERAL. Common issues for the Roma populations – discrimination and negative views by the majority population, direct and indirect discrimination. Specific issues for the Roma population - Roma blamed for anti-social behaviour. Lack of understanding and respect for the Roma culture and history. Common issues for the Cities – overcome the negative attitudes of the majority population, improved consultation and engagement with the Roma community. Build tolerance and mutual respect. Specific issues for the cities – very negative attitudes from neighbouring residents. 
EDUCATION. Common issues for the Roma populations - Low levels of educational attainment and attendance, low literacy levels. Language barriers. Discrimination. Specific issues for the Roma population - Early school departure, especially with girls dropping out before finishing even basic education. Common issues for the Cities - Roma negative attitude to education, both in relation to attainment and school attendance. Specific issues for the cities – challenges to keep young people in education; how to overcome the lack of aspirations and low expectations of young people; home environment not suitable for study; discrimination. HEALTH. Common issues for the Roma populations - Exclusion from critical social services, especially health. Discrimination. Specific issues for the Roma population - Unable to gain access to basic health care, no residency rights or official registration means failure to even qualify for general healthcare. Common issues for the Cities - Often no health provision/centres close to Roma living areas. General poor health of Roma seen by majority population as self inflicted because of lifestyle choice and therefore unsympathetic and even animosity to targeted Roma health issues. Specific issues for the cities - Roma ignorance of health services that are available and accessible to them. One city has been quite successful with a Roma targeted medical centre. HOUSING. Common issues for the Roma populations: - Isolation, lack of reliable transportation network, often living with no residency rights, ghetto conditions, lack of basic amenities; including gas, electricity and proper sanitation. Discrimination. Some city specific issues - Drug related crime, severe overcrowding, living unlawfully on unregulated camp. Common issues for the Cities: - Some attempts at social housing initiatives for integration, with varying outcomes but mainly negative. Specific issues for the cities - Drug related crime, Roma populations living on the street, shelters and illegally causing police involvement and intervention for Roma safety or criminal activity detection and prevention. Residency rights and property rights, illegal camps and housing land disputes. EMPLOYMENT. Common issues for the Roma populations - Deterioration of traditional work opportunities, ill-equipped and unqualified to participate in the new job market. Informal work contact; lack of work opportunities for young people. Discrimination. Specific issues for the Roma population - No access to financial credit for entrepreneurs small/medium business; lack of training/re-training opportunities. Common issues for the Cities - In many the industrial restructuring and the decline of heavy industries have severely cut employment opportunities and where new industries have emerged they require a higher skill based employee.  Specific issues for the cities - a generous state social welfare system is blamed as an obstacle which de-motivates and discourages Roma from going into work. Given the scale for some cities and the complexity of the issues in all cities, the partners acknowledged that ROMA-Net needs a clear focus and an overarching theme within which ROMA-Net activities will broadly concentrate. 5.3 Scope of the Overarching Theme. Therefore using best estimates and extensive local knowledge the ROMA-Net partners agreed an overarching theme to bring focus and concentration for all actions but at the same time to be sufficiently inclusive to encompass and incorporate the broad scope of complex issues that have to be addressed in each city. The phrase to describe ROMA-Net is as follows: ROMA-Net is a transnational partnership to inform and support its City partners to develop local action plans that facilitate better services, through improved access and an integrated approach, to support young Roma adults in their transition into social included, active adult citizens. Change will come from a step-by-step inclusive approach. As ROMA-Net partners, young adults will motivate positive acceptable change and provide insight into the barriers and challenges caused by exclusion and discrimination. The theme provides focus and clarity for future actions, but also allows for a complex approach that crosses all the key priority areas of education; health; employment and housing/ land. The overarching theme for the project activities can be justified on many levels as it offers a number of clear advantages and opportunities for both the focus group and the partnership. These are as follows: for the focus group are as follows: the activities concentrate on the period of time when young adults have to make some of the most crucial decisions that will affect the rest of their lives; it should be possible to identify the key services that young people most need during this time of their life and then to improve access to existing services or create new ones to fill the gaps in provision; by creating active positive interventions to engage and support this group we have the potential to shape, influence and sometimes re-direct the decisions that young people may make; through this group we hope to influence the wider family networks, such as children as this is the time many Roma women will start having children. The housing/ land tenure rights of their parents, as many of this group will continue to reside with their extended families; this is the age when people are most motivated for change and have the energy to drive change –this dynamic is needed to get behind the project. It will motivate the local support groups to think about interventions that are modern, that support the decisions that young Roma adults have to make during these critical years and that communicate and engage young people; It provides a clear focus to engage and negotiate with service providers/ employers etc. It provide a common link with Roma who have migrated to the city from elsewhere, mostly second (and some first and third) generation. Some are from other parts of the same country, from another country or who are the current generation of a previously nomadic group. This factor creates another common link across the ROMA-Net partners. The local mapping exposed that many services are already being supplied by the local authority and other public service providers, but they are not having sufficient or visible impact on the Roma population. Although there is no hard evidence, it is acknowledged that without a mix of anti-discrimination components and some targeting, mainstream services and special initiatives fail to reach or engage the Roma populations. This is especially limiting for young Roma adults, many of whom do not have adequate support at the time when they make some of the most important decisions of their lives. The overarching theme will also encompass a number of sub-themes, namely : 2nd Generation Migrants – will be the bulk of the target group ; The age to build aspiration – creating new expectations ; Community Building – using the motivation of the young ; Influencing Change to improve existing practices. The level of community engagement is generally under-developed. The partners believe that community participation, community buy-in to the process; community commitment; community development can be furthered by harnessing the energy of young men and women. All ROMA-Net cities agree that community engagement is a horizontal and core principle that has to run across all components and through all activities of the project, at trans-national and local level. The EU and international policy context provides a supportive and relevant environment for ROMA-Net activities, as it has made a fairly recent shift to recognise the critical role that local authorities have in the implementation and absorption of complex multi-sectoral approaches for Roma. So far, much of the practical implementation experience at local level as been with NGOs this will not however be lost as local organisations will have a critical role in all local actions. They can significantly boost local capacity and will be essential for successful local implementation of ROMA-Net activities. They will be members  of the local support groups and participants in the learning exchange clusters and/ or in the people to people exchange activities foreseen in phase II of the project. Most Roma populations in the partner cities are second, some first generation migrants. The common factor for many is that they do not have family roots in the city as they or their parent came to the city from somewhere else. For example, in the case of Karvina, they were part of the industrial migration as part of the communist labour force; in Budapest it has been migration from rural areas to urban mainly in search of work; in Udine they are settled families that were previously travellers in Italy; Bologna has the mix of new wave of eastern European migrants; and relatively recently settled Sinti population. Although the antecedents for many young Roma adults are not always strongly tied to their current city of residence, many were born or have lived in the city for a considerable portion of their life and are creating roots within the city. In acknowledgement the City’s should ensure that the support and services are available to allow young Roma adults to make active and informed choices that will improve their quality of life. Choices that with a step by step inclusive approach can create active engaged citizens that make a positive contribution to enhance the diversity and add significant value to the city as a whole. 
5.3 The Overarching Theme and Local Action Plans.
The theme does not limit actions in other areas but provides the context for the bulk of activities and interventions that will be included in the local action plan. For example, it has to include service for children as it is the women within the scope of the ROMA-Net focus group that will be having children. In term of housing / land / accommodation tenure this is a whole family issue that will have an impact on the life of the young person, directly or indirectly. Services that work for young people and also there parents are most likely for this case. Facilitate better access to services. The term does not mean simply providing information about what services are available/ or even helping people to make use of the services. The context is much more about : looking at what services are available; identifying gaps in provision and taking action, in partnership, to close these gaps; guaranteeing the relevance of the service in its present format; making adjustments or additional components to improve the relevance and accessibility of the service; informing and empowering the young people to make better use of the services to support their lives; bridging the gap between the service providers and the community – increasing understanding from both sides. Type of actions under each key priority. The priority actions that could emerge in the local action plans could be under the following types of interventions. Health will not include delivery but much more on health promotion of preventative measures and provision of information and age relevant guidance such as sexual wellbeing, family planning, Education –there were two categories of formal and non formal. Formal – the role will be challenging the current education methods; and influencing change (by bringing in alternatives and educating teachers to better more relevant teaching practices. Non formal – encompasses the supply free time activities with an education orientation which will be seen also as an empowering too for the young people; provision of support education services for example for children of the target group or parents of the target group. Also education in other areas such as rights, crime prevention etc, Employment: in the format of training for work ; support for starting career ; engaging employers ; formalising employment, ie legal contracts ; Housing – two sub categories related to physical and allocation/ placement : Physical – the legal title for land, accommodation. Planning for the physical regeneration and rehabilitation or housing stock. Allocation/ placement - ensuring integrated placement practices are available; better understanding how housing policy limits housing choices; empowering young people about the housing choices they make; finding housing; providing/access to information; promoting the ability to defend/ challenge housing decisions. 
5.4 Thematic Exchange and learning themes. 
ROMA-Net will implement three learning clusters designed to provide local support groups with increased know-how, with the necessary tools to tackle the complexity of issues that have been identified during the baseline research and local mapping. The learning aims to make local support groups more effective in the development and the implementation of their local action plans. Within each learning cluster there are three inter-connected topics where the exchange and learning will concentrate. Community engagement - including participatory activities / tools; anti-discrimination awareness; social marketing; Integrated and area based approach to tackling exclusion and segregation including the application of an area based approach; innovative approaches to tackling segregation using housing improvement; and inclusive approaches to area regeneration. Building a transitional labour market – creating, supporting and using an intermediate labour market; the role of the social economy/ social firms ; justification using social accounting and audit. The three exchange and learning clusters will: contribute to a continuous and expanding cycle of learning in each partner city and in each local support group. Each event will build and complement the knowledge and insight gained in previous events; prepare and disseminate tools and guidelines to the cities that will support and underpin their work within the URBACT Local Support Groups to build a step by step, integrated and area based approach to social and economic inclusion of Roma, with a focus on young adult Roma; and maximise the impact of the trans-national exchange on the local activities in the partner cities through a feedback and reporting structure after each international event. Development of the local action plan will be more effective if a robust project development methodology is applied during planning and implementation. ROMA-Net has made provision for local support groups to learn the principles of PCM - project cycle management. The baseline provides the situation analysis to understand the wider strategic context for the local action plan. The priorities set out in associated operational programmes should provide strong indications of the priorities that should also be incorporated and reflected in local action plans. Each local support group, with the help of the managing authority members, will review the content of the Operational Programmes to find the relevant priorities that match the aims of local action plans. We envisage that the Regional Operational programmes and the Human Resource Development Operational programmes, in each country will provide the essential funding stream to ensure that the local action plans generated by ROMA-Net local support groups are translated into real and sustainable actions. Where appropriate we will maximise opportunities and coordinate between ERDF, ESF and EARDF at regional and local levels. Indications are that the recent European Parliament decision, 18 May 2010, and amendment to regulation 1080/ 2006 Article 7 will be of crucial importance for the future activities of the ROMA-Net partner cities. The amendment to the regulation is very recent, and how it is translated into national programmes will obviously have a bearing on the relevance and accessibility of assistance at local level. However the indications are that the changes are very much in line with what we already foresee as the integrated area based approach that will emerge in the local action plans that will be developed and implanted in ROMA-Net cities. The ROMA-Net partnership was consolidated at a trans-national meeting in Budapest on 17 and 18 May 2010. The meeting provided the opportunity to introduce the new composition of the partnership, for new partners to meet each other and to share experiences. The meeting provided the opportunity to fully engage and to discuss the proposed Phase II work programme, the supporting budget and to agree clear aims and objectives for future activities.

"ROMA-NeT II.
Roma-NeT II’ offers an opportunity for partners to build on previous experience to find new and innovative ways to develop a deeper understanding of and create capacity and know-how for cities in tackling Roma integration.

INTRODUCTION 
The Roma-NeT Action Planning Stage; which took place with nine partners over a three year period from 2010-2013; proved an invaluable learning experience for all partners. This project consolidated the importance of cities in dealing with Roma Integration and played its part in pushing Roma policies further up the list of priorities for senior policy-makers and governmental organisations. In fact, since Roma-NeT began, a number of policy changes have developed; even though the situation and living conditions for many Roma in Europe has not. 
Specifically, while partner cities developed Local Action Plans (LAPs) in partnership with their own key stakeholders, there was an apparent push at EU level to highlight the disparities between Roma communities and others in EU Member States. This was evidenced through the demand for and creation of National Roma Integration Strategies, research now being undertaken by the Fundamental Rights Agency and partnerships that have grown in Roma specific projects such as ROMACT. 
The Roma-NeT Action Planning Stage was not solely responsible for these positive changes in policy-making, but it certainly contributed in its own way. From the outset, partners understood the importance of communicating the project findings to the right people in the right places to further influence the Roma Integration agenda. 
Six partners: Almeria, Bologna, Budapest, Glasgow, Nagykallo and Torrent; have agreed to continue their journey as part of the Pilot Development project of Roma-Net- Roma-NeT II. They have not only found the Action Planning Stage beneficial, but have continued to use the tools they learned about to develop and action their LAPs in the interim period between each phase. ‘Roma-NeT II’ offers an opportunity for partners to build on that work and find new and innovative ways to develop a deeper understanding of and create capacity and know-how for cities in tackling Roma integration.
WHY IS ROMA INTEGRATION IMPORTANT IN THE EU? 
It is nowadays well-recorded in the policy areas that the Roma population across Europe is estimated to be between 10-12 million and remains the biggest group of people to be living in unacceptable poverty and with extensive discrimination. 
This is not a new problem, but the recent and serious interest at policy level in how to change the situation is. For decades, the desperate situation of Roma has not been dealt with and has largely been ignored at both policy and operational level. 
Historically, where projects and programmes of work have been implemented on the ground, all too often they have created and encouraged a segregated approach to housing, education, healthcare and employment. For the most part, this has further removed the possibility of any new opportunities for Roma to become integrated with the wider community and has led to further discrimination across all of these key thematic areas. 
Since the fall of communism over 20 years ago across much of Eastern Europe, the situation of Roma has deteriorated even further. The economic crisis has also provided ample opportunities for Western and Eastern European citizens to use Roma as a scapegoat as migration patterns change. A new and increased freedom of movement has contributed to a heightened sense of xenophobia in many European cities. 
In many cities and towns, Roma still live in segregated housing, ghettoised from the wider population. With no access to utilities or other services their poverty is dramatic and disturbing – particularly in a 21st century Europe. 
Discrimination starts in education and leads to systemic exclusion from anything other than low-skilled employment in the labour market. Roma women are discriminated against both due to gender and race. Conversely, this lack of engagement of working-age Roma means that EU Member States are missing out on a crucial contribution to the development of their economy, as the Roma population represents a sizeable share of the working age population of some Member States. 
The movement of more Roma to Western European countries is a significant factor in highlighting Roma integration policy in the EU. It is this push and pull factor that has meant more Member States have taken an interest in this policy area and; although appalled at the continued living conditions of Roma in some new Member States; have had to look at their own social inclusion practices and ways to create access to public services for all in their societies. 
It has taken significant effort and time by Roma activists, NGOs and civil society to begin the creation of a policy environment where Roma integration is not just highlighted but prioritised. More Member States and policy-makers need to take time to fully engage and to understand the complex nature of integrating Roma and capitalising on the strengths that this heterogeneous population will bring to the wider communities in which they live. The gap between policy and what is being implemented on the ground needs to be shortened if making a difference to real people’s lives is to happen.
GENERAL CONTEXT. 
Since 2005 when the Decade of Roma Inclusion was announced there have been significant developments in the policy arena around Roma inclusion policy. Operationally though, there is little evidence of real change in most areas. Some good practice is emerging that appears to be have a positive impact on the lives of many Roma, but changing the lives of the 10-12 million people who have been actively discriminated against for centuries, has to be part of a long-term plan. 
In 2008, the first EU-held Roma summit produced the 10 Common Basic Principles to address Roma inclusion. These are a guide to countries and institutions in how to design and implement new policies and activities. 
This was followed by EU communications to Member States on the social and economic integration of Roma. These communication reminded Member States of their special responsibility towards Roma who live in all Member States, candidate countries and potential candidate countries. 
In 2010, the European Commission established an Internal Task Force to assess how Member States used EU funding in relation to the social and economic inclusion of Roma. 
A key policy turning point was when the EU communicated to Member States its proposal for an EU Framework linking National Roma Inclusion Strategies to the process and goals of Europe 2020. This showed the EU’s intention that Roma integration would be a cornerstone in future policy-making; and therefore funding; to Member States. All Member States were required to develop their own targeted and integrated approach to the specific themes of education, health, housing and employment in 2011. 
During the Roma-Net Action Planning Stage, the policy context for Member States developed further. In 2012, the European Commission’s ‘National Roma Integration Strategies: A First Step in the Implementation of the EU Framework”, provided an assessment of all 27 strategies provided by Member States along with a set of policy recommendations that member states were expected to address in order to meet their special responsibilities towards Roma and towards the goals of Europe 2020. 
The most recent EU guidance on ex-ante conditionalities for European Structural and Investment (ESI) funds sets out the thematic ex-ante conditionalities that apply, including a condition referring to Roma Inclusion (A10-2). It allows for ESF and ERDF investment in ‘integration of marginalised Roma communities’ and the ex-ante conditionality is that ‘a national Roma inclusion strategic policy framework is in place that, in summary:
sets achievable national goals for Roma integration to bridge the gap with the general population across ll thematic areas. 
identifies disadvantaged micro-regions or segregated neighbourhoods, where communities are most deprived 
includes strong monitoring methods to evaluate the impact of Roma integration actions. 
is designed, implemented and monitored in close cooperation and continuous dialogue with Roma civil society, regional and local authorities. 
The most recent information about EU Structural Funds suggests that every Member State should have Roma Inclusion priorities in their Partnership Agreement for the 2014-202 programming period. This change should bring significant opportunitites and increased access to resources. The challenge for cities is to turn those opportunities into concrete programmes that actually reach, and start to deliver better qualities of life in local Roma communities.

EMERGING PRACTICE ACROSS THEMATIC AREAS. 
The partners involved in Pilot Development Project of Roma-Net - Roma-NeT II can learn much from emerging practice in the integrated approach but also from recent practice across the key themes of Roma exclusion. 
EDUCATION. 
The Roma Education Fund (REF) funds extensively a range of projects and programmes that work towards integration of Roma in educational establishments and to give opportunities to those who have occasionally made it through secondary school. A dedicated fund like REF can have real impact in one area whilst keeping connections to other themes. Education is also at the heart of much that should be done to make change happen. 
A good education leads to better employment prospects, and a real route of poverty not just for one individual but potentially for their entire family. This in turn creates positive roles models for others and opportunities being thought possible that might not have been considered previously. 
As with many significant funding pots, not all REF projects may have completely fulfilled all of their original goals, but the sheer turnover of these projects concentrated in education means that lessons can be learned quickly and new and improved projects can be created out of them. 
HEALTH. 
An interagency programme has been set up to promote the right to health of the Roma population, particularly Roma children and women. The initiative delivers on the commitment to promote health equality and focus attention on the most disadvantaged population groups at the High-level Plenary Meeting of the sixty-fifth session of the United Nations General Assembly (September 2010). 
The initiative focuses on the twelve countries currently taking part in the Decade of Roma Inclusion, namely Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Montenegro, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, Spain and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. Some additional countries may also be included in the future. The key partners are the WHO, United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), UNDP, UNICEF, and International Organization for Migration (IOM). 
The initiative applies the principle of explicit but not exclusive targeting, which implies focusing on socially disadvantaged Roma as a target group but not to the exclusion of other populations or groups experiencing poverty and social exclusion. It will engage Roma and other civil society partners as active partners and build the capacity of partnering agencies to address Roma health through coordinated action. 
HOUSING. 
It still appears that the examples that come from the Spanish partners in RomaNet, Almeria and Torrent, provide some of the best examples of integrated housing initiatives. Beyond that it is difficult to find any positive examples especially outside Spain. Given the scale of the housing problem for Roma this is really quite extraordinary. Many Roma communities are still fully segregated from the wider community in ghettoised slums. The conditions they live in are appalling. Persuading some municipalities that integrated living is the answer still remains a difficult discussion when such a strong institutionalised hatred of Roma exists in some European cities. 
Although not recent examples, some of the better case studies of developing better housing for Roma are in Spain. Initial slum clearances were often badly implemented and had mixed results. However, more recent and long-term effort has reduced the percentage of Roma living in sub-standard housing from 31 percent to around 11 percent during the last two decades. 
In Madrid, The Rehousing and Social Integration Institute purchases units on the second-hand housing market, renovates them and then rents them out to the families participating in the program. This programme works closely with the Roma families involved to make the move as smooth as possible and offers other support. 
EMPLOYMENT.
The FRA’s survey ‘ The Situation of Roma in 11 Member States’ found that over 65% of working-age Roma are unemployed. This lies at the heart of much of the poverty and feeds discrimination from others. 
The European Social Fund (ESF) which is available in many of the countries where Roma are most badly affected by high-levels of unemployment; is available to extend employment opportunities, invest in jobs and skills, and create a skilled and adaptable workforce. But ESF is best used for large-scale programmes and not for small-scale local projects. Many of the larger programmes provide training and access to low-skilled labour and very often they do not reach out-of- work Roma living in segregated areas. It is clear that these programmes often follow similar patterns and that employability projects do require more innovation to have a bigger impact. 
One of the most successful programmes to create training and jobs for Roma, and other disadvantaged groups, is the Acceder programme in Spain. Following regional pilots programmes it has now become a national programme and has been successful in offering an integrated approach for Roma and other disadvantaged groups routes to employment. Since its inception in 2000, it has supported 200,000 Roma into jobs. 
Jobs and Business Glasgow (UK) run a similar set of programs to create a supported pathway to employment for new arrival Roma in Glasgow, funded jointly by ESF and local authority funding.1 The project provides pre-employment labour market guidance; followed by skills training for work, then on to paid employment to build skills and to prepare for a move to the real labour market. Several Roma are also employed within the organisation, graduating from training schemes and helping others in a similar situation. 
In the Czech Republic, an innovative localized partnership programme is being run by the NGO, IQ Roma Servis in Břeclav Municipality. The project works with the local municipality, Labor Office, Schools, Libraries and crucially with employers as well as with the local disadvantaged community of Roma. It involved a ‘bigger picture’ approach towards social inclusion, key components of which are education and employment.
TO SUM UP 
The Pilot Development Project of Roma-Net and now Roma-NeT II brings six partners from the Roma-NeT Action Planning Stage back together to share in learning exchange and move forward with their LAPs and LSGs. Where the Roma-NeT Action Planning Stage changed the way many of these partners worked within their municipalities, the Pilot Development Project of Roma-Net - Roma-NeT II hopes to consolidate this learning and focus on two significant areas to create change: 
Innovation for employability of working-age Roma and Communication for change .
Working in this focused way, using intensive and interactive workshop methodologies is expected to create social innovationary practices for all six partners and their LSGs. These six partners will continue to share their learnings with others and eventually create a ripple effect with other cities over time, who will be able to draw on innovative and emerging practice to achieve positive integration with Roma communities in the future.

"RUnUP.
The Role of Universities for Economic Development in Urban Poles.

I EXECUTIVE SUMMARY.
Since the Lisbon European Union Spring Council of 2000 set a strategic goal for the European Union to become the most dynamic and competitive knowledge based economy in the world by 2010 there has been significant research, policies and projects on how to stimulate the knowledge economy and importantly the importance of Universities within Triplex Helix Structures. Cities are widely recognised as playing a fundamental role in the promotion of the knowledge economy but most research and policy has focussed on large cities with World‐class educational and research institutes and advanced clusters of economic activity. There are clear and significant gaps in the knowledge of how smaller sized cities, with different levels and types of knowledge institutions and different levels of economic activity can compete within the Knowledge Economy. Yet such cities are recognised within European Union policy as playing a vital role in the implementation of the Lisbon agenda. The URBACT II Thematic Network RUnUP addresses in a uniquely different way the fundamental issues of how universities should engage with their local communities with a particular focus on medium‐sized cities; the role of local authorities and municipalities and the importance of triple helix structures for supporting economic development and encouraging entrepreneurship. The partners within the RUnUP network cover cities with populations between 50,000 and 200,000 inhabitants, with either; no university, an underperforming university or a world class university and education system. In each case the fundamental reason for their participation in RUnUP is consistent, namely to enhance the role of the university within the city and its direct and indirect benefits to local economic development. This baseline report is the result of 6‐months work during the development phase of the network in which the state of art has been produced highlighting the importance of the knowledge economy, the role of universities and research centres and the changing remit of municipalities and local authorities in triple helix structures. The partner profiles are the result of significant work and communication between the lead partner, lead expert and network partners. Each has been produced with information from each partner and edited following the visit of the lead expert to each city during the development phase. As a result of this work it is evident that the RUnUP network has a distinctive approach, which has and will continue to enable: The understanding of the concrete needs of each partner city in relation to its existing economic base and the ‘absorptive capacity’ of its firms, allowing us to map out strategies for the partner cities each with different economic starting positions. The alignment of university activity to economic transformation. Recognising that the traditional linear model of seeing universities as producers of knowledge from research and conversion into technology transfer and developing spin‐outs is extremely limited. Universities can undertake much wider roles in local economies many of which are more aligned to the focus of small and medium‐sized cities. The activities of RUnUP will extend and highlight the range of alternatives regarding the role of Universities in such environments. • A focus on the practical role that local authorities can play in Small and Medium‐Sized Cities as the vital interface between the needs of economic actors and the knowledge base. An approach for studying good practice both within and outside the RUnUP partners which will allow the network to provide practical guidelines for city managers while at the same time producing general policy recommendations to strengthen a vital component of the Lisbon Strategy. Moving forward into the implementation phase at a local level it is recommended that the partners in the RUnUP network need to enhance their individual and organisational knowledge of their local and regional knowledge based institutions. Only by understanding the structures, key contacts, key research and educational themes and existing approaches of universities to working with their local economy can they support the development of triple‐helix structures and the alignment of university activity to local economic development priorities. In parallel with this the partners as a prerequisite to the design of new schemes and approaches for university–business interaction need to consider defining their sector priorities and the state of economic transformation. In addition It is recommended that the partners with the inclusion of URBACT Local Support Group members need to be taken to see models of best practice highlighting the new approaches of particular European Universities to university‐business interaction e.g. University of Twente, in the medium‐sized city of Enschede with regard to Spin‐Outs. This should be further supported by the delivery of Run‐UP workshops and seminars that can highlight wider European best practice resulting in the development of a series of themed case books supporting capitalisation at the network and programme level. The RUnUP network has a unique opportunity to explore the role of universities in medium‐sized cities and to develop local actions in 9 cities from 9 member states across the European Union bringing together triple‐helix actors in support of economic and urban development. The results of the network in its implementation phase will provide a clear policy approach for municipalities and local authorities while providing a significant influence to European Policy in support of urban and regional development and its integration with education and research. 
1.0 INTRODUCTION.
The URBACT II programme recognises the urban contribution to growth and jobs and that cities are home to innovation, entrepreneurial spirit and economic growth. Priority axis 1 of the operational programme in particular recognises the important themes of promoting entrepreneurship and improving innovation and the knowledge economy and the development of triple helix structures as catalysts to promote innovation structures and entrepreneurial spirit. The URBACT I‐project STRIKE, within its academic output and strategic documents identified that internationally connected metropolitan areas are the driving force in the global economy and in particular the knowledge economy which they often dominate. Medium sized cities as “Urban Poles” are critical to driving forward EU economic performance and innovation competence within the context of the Lisbon Strategy. The strategic development and exploitation of endogenous potentials is crucial, and universities are critical to this innovation process. A specific issue facing Urban Poles is they cannot make sufficient use of existing knowledge and competencies of their universities to support economic development and encourage entrepreneurship. In support of this the RUnUP network and the engagement of URBACT Local Support Groups (ULSG) in each of the 9 partner cities will address in a uniquely different way the fundamental issues of how universities should engage with their local communities with a particular focus on medium‐sized cities; the role of local authorities and municipalities and the importance of triple helix structures for supporting economic development and encouraging entrepreneurship. RUnUP partners consider this task fundamental in supporting clusters in line with the innovation drive within the Lisbon Strategy. RUnUP aims to support all relevant stakeholders in all areas of urban development to ensure participation, investment and continued movement towards achieving sustainable economic growth in all regions of the European Union. This baseline study is a core output of the RUnUP 6‐month project development phase which has included lead expert visits to all 9 medium‐sized city partners in 9 European Union member states. It provides a basis for the RUnUP phase II application through its review of the state of the art, individual partner profiles, and partner comparison and network synthesis. 
2.0 RUnUP: STATE OF THE ART 
2.1 Introduction.
Since the Lisbon European Union Spring Council of 2000 set a strategic goal for the European Union to become the most dynamic and competitive knowledge based economy in the world by 2010 there has been significant research, policies and projects on how to stimulate the knowledge economy and importantly the role of Universities within Triplex Helix Structures. In this context the Knowledge economy relies on the transfer of knowledge from those who generate it to those who use it and can build on it. Research represents a key component of this approach and the role of universities is particularly important as actors in research, education and training. Universities account for 20% of European Research, 80% of fundamental research and employ one third of European researchers2. They transmit knowledge through education and training and have an increasing role in innovation and economic development at the regional level. In support of this the 2005 Lisbon mid‐term review explicitly highlighted the importance of the role of universities in the creation, dissemination and transfer of knowledge3. In this innovation and economic development role it is recognised that links and synergies between universities and local society (e.g. Industry, Chambers of Commerce, and Local Government) should be enhanced4. Cities are widely recognised as playing a fundamental role in the promotion of the knowledge economy but most research and policy has focussed on large cities with World‐class educational and research institutes and advanced clusters of economic activity. There are clear and significant gaps in the knowledge of how smaller sized cities, with different levels and types of knowledge institutions and different levels of economic activity can compete within the Knowledge Economy. Yet such cities are recognised within European Union policy as playing a vital role in the implementation of the Lisbon agenda. In this regard medium‐sized cities of between 50,000 and 200,000 people with universities are at a considerable advantage and can gain from strong localisation economies if they have a strong knowledge base and innovation culture. The RUnUP network addresses in a uniquely different way the fundamental issues of how universities should engage with their local communities with a particular focus on medium‐sized cities; the role of local authorities and municipalities and the importance of triple helix structures for supporting economic development and encouraging entrepreneurship. To support the network and its partners in beginning to address these issues this review explores the importance of an integrated approach to industrial transformation with the role of universities and economic development partners at a local level in particular utilising a general framework from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) which allows us to understand the specific challenges faced by cities much more clearly while at the same time providing a structure for comparison and the drawing of general policy conclusions. In addition the State of the Art highlights best practice approaches from medium‐sized cities to enhancing knowledge based entrepreneurship and knowledge transfer. In particular the State of the Art highlights the distinctive characteristics of the RUnUP approach; namely: The understanding of the concrete needs of each partner city in relation to its existing economic base and the ‘absorptive capacity’ of its firms, allowing us to map out strategies for the partner cities each with different economic starting positions. The alignment of university activity to economic transformation. Recognising that the traditional linear model of seeing universities as producers of knowledge from research and conversion into technology transfer and developing spin‐outs is extremely limited. Universities can undertake much wider roles in local economies many of which are more aligned to the focus of small and medium‐sized cities. The activities of RUnUP will extend and highlight the range of alternatives regarding the role of Universities in such environments. Focusing on the practical role that local authorities can play in Small and Medium‐Sized Cities as the vital interface between the needs of economic actors and the knowledge base. By studying good practice both within and outside the RUnUP partners the approach will allow the network to provide practical guidelines for city managers while at the same time producing general policy recommendations to strengthen a vital component of the Lisbon Strategy. 
5.0 RUNUP: SYNTHESIS. 
5.1 Introduction.
The RUnUP network addresses the fundamental issues of how universities should engage with their local communities with a particular focus on medium‐sized cities; the role of local authorities and municipalities and the importance of triple helix structures for supporting economic development and encouraging entrepreneurship. To support the network and its partners the synthesis brings together the needs and challenges of the partner cities in a coherent way and within the broader context of the role of universities in Medium Sized cities. 
5.2 RUN‐UP: Adding Value at the City and European Level.
 The Knowledge economy relies on the transfer of knowledge from those who generate it to those who use it and can build on it. For a local economy engagement in knowledge based industries can have a significant impact. As has been outlined in the State of the Art European policy approaches to the knowledge economy for the most part take universities as their point of reference regarding competitive research and their contribution to the European Research Area. In particular the European Commission publication European Universities: Enhancing Europe’s Research Base identifies the entrepreneurial role of universities as a source of spin‐offs and start‐up companies and their role in knowledge and technology transfer. In this context universities are seen as environments that are: The centre of the research and teaching systems; The training institutions for our future researchers; A point where frontier knowledge meets practical applications; The school and library of the knowledge society. In support of this, universities have seen the growth of standard models (e.g. external liaison offices, research and development offices and technology transfer offices) as central mechanisms for linking academia with the economy, with a particular focus on: Contributing to faster and better commercialisation of research results; Improving innovation performance and accelerate the dissemination of new technologies; Better management of intellectual property and research capacities of public research organisations; Identifying specific research requirements through dialogue with enterprises; Helping companies grow and become more competitive. Such support mechanisms designed to raise R&D levels are likely to be most appropriate for and successful in, those economic areas where levels of innovation in product, process and service developments are already high. To support the development of their local economy the partners in the RUnUP network need to examine how knowledge is transferred into the economy. The RUnUP partners operate in urban areas with generally a large number of micro‐sized companies and Small and Medium‐Sized Enterprises. In this context the “absorptive capacity” of companies plays a key role in determining their capability to access and make use of external knowledge in particular through external collaboration with other companies (e.g. Suppliers, Customers, and Partners) or with Universities and Technology Centres. In particular they need to develop with partners from their URBACT Local Support Groups mechanisms that support the capability of companies to acquire knowledge through connections with external organisations (including Universities) in line with the industrial transformation of the economy. The network has taken an integrated approach to economic transformation examining the role of universities and economic development partners at a local level in particular utilising a general framework from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) which has allowed us to understand the specific challenges faced by cities much more clearly while at the same time providing a structure for comparison and the drawing of general policy conclusions. Traditionally medium‐sized urban areas seeking to work with and to integrate universities into their economic activities often take a “classic perspective” of universities focussed solely on technology transfer and spin‐out activity linked to research. The adoption of this integrated approach provides a mechanism through which local authorities can become actively engaged in defining and delivering their local approach to engage business in the knowledge economy and influencing the role of local and regional universities in line with the principle of the triple helix of university‐industry‐government relations. 
5.3 RUNUP: Promoting the Knowledge Economy within the Partner Cities.
 The RUnUP network focuses on the practical role that local authorities can play in Small and Medium‐Sized Cities as the vital interface between the needs of economic actors and the knowledge base. 
5.3.1 Gateshead.
 The challenge for Gateshead in promoting the knowledge economy is that while it has no university located within its metropolitan borough, there is a clear need to work closely with the excellent range of nearby university institutions, and to ensure that their focus is increasingly aligned to the needs of the Gateshead economy. While it operates collaborative activity with its partner universities the council needs to fully understand how its knowledge based partners deliver activity in support of economic transformation so that as a result in can deliver new knowledge‐based collaboration activity in line with economic transformation requirements. In particular it needs to articulate the state of transformation within its local economy, specifically its role within the creative industries and its support for modernisation and diversification of its manufacturing economy. The ULSG for Gateshead for Gateshead has met 2 times during the development phase, including 1 meeting with the lead expert. Its composition is strongly linked to the structure of the triple helix and promotion of the knowledge economy involving stakeholders form Universities (Newcastle and Northumbria), Government (Gateshead Council, Newcastle Council, One North East (Managing Authority) and Business representation (Chamber of Commerce, Engineering Employers Federation). 
5.4 RUNUP: Partner Issues and Challenges.
 The RUnUP State of the Art identified that medium‐sized urban areas often seek to work and integrate universities into their economic activities in line with the principles of the Knowledge Economy but often take a “classical perspective” of universities focused solely on technology transfer and spin‐out activity linked to research. The introduction of a model (see figure 2.5 in the State of the Art) for mapping the transition of local economies with university roles provides a structure for debate between municipalities and universities on how to drive forward and support their local business community in line with the principle of the triple helix of university‐business government relations. Utilising this model as a framework for exploring the future activities of the RUnUP network comparisons can be made (see figure 5.4) between the detailed problematic of each of the partners that will explored. 
i) Creating New Economies. 
The creation of new economies based on Knowledge is a key focus and problematic in all of the partner cities with the exception of Dunkirk and to a lesser extent Leszno. This is not unrealistic as the partners are pro‐active in seeking to develop their economies around higher value adding sectors in line with the principles of the Knowledge Economy. For Águeda the municipality has already identified the importance of establishing a business incubator linked to environmental technologies. Such an activity linked to commercialisation approach of the University of Aveiro and the School of Technology and Management in Águeda is essential to encourage entrepreneurial development among students, graduates, staff and the local community. In Campobasso and Patras there is a particular requirement to define these new sector opportunities in partnership with their local universities however it is considered that opportunities exist in the fields of; sustainable industries and bio‐medical/biotech for Campobasso and Informatics and Communications and Environmental Management and Protection in Patras. Similarly, Barakaldo needs to define its sector focus but is clear in its aim in developing a joint local initiative that links research into the generation of spin‐out companies and entrepreneurial activity, enhancing linkages with local business. In comparison, Gateshead Council is already examining the potential for the creation of new economic activity around the cultural and creative sector, possibly focusing on a design led economy linked to the Design Centre for the North, although the viability and impact of such a focus must be examined. In Potsdam the University needs to articulate a strategy for enhancing its awareness of structures and processes for increasing its commercialisation activities and how these can align, integrate and mutually support the education and research activities of the university. Additionally in implementing a strategy for knowledge based transformation the university needs to encourage and develop business development skills and capabilities within their university staff to support longer term strategy implementation. For Solna the situation can be more precisely defined. With the world‐class Karolinska Institute located in their municipality and existing activity already in place to support the establishment of Bio‐Tech and Life Science companies through KI Science Park and KI Innovations the focus of their engagement in the RUnUP network is specifically around supporting an additional‐tier of spin‐out companies through incubation and improvements to the referral process for potential spin‐out and licensing opportunities alongside the establishment of stronger relationships between the Municipality of Solna and the Karolinska Institute. 
ii) New Industry Transplantation. 
While new industry transplantation can be seen traditionally and more extensively in the lower wage economies of the European Union this element of University interaction with the economy has not been identified as a problematic by the RUnUP Partners. While Leszno with a focus on the development of Special Economic Zones has a potential interest in this area its main focus is seen as the modernisation of its existing industry in the design and manufacture of products and secondly in the development of incubation activity in support of the development of new economic sectors.
iii) Diversification of the Economy.
Economic Diversification is seen as the key problematic in relation to Dunkirk where the university contribution to the economy is seen as insufficient and the linkage of the local economy to the energy sector makes the future particularly uncertain given the current global climate. The focus in this case is on the diversification of companies into new knowledge economy areas linked to the environmental sector and sustainability with particular links to the environmental research centre and developing entrepreneurial support services of the university. In addition diversification within the manufacturing sector of Águeda is a priority as with nearly 50% of employment within manufacturing and the increasing pressures of globalisation in their traditional product markets they are seeking to move into environmental technology related economic activity areas. Diversification is also a related activity to modernisation. In this context this is a secondary priority for Gateshead, Patras and Campobasso. v) Upgrading of Mature Economies. Modernisation of industry is a primary goal of Leszno, whose economy is based on traditional industries with low levels of productivity. In delivering innovation led growth for Leszno through the modernisation of its existing economic base and the creation of new companies a new relationship between the municipality and business support organisations in Leszno needs to be established. Similarly manufacturing remains a significant part of the Gateshead economy and there is a particular requirement to develop a strategy that supports the modernisation of its existing manufacturing and an upgrading of its skills base. The challenge facing Campobasso within this context is that its existing economic structure is dominated by the agriculture sector. The Scientific & Technological Park of Molise (Molise Innovazione) is supporting businesses operating in this sector but is limited in its current level of engagement and support for businesses. Its operations and approach to working with business need to be further developed and enhanced. Importantly, it is recommended that several of the RUnUP partners namely Patras, Campobasso, Barakaldo, Gateshead and Leszno as has been highlighted within individual baseline reports need to further explore and define the sector development approach that will be pursued within their economies. Such strategies need to be articulated before a proactive approach to university engagement in the local economy can be successfully implemented. Such a requirement is not unrealistic or uncommon for medium sized cities as this particular issue has been highlighted in policy documents that have been reviewed within the State of the Art report. 
5.5 Concluding Remarks.
 The URBACT II RUnUP network provides a unique opportunity to examine the role of universities in urban poles from the perspective of Local Government, given the constitution of the partners rather than a traditional model taking Universities as the point of reference. In the development phase this unique perspective has provided valuable insights; namely: Universities are positioned as mechanisms for research and development and subsequently licensing, patenting and spin‐outs (and this is reinforced in European and National policies); although this may not be where their potential for supporting local economic development truly exists. Local Government organisations see Universities primarily as vehicles for Education and Research & Development (see point 1) and expect them to support the development of their local economy by default although universities operate in regional, national and international markets and are not entirely (if at all) aligned to local priorities. An economic development perspective examining the needs of the local economy, its modernisation, transformation, transplantation and new sector creation establishes common ground where local priorities can be articulated and the role of the university in this context can be openly explored and suitable knowledge transfer approaches defined in support of triple‐helix development. Moving forward at a local level it is recommended that the partners in the RUnUP network need to enhance their individual and organisational knowledge of their local and regional knowledge based institutions. Only by understanding the structures, key contacts, key research and educational themes and existing approaches of universities to working with their local economy can they support the development of triple‐helix structures and the alignment of university activity to local economic development priorities. In parallel with this the partners as a prerequisite to the design of new schemes and approaches for university–business interaction need to consider defining their sector priorities and the state of economic transformation. The RUnUP partners have a limited perspective (normally of their own universities) of the capability of Universities to support economic development. It is recommended that the partners with the inclusion of URBACT Local Support Group Members need to be taken to see models of best practice highlighting the new approaches of certain European Universities to university‐business interaction e.g. University of Twente, in the medium‐sized city of Enschede with regard to Spin‐Outs. This should be further supported by the delivery of Run‐UP workshops and seminars that can highlight wider European best practice resulting in the development of a series of themed case books supporting capitalisation at the network and programme level. Similarly in support of the capitalisation process it is recommended that the knowledge obtained through the work of the network should be developed into a Continuing Professional Development course for both Local Government and University staff to highlight the significant potential of modern universities in supporting innovation in their local economy and the mechanisms by which a transformation in medium sized cities to the knowledge economy can be delivered. As a result of this the distinctive characteristics of the RUnUP approach can be summarised as: The understanding of the concrete needs of each partner city in relation to its existing economic base and the ‘absorptive capacity’ of its firms, allowing us to map out strategies for the partner cities each with different economic starting positions. The alignment of university activity to economic transformation. Recognising that the traditional linear model of seeing universities as producers of knowledge from research and conversion into technology transfer and developing spin‐outs is extremely limited. Universities can undertake much wider roles in local economies many of which are more aligned to the focus of small and medium‐sized cities. The activities of RUnUP will extend and highlight the range of alternatives regarding the role of Universities in such environments. A focus on the practical role that local authorities can play in Small and Medium‐Sized Cities as the vital interface between the needs of economic actors and the knowledge base. By studying good practice both within and outside the RUnUP partners the approach will allow the network to provide practical guidelines for city managers while at the same time producing general policy recommendations to strengthen a vital component of the Lisbon Strategy.

Local Impacts from Smart City Planning.
Abstract
Since 2010 “Smart Cities” have been increasingly subject to scientific and political debate, leading to an uptake of the smart city concept into wider funding of innovation-oriented urban development programmes at national or EU level. Whilst the larger EU and other nationally led Smart Cities programmes are putting a strong emphasis on technology-based and data-driven development of smart district demonstrators, little emphasis is put on governance structures, processes, business model innovation and integrated action planning to support the actual delivery of results. This article gives an overview of the development of the smart city concept in Europe, discusses different drivers and potentially conflicting interests and points towards the concept of living labs and innovation districts as fruitful testbeds for smart cities. The article argues that although implementing early pilot projects and demonstrators, crucial knowledge is lacking at EU level on how to streamline smart solutions into the core-business of urban governance and development. It is further argued that harnessing the full potential of the smart city as a model for sustainable urban growth will require a paradigm shift within public-private collaborations. Our current models of designing, building, financing and operating the city need to be rethought and updated. The article suggests focusing on three core areas of learning that help bring about the transition to a smart city mainstream model: the municipal role in smart city business models and replication, the integrator within the municipality and the systems integrator of smart districts and its role. 
Smart Cities in Europe.
 Since the 1980’s regional and local policymakers throughout Europe have been propagating different approaches to develop cities that are liveable, economically successful and increasingly sustainable. Throughout this quest for “the city of the future” various paradigms hit the urban developers and policy makers like high-frequency Konratieff waves. In the 1990s it was the bottom-up movements of the Local Agenda 21 who tried to push for a more inclusive and sustainable development of cities. Many city authorities incorporated their ideas and shifted the focus to climate change mitigation and sustainable development goals over the years 2000 -10. Integrated urban development plans based on the Leipzig Charter and a large set of city-oriented action-networks addressing all sorts of urban challenges were the results of this development. Polis, Eurocities, Energy cities or the URBACT city networks are strong and successful examples of this city-induced push for a more sustainable way of developing cities though integrated policies and sustainable action plans. Around the year 2010 an important paradigm-shift has taken place in the mind-set of city managers, policy makers and industry leaders. Cities realized that building sustainable systems needs to include industry and technology providers to a far greater extent than originally thought. At the same time, the digital revolution made it actually possible to maximize efficiency of urban systems by linking clean technologies, infrastructures, city operators and citizens through smart devices and intelligent services. Businesses identified cities and urban environments as massive new markets and started to introduce apparently tailor-made solutions for the connected and digital city. Data-driven processes are now improving our urban mobility systems and increasingly decentralized energy flows. They help city authorities to take better decisions, save money and have the potential to connect to their communities on a real-time basis. Taken together, this shift of paradigm is the smart city! Smart cities represent the culmination of a development that is now bringing together local green grass-root movements and Silicon Valley mind-sets. Smart cities promise us: we can build clean, efficient, sustainable and highly attractive cities by at the same time increase economic development. Policy makers across Europe hope that smart cities are the key to bridging the gap between social and ecological sustainability and economic growth. This is the reason why European policy makers today are putting a strong emphasis on the development of smart cities and communities: European Institutions like the European Commission (EC) or the European Investment Bank (EIB) but also national governments increasingly recognize smart cities as key element to achieving the highly ambitious development goals of the EU. With the “European Strategy for Smart, Sustainable and Inclusive Growth” the EU confirmed the 20 x 20 x 20 goals in 2010 and put emphasis on innovation, R&D and the digital economy (European Commission 2010). In its 2050 roadmap, the EC is looking beyond the 2020 objectives and sets out a plan to meet the long-term target of reducing domestic emissions by 80 to 95% by mid-century. Large potentials for reaching this target are seen within urban transport, buildings and energy systems and their respective technology transition (European Commission 08.03.2011). In its White Paper on Transport the EC sets out the goal to have no more conventionally-fuelled cars in cities by 2050 (European Commission 2011) and in October 2014 the European Council concluded on the 2030 Climate and Energy Policy Framework, which sets a binding target of 40% domestic reduction in GHG emissions and at share of renewable energies of at least 27% by 2030 (European Council 2014). At the same time, the EC has identified the completion of the Digital Single Market (DSM) as one of its 10 political priorities and is prospecting to invest 21.4 billion EUR into the digital economy – with cities and urban infrastructures being the key addressees for these investments (European Commission 2015). Taken together, the ICT and sustainability policies of the EC are set to reinforce each other and to culminate in Smart Cities as key areas of growth, markets and investments. Leading heads of the European Investment Bank and attached research institutions are starting to look towards smart cities as instruments for place based investments that would serve to master the transition towards regional specialization and economic prosperity of heterogeneous regions – especially in the less developed parts of Europe (Leanza und Carbonaro 2015). There is, however, no consensus on what a smart city actually is. The terminology has become a handy vessel that can be filled with whatever the personal perception of a smart city is. For Vienna – one of the early birds to jump on the smart city train – the Smart City represents the overarching framework for an innovation-driven, resource efficient and liveable city that includes an innovation strategy as well as a sustainability strategy (City of Vienna 2014). For IBM or Cisco (to name just two examples from the corporate world) the Smart City is the perfect playground for the internet of everything: „The smart city market is as an amalgam of several existing markets, as well as a driver for emerging technologies and solutions that span existing sectors“ especially „smart energy, smart water, smart buildings, smart transportation, and smart government“ (Woods und Goldstein 2014). According to Navigant Research estimates, the global smart city technology market is expected to be worth more than $27.5 billion annually by 2023, compared to $8.8 billion in 2014 (Ibid.). Although the concept of smart cities has emerged from tech-driven ideas about urban utopias and the perfect place of modernity, it now differs from these urban visions in some important ways. From the idea of creating the ideal place for innovating and developing new technologies (Silicon Valley), smart cities have become the target of the application of new technologies. Although saturated as consumer markets, cities present opportunities for firms seeking markets for modern sensing, forecasting and management technologies. Although 1990s city policymakers sought to replicate the job base and innovative milieu of high-tech centres, the contemporary purveyors of smart city technologies see city governments as markets for the products of the last 40 years of technology development. At the same time, ambitious politicians and civil servants are ever on the search for the next ‘big idea’ to move their city to the top of the rank of attractive places. The race to get on the bandwagon and become a smart city has encouraged city policymakers to embrace and embed the process of technology-led growth, directing municipal budgets toward investments that bestow smart city status (Glasmeier und Christopherson 2015 ). These reinforcing factors result in a joint interest of industry and city authorities to deliver on smart cities, smart districts and smart services for their citizens and customers; yet – when taking a closer look – they reveal some aspects of the challenges that city managers and local governments face in the smart city debate: delivering competitive local innovation ecosystems and providing healthy and sustainable communities for their citizens and future generations, by entering into new cooperations with industry and resisting the strong business push to sell poorly adapted urban technologies at the same time. On European level the Innovation Partnership on Smart Cities and Communities (EIP) is the most important stakeholder platform for co-creating smart cities and corresponding solutions and processes. It is a large and lose network of over 4.000 representatives of cities, industry, research, politics and multiplier institutions, which is trying to fill the Smart City Agenda with life. 370 commitments of mixed consortia and six action clusters are working towards a transition pathway that would help the European Smart City Community deliver on the promises of Smart Cities for Europe. Although run and supported by the EC, the EIP is a self-organizing network, which is hard to programme. Thus, it represents an excellent body for discussion and networking, but it is not expected to deliver a consistent and comprehensive Smart City Agenda for Europe. The most important achievement of the EIP so far, was to publish a Smart City Implementation Plan (European Innovation Partnership on Smart Cities and Communities 2013), which became the core strategic document underlying EU-driven Smart Cities initiatives. It defines 11 priority areas with three vertical areas (Sustainable Urban Mobility, Sustainable Districts and Integrated Infrastructures and processes across Energy, ICT and Transport) and eight key horizontal enablers on the themes of Decisions, Insight, and Financing. Together with the Operational Implementation Plan (European Innovation Partnership on Smart Cities and Communities 2014), this document represented the background for a large EU funding programme on Smart Cities and Communities within the research and innovation framework Horizon 2020. In the work programme 2014 / 2015 over 210 Million € were dedicated as grants to large first of- its-kind demonstration projects for smart districts in European lighthouse cities (SCC1 projects). Mixed consortia of cities, research and industry were able to apply for funding in order to create smart lighthouse districts that would actually show urban Europe how to develop and deliver smart cities. While 19 consortia with ca. 120 cities applied in 2014, it was already 43 consortia with more than 250 cities that submitted an application to the EC in 2015. These figures alone show an impressive size of an accelerating movement amongst European cities and businesses towards creating smart districts and delivering on the promises of smart cities for citizens, communities and local economies. Today (November 2015) three large smart city lighthouse projects funded through the EC are up and running: Triangulum with Manchester, Eindhoven and Stavanger as Lighthouse cities and Prague, Sabadell and Leipzig as followers. Grow Smarter with Stockholm, Cologne and Barcelona as Lighthouse cities and Valetta, Suceava, Porto, Cork and Graz as followers. Remourban with Valladolid, Nothingham and Tepebasi as Lighthouse Cities and Seraing and Miskolc as followers. Moreover, additional 4-5 lighthouse projects will be announced shortly and several dozens of new consortia are putting together their applications for the SCC1 call in 2016 and 2017. Therefore, this initiative by the EU is arguably the strongest driver of smart cities in Europe today. Whilst the EU Smart Cities Initiative is putting strong emphasis on technology-based and data-driven development of smart district demonstrators, little emphasis is put on governance structures, processes, business model innovation and integrated action planning to support the actual delivery of results. The considerable amount of public funding for implementing tech-based urban innovations has led to a hectic development of smart city implementation plans across Europe’s cities, but this really needs to be thought of as an initial impulse for developing integrated urban development strategies based on sustainable technologies and intelligent solutions, and not as a milestone within a paradigm-shift towards smart cities. Many cities have responded to the EU call on smart cities and communities by quickly putting together smart city strategies in order to comply with the requirements for application. The strategy papers that have been developed and politically enacted in this process are – without naming any specific city – not living up at all to the full potential of smart cities for Europe. They often refer to a set of desired sustainability measures that are linked into an ICT backbone and supported by an existing (often inadequate and inefficient) governance structure. As beneficial as the EU funding is for the smart city, it has also misguided our focus to over-estimate the actual problem-solving capacity of smart cities and underestimate the complexity and required organizational shift that is needed to make smart cities happen. In addition we tend to neglect potential short-comings of the merely techdriven smart cities concept. As Glasmeier writes: many authors […] “agree that smart city technologies are ill-suited to solving the problems that lie at the heart of improving the quality of urban life. Poverty is not on the agenda of smart city planners. They may solve traffic problems, but it is not clear how they will regenerate failing schools or find ways to include neighbourhoods facing disinvestment. The contradiction between the promise of smart cities and its limited policy scope is aptly demonstrated in one of the most celebrated smart cities, Rio de Janeiro. The city, with its control centre filled with wall size computer monitors, can perhaps use forecasts of threatening weather to send out warnings of storm intensity thus leading to speedier evacuation. What it does not address is the question of why people build housing in such high-risk environments and what it would take to change this behaviour. In this instance, at least, smart city technologies deal with symptoms rather than the disease” (Glasmeier und Christopherson 2015). Our task today, as city managers in Europe, is to fill the smart city vessel with life and to define the European pathway to Smart Cities. We therefore need to acquire sovereignty of definition about the goals and purposes that have us investing into smart cities, as well as about the potentials that the interconnection of new technologies, infrastructures, citizens and local governments actually bear for our communities. Therefore we need to augment the tech- and business driven smart city concept with governance models, investment frameworks and new forms of public-private collaboration. We need to look towards well-developed frameworks like the triple (or quadruple) helix (like for example Eindhoven is doing), the sustainability cycle or sustainability management tools (like Stockholm is applying) or energy planning approaches (like Gothenburg is using) and many other functioning instruments that will helps us capitalize on the Smart City in a way that means real added value for our citizens, local economies and the environment. It makes sense to take a look towards national initiatives on smart and sustainable cities for shaping the European Smart city in a good way. In Germany, a large stakeholder forum (Nationale Plattform Zukunftsstadt) has released a systems research agenda in February 2015 to transform cities towards becoming CO2 neural, energy and resource-efficient and climate-adapted (Nationale Plattform Zukunftsstadt 2015). Lead by four ministries, this platform is being transformed into an “Implementation Platform” to initiate, oversee and monitor innovation-oriented projects on future cities that aim at delivering the tools, processes and best practices for cross-sector and crossstakeholder collaboration on sustainable cities. In addition, the Morgenstadt Initiative is running a European network of leading cities, companies and research institutes that aims at developing and implementing socio-technical innovations for the city of the future and is using a City lab approach to develop individual action roadmaps for cities like Prague, Lisbon, Chemnitz or Berlin. To ensure that the UK can make the most of opportunities relating to smart cities, in 2013 the Government established the Smart Cities Forum to bring together cities, industry, sector experts and government departments to identify and address any barriers to development and deployment. With the Future Cities Catapult, the UK has created a global centre of excellence on urban innovations and is investing heavily into applied research and innovation around future cities. The core focus is on promoting healthy cities, building resilience in urban infrastructure, and designing strategies to help cities adopt and finance smarter technologies. Since 2013 the French Government has been investing over 2 bn Euro into Smart City activities in France, lead by the Ministry of sustainable development. In addition, the research and innovation network advancity is channelling urban innovation between the research and industry and has examined over 450 projects of which more than 158 have received financing, representing a total investment of €460 million in research and innovation for smart cities. Thus, there are numerous initiatives at national level that future smart cities can attach to. These initiatives, however, approach a sustainable urban development from different backgrounds and thus shade different perspectives on smart cities. A first comparative analysis of Smart Cities in Europe comes to conclude that “…Virtually all cities with a population of over 100,000 in Nordic Member States can be characterised as Smart Cities, as can the majority of cities in Italy, Austria and the Netherlands and approximately half of British, Spanish and French cities. Germany and Poland have relatively few Smart Cities. Eastern European countries generally have a lower incidence of Smart Cities than the rest of EU-28“ (DIRECTORATE GENERAL FOR INTERNAL POLICIES 2014). 
Smart Districts as key to smart cities.
 In today’s knowledge-based economy, marked by both unprecedented technological advancement and vigorous competition, the role of innovation is indispensable and cities as forerunners of innovation are of exceptional importance. Dense urban fabric with its high concentration of advanced infrastructure, qualified workforce and advanced commerce furthers interdisciplinary exchange, emergence of social networks, and establishment of new businesses, and thus provides the necessary foundation for unconventional thinking and disruptive innovation. The spatial geography of innovation is now undergoing a major change: as the world is growing increasingly more complex, technology is advancing at an immense pace. The great findings that once were made by single gifted researchers scattered around the globe, in their homes or garages, in the future will more likely be done by teams of experts working in collaboration. A trend of co-working spaces is becoming increasingly more popular: in collaborative spaces, scientists can exchange ideas with each other and have efficient access to everything from legal advice to state-of-the art lab equipment. In the 20th century the landscape of innovation was defined by several large-scale science parks in regions like Silicon Valley in the USA or Sophia Antipolis in France. However, the time of vast, spatially isolated corporate campuses, not accessible by any other means of transportation than a car has now passed. In the 21st century, a new and promising trend is emerging, namely an innovation district, which is a product of the current economic, cultural, and demographic forces that are reshaping the contemporary lifestyle. In contrast to the aforementioned large science parks, smart districts are compact geographical areas within cities, which provide businesses, start-ups, research, educational and cultural institutions with space to form a tight-knit collaborative cluster built on the basis of cutting-edge technology. Physical proximity, ensured mobility and encouraged sense of community help entrepreneurs, scientists and students to work together, share ideas and technologies to promote „open innovation“. Networking is the key asset, replacing previous economic models of dispersed industries, sectors and specializations. Innovation districts pave the way for new transformative collaborations and creations by people and companies who might have never found common ground before, now see no obstacles for joint creative development via the convergence of disparate sectors and specializations. This dynamic physical realm, densely informed with innovative ideas inevitably causes knowledge spill overs and acts as a catalyst for economic development in the region. Innovation districts make it easier to overcome bureaucratic gaps which slow down new projects, and hinder new businesses such as finding financial and legal aid for start-ups. This new model brings much-needed change to the way we have become accustomed to view urban social and economic development. The fundamental element of any city are the people that inhabit it – and people are looking for places where work, education, culture and social interaction are linked together by easily accessible means. The contemporary knowledge-based economy is hugely defined by the needs of Generation Y: for them work ceases to be in the first place a means of material support, rather they attach great value to deriving pleasure from their work, to realizing their personal ambitions and aspirations, to inspiring workplace environment, as well as to the exchange of ideas. Innovation districts provide their citizens not only with open and creative working spaces, but also with suitable residential facilities if required. These modern enclaves follow the principles of sustainability when it comes to environment: intelligent energy management helps foster environmentally friendly and cost-effective energy use, while e-mobility and bicycle routes solve environmental problems caused by traffic and allow for a more effective time use. Living conditions offer a mix of options including affordable housing and efficient infrastructure, thus local residents are focused on achievements and progress, rather than on rent and living costs. New talents will inevitably be attracted by open, clean and functional working and living spaces, giving blood flow to the whole body of the city. The establishment of such innovation hubs is essential for successful economic development in the 21st century. Existing resources must be used in the smartest way possible, offering effective solutions to socio-economic problems caused by recent financial crises. One of the most prominent among these problems is unemployment: many people, including aspiring scientists and entrepreneurs, have lost jobs. The development of Smart Districts entails rapid job creation. Convergence economy with lowered external costs fosters dynamic business development and expansion, creating an extensive amount of high-quality jobs. Furthermore, smart districts offer numerous educational opportunities for all socio-economic backgrounds, making them skilled competitors on the job market. In strict fiscal terms, innovation districts are beneficial for municipal governments as they help increase the tax revenue by the commercialization of ideas that leads to the creation and expansion of firms and jobs via proximity and collaboration. Increased tax revenue may be used for better municipal development ensuring successful functioning of a lucrative self-sufficient economic model. This accounts not only for the innovative neighbourhood itself: the spill over effects are likely to improve the economic standing of the whole city and region. The potential benefits of smart districts for local communities go hand-in-hand with a new approach to innovations of complex systems, which has started to increasingly gain traction among business innovators, open-innovation communities and even large-scale infrastructure developers: the idea of Living Labs. As we have seen, creating a smart city is a highly complex undertaking and needs to build on innovative technologies as well as on innovative planning processes and new stakeholder constellations. Political, spatial, economic, environmental, social etc. parameters need to be taken into account. Complexity science and transition management tell us that a successful form of creating complex systems is to start with small experiments and start scaling up from there. „The premise of the Living Lab is that the city can be used as a real-world testing ground for new ideas and technologies. A vast array of sensors in the urban realm can facilitate the testing of products and services on a real world platform, Schumacher and Feurstein define it as a research methodology for sensing, validating and refining complex solutions in multiple and evolving real life contexts.“ (Cosgrave et al. 2013, S. 671) Smart districts that serve as living labs for socio-technical interactions bare the potential to show us the way to the city of the future. City districts provide the right scale for technologies and other system interventions that are neither too small to suffer from cost-effectiveness issues nor too large to suffer from planning and invasiveness issues. They provide well-bounded spaces to undertake radical change and evaluate the impacts of that change. Smart districts combine the orientation towards a research-oriented knowledge-economy of innovation districts and the experimental character of living labs. Smart districts are thus in essence the places where the social, economic and technological model for the city of the future can be designed, tested and improved in new forms of collaboration between city administrations, businesses, citizens and research. Taken together, smart districts are the incubators of the smart city. Already today there are numerous good examples from districts across Europe and worldwide where an innovation-oriented economy meets conditions for experimenting with new urban technologies in a real-life environment. The proceeding graph gives an overview over existing best practices of smart districts across the world. Some of them have already been realized, others are still within a planning stage. The key challenge in creating smart districts is to align four core levels of district development in innovative project consortia: The technology and infrastructure level, the socio-economic strategy level, the governance and management level and the availability of finance. It has been noticed before that especially in smart districts a range of elements converge that make project development and implementation with conventional approaches difficult – and often impossible. These are not only conflicting goals between various stakeholders, more than this the challenge lies in providing new value added services to citizens in a stable and reliable manner, when the best environment for developing and testing new products and services is characterized through low degrees of formalization and less-binding mechanisms of accountability (Concilio und Molinari 2015). Chapter 3 deals in more detail with the different kinds of risks and barriers that hinder the development of smart districts today. This general challenge of conflicting goals and badly matching requirements at the level of different stakeholders, results in a set of risks and barriers that make it difficult to plan, develop and deliver smart districts through a well-formed and commonly agreed upon approach. Up until now, there is no blueprint for developing smart districts. This is the reason, why creating smart districts has been recognized as one key area of public funding by the EU Commission, which is supporting the development of European Lighthouse districts in ca. 20 – 30 cities across Europe with ca. 400 Millions EUR through Horizon 2020 between 2014 and 2017. Cities like Manchester, Eindhoven, Stavanger, Stockholm, Barcelona, Cologne etc. have been selected throughout H2020 as SCC1 lighthouse cities and have received substantial funding to implement a set of highly innovative technologies and socio-technical systems for the development of smart districts. Yet, as indicated above, this funding is at risk not leverage the full potential of smart districts, because the paradigm shift in urban governance, urban financing, urban business innovation etc. has not been addressed adequately by accompanying measures at EU level. The H2020 Lighthouse cities are thus not only the testbeds for smart districts; they are also the guinea-pigs to discover, test and improve a new governance and business innovation approach to urban development. 
Introducing SmartImpact. 
The URBACT III Network SmartImpact aims to develop organisational and knowledge-based instruments that help its member cities to deliver on the promise of the “smart city”. SmartImpact cities share three important goals: - They want to grow their economy in a sustainable way. - The want to reduce their environmental footprint. - They want to increase the efficiency of public spending. SmartImpact city members are convinced that a “smart approach” based on ICT, data management and collaboration, allows them to pursue all three of these goals at the same time. Most of SmartImpact partners have already successfully experimented with pilot projects in the area of energy, transport, Open Data or sustainable buildings. Others are about to roll out smart city pilot projects or need to steer the development of a new district in a sustainable and intelligent way. However, all cities face the challenge to mainstream investments and maintenance of “smart solutions” and “smart processes” into their everyday business of city planning, urban development, infrastructure management, city maintenance and economic development. Smart solutions are integrated socio-technical systems that link clean technologies through data and that integrate users and individual behaviour in the form of a wider service and business model. Smart processes are sequences of connected activities bf multiple actors in different municipal departments and other institutions that aim to deliver an urban service in the most efficient and sustainable manner. For SmartImpact cities, becoming “smart” thus means to put an innovation-based management approach to work within the public administration and at the leadership level of the city. This approach will serve to facilitate cross-departmental collaboration and investments, to organise collaboration with the private sector and to spur a maximum uptake of data-driven and ICT-based solutions to deliver public services in an efficient way. Current research funding has been channelled into the development and deployment of smart solutions in pilot projects like those under the H2020 Lighthouse Programmes. The management and governance processes and the new forms of public-private collaboration that are necessary to actually invest into and maintain complex solutions that are based on data and technologies, have not been given adequate attention. Yet, they are the precondition for successfully capitalising on the potential of clean technologies and data-based services. Therefore SmartImpact will explore and develop the Innovation-Management tools for municipalities, which are necessary to finance, build, manage and operate a smart city. SmartImpact members will develop approaches that support decision making, investments, management and maintenance of those smart solutions that help achieving the city’s development goals. The member cities of SmartImpact will focus on the development of processes, organisational structures, programmes and communication-based instruments that help them use “smart solutions” and “smart processes” in the everyday business within departments of the city administration. They will further develop, test and improve approaches that maximise the integration of citizens and the private sector into an innovation-based delivery of public services wherever possible. The goal is to achieve strong impacts on the development goals of member cities on a long-term perspective through mainstreaming connected solutions and ICT-based processes into the daily business of key areas of city planning and development. SmartImpact cities are highly diverse in terms of experience and potential with regards to becoming a smart city and in terms of development challenges that they currently face. The Baseline assessment of all 10 SmartImpact member cities, combined with in-depth research on smart cities and sustainable urban development through Fraunhofer IAO, allows formulating a simple Smart City Maturity Model that allocates advances towards becoming a smart city along the axis of innovation and organisational development.  
SmartImpact Themes. 
Throughout the baseline study it became apparent that SmartImpact partners bring together significant experience in aspirations and the deployment of smart technologies. The partnership is able to demonstrate significant breadth and depth in the field of smart. The baseline studies reveal that whilst there are common opportunities, there are also common challenges. Virtually no partner has already mainstreamed connected solutions and ICT-based processes into the daily business of key areas of city planning and development. The below described five key thematic areas represent the main learning needs of all partners of SmartImpact, which will serve to push all cities more to the upper right corner of the diagram in figure 5. 
1. Organisational Development within the city administration. 
Clean and connected technologies help improve urban services and meet sustainability goals. However, they need to be planned, financed, built and operated across various departments and offices within the city administration. At the same time, becoming smart means to engage civil society, local SME’s, research and larger companies into the process of urban innovation. This again requires a sound top-level organisation, strategy based decision making and the management and monitoring of a complex system – often in an iterative approach. None of the SmartImpact member cities have yet adapted their organisations to the new demands that working with smart solutions impose on them. In no member city is there established administration structures that serve to strategically leverage the potential of smart technologies or to actively shape urban development projects in order to create “smart districts” as a standard process. No member city has yet installed comprehensive processes that help to deal with procuring cross-cutting and data-based technologies or delivery of ICT-based services. And no city has yet found the magic formula to induce enthusiasm for smart solutions and their potential to radically improve processes across a broad section of and commitment to workers -those who maintain the roads, fixes the pipes or tends the green spaces. Yet, SmartImpact member cities have started to think about and experiment with organisational structures and processes that better support a strategic development of a smart city or smart districts. Also, member cities have started to identify processes and structures that serve to integrate multiple stakeholders (public / private) into complex tech-based urban development projects by assuring accountability and efficient planning and decision making. SmartImpact members will therefore work towards organisational innovations that are able to respond to the new challenges of smart cities. 
2. Financing and procurement of innovative & connected solutions. 
Smart Solutions offer cities a range of options to improve services and generate efficiencies. Intelligent lighting can serve to improve parking, enhance security, collect sensor-based city data and save energy at the same time. A hybrid energy grid that uses electric vehicles as storage devices for renewable energies, can drastically increase utilisation levels of renewable energies and reduce emissions of houses, offices and industrial facilities. Financing these “smart solutions” require new ways of understanding how value is created in smart cities, which ultimately leads to co-investment strategies with costs and benefits for public and private actors. On a very practical level, the procurement of smart solutions through a single actor (city) is already challenging, since it requires linking planning processes and budgets of different city departments into one procurement process, and it requires cities to adopt a new innovation-based approach to procurement based on competitive dialogue, innovation partnerships or green procurement. Some SmartImpact member cities are successfully experimenting with innovation-based procurement (e.g. Dublin) and Green procurement (e.g. Stockholm), some are also testing public-private co-investment strategies into smart technologies (Eindhoven), yet these approaches are still at an early stage and need further verification and refinement. Together SmartImpact members will identify value cases for smart solutions and further corresponding investment strategies, and they will develop strategies and approaches to improve the procurement processes of smart solutions within city administrations. 
3. Activating the local Innovation-ecosystem for smart districts. 
At the core of the “smart city” there is innovation. Start-ups, local SMEs, Universities and think tanks are the key players to deliver on the promise of an efficient, clean and liveable city. By integrating citizens into a continuous process of engagement and communication, urban services can become much more adapted to the needs of service users (citizens) and service deliverers (the municipality) and behavioural change can be induced on both levels. But how do cities engage their citizens? How do cities innovate and change behaviours within their organisations? How do they make sure the high-potential start-up knows about the open-data platform and the options to use urban sensor data? How do they communicate their strategies and challenges? How do they make sure that investment decisions actually reflect the strongest demands of citizens? And how do they keep the communication process alive and positive, even if results will not be visible until 2021? Together SmartImpact member cities will develop tools and processes to facilitate communication with SME’s, Universities and citizens. They will learn from each other which approaches to involving private stakeholders into the development process of the smart city have been successfully tested, and which ones did not work so well. 
4. Supportive Regulations & Incentives. 
As described in the State-of-the art document to SmartImpact, there are various barriers that prevent investments into smart solutions from taking off. Local regulations and incentives can play an important role in overcoming some of the described barriers. They can help to channel private investments into integrated technology-based solutions and ICT-based services that support sustainable development of the city. Free parking for electric vehicles, environmental zones and congestion charges, building regulations, compulsory connection to the grid, the use of open data standards, predefined Annual Performance Indicators ; and mandatory data integration are examples for city-based governance instruments that support the uptake of smart solutions. SmartImpact city members will collaborate to identify regulations & incentives in the areas of transport, housing / buildings, energy and ICT that support the uptake of clean technologies and data-based solutions and / or shift behaviour towards more sustainable patterns. They will share best practices to leveraging private investments into smart and sustainable solutions in order to achieve substantial long-term benefits for the city. 
5. Data Integration & E-Government. 
Urban data platforms have the potential to integrate several kinds of urban data-sets for enhancing the delivery of urban services and improve the efficiency of the city administration. Information about waste processes, street lighting, parking spaces, urban delivery services, available renewable energies and much more can be provided in real-time and within a single data platform. Integrating different kinds of data-sets through intelligent algorithms allows for developing new services and for drastically improving urban processes. The prerequisite for this is an open ICT-platform that collects data-sets from different municipal companies and service providers. City administrations are thus required to plan, deploy and operate data platforms and the management of third-party provision of data and delivery of services based on urban data. This imposes several challenges on city administrations – from escaping the lock-in of large corporate platform-providers to contractual negotiations with second-tier service providers who need to comply with open standards and make use of the data for providing and improving smart services. In addition, urban data platforms bear the potential to shifting administrative services to the internet and improving e-government processes based on a better integration of data and users. SmartImpact member cities are in different stages of developing and implementing urban data platforms and e-government services. While some have already successfully deployed a platform solution, others are merely starting the process to identify potential data-sets. Learning about best practices, available solutions and best-in-class approached to manage urban data integration will help SmartImpact cities to advance in their quest for better services and higher efficiency.

"sub>urban.
Reinventing the post-war urban fringe to achieve sustainable densification.


‘Sub>urban. Reinventing the fringe’ is about countering urban sprawl by transforming the complex periphery of cities into a more attractive and high-quality area for existing and future communities. Through a flexible process and an implementation-oriented approach, we seek to reinvent urban planning to achieve this goal. 
Cities in our sub>urban (pronounced urban suburban) network are looking at sustainable urban regeneration of existing urban areas as opposed to further expansion. This process of urban regeneration is not taking place within the inner cities but in the 20th-century post-war urban fringe. The urban fringe area is the zone between high density urban and low density suburban areas, where development pressure is often intense. These areas are less saturated and much more fragmented and patchwork-like than the historic city centres. The cities in our network want to revive these areas and create a newer, high-quality urban environment. Overall, the objective is to intensify the use of underused and poorly used space, increase the quality and availability of housing and amenities, find effective and transparent ways to deal with private and fragmented ownership, improve the connectivity of these areas and rethink the identity of the urban fringe. Since these fringe areas and their restrictions are very different from the inner city and the suburbs, an entirely new approach toward urban planning as a whole will be required. 
Though all partner cities are united by the pressure on urban tissue as a result of rapid growth today or uncontrolled growth in the past, they vary greatly in size and context. Each partner city finds itself at a different stage in the suburbanisation process. In our network, we identify three types of cities in relation to this issue. Firstly, there are cities that are growing demographically and are looking for sustainable ways to increase the densities in their post-war urban areas. The pressure on these areas is becoming even higher. Secondly, there are cities that are experiencing a demographic decline. People are moving into suburban homes in regional areas. To counter this sprawl, improving conditions in the inner cities and the fringes is a clear solution. Finally, there are cities that have already undergone rapid and often uncontrolled growth in recent years and are now facing the consequences of this process. Although these cities are currently not growing demographically, the challenge for them is twofold: they have to improve the quality of these areas and make them more sustainable. In many of these areas, densification often had the upper hand to quality.
The urban fringe area is the zone in between high-density urban and low-density suburban areas, where development pressure is often intense. 
These differences allow us to look at the topic from many different angles and promote local innovation through the exchange of experience. However, this demands a solid framework for sharing expertise and best practices – a framework that clearly defines the topic and relevant subthemes and assists with the gathering of data that can then be meaningfully compared. 
   This State of the Art therefore defines the network topic and relevant subthemes and aims to establish the framework for sharing. It presents current related policies, knowledge, networks and research at EU level on the sustainable regeneration of existing 20th-century peripheral urban areas. Furthermore, it identifies international examples of good practice in this field and describes relevant innovative planning approaches and tools already out there. Many of these examples and approaches are drawn from the book The Flexible City, sustainable solutions for Europe in transition (January 2016, NAi010), which is closely related to the network topic. The synthesis summarises the lessons learnt, as well as critical factors and preconditions for success. 
Terms and their use. 
There are many possible definitions of the urban fringe and related terms such as urban periphery, transitional belt or peri-urban areas. Collins English Dictionary defines ‘the fringe’ as outer edge, margin or periphery. Oxford Dictionary describes ‘the fringe’ as the outer or less important part of an area. In this baseline study the term ‘urban fringe’ is interpreted as the zone between high density urban and low-density suburban areas, where development pressure is or has often been intense. Sometimes these fringe areas are (partly) situated in other municipalities. Moreover they can even be in a high-density polycentric setting, as is the case for Barcelona. Sometimes the fringe is still a low-density area within the city borders. For example in Antwerp the sites contains single family detached housing. The two examples have in common that the urban fringe is a transitional belt, an area with mixed, sporadic functions between the dense inner city and the less dense peripheral single family areas of cities. The glossary provides definitions of important and frequently used terms in this baseline study.
1.1 EU CONTEXT. 
Nearly every European city, town and village expanded considerably after the Second World War. As a result, Europe is among the most urbanised continents in the world. 70% of the EU population reside in cities, towns and suburbs. 80% of these people enjoy living in the city. 70% of the GDP is produced in metropolitan areas. This demographic and economic growth of cities implies also a new task for our cities: existing post-war urban areas now require maintenance and have to undergo alterations to meet changing requirements and future demands. In many cases they also offer opportunities to increase the densities of our cities. Upgrading these existing buildings and urban areas has therefore become an increasingly important task for European towns and cities. 
Compact Cities. 
Cities are first and foremost human settlements that should be developed to improve the living conditions and the environment of current and future residents, as stated in the Riga Declaration of Ministers towards the EU Urban Agenda of 10 June 2015. The sub>urban theme unites cities and regions that want to achieve this enhanced quality of life by carefully increasing the densities of 20th-century post-war urban tissues at the periphery of the historic centres instead of expanding the urban territory. This makes the upgrade of the urban fringe in between the historic city centre and current suburbs an important alternative to both urban sprawl and inner city saturation in the ambition to develop sustainable compact cities. ‘The compact city or city of short distances’ is an urban planning and urban design concept that promotes relatively high residential density with mixed land uses. It is based on an efficient public transport system and features an urban layout that encourages walking and cycling, low energy consumption and reduced pollution. The need for compact cities and smart growth does not only apply to cities that are growing demographically but also to cities experiencing a demographic decline. Though many of those cities are faced with decreasing numbers of residents, land use in the suburbs, congestion and air pollution are still on the rise, even there. 
Urban Sprawl. 
Putting a stop to urban sprawl and working toward more intensive and better quality use of existing urban areas is a goal underpinned by many European policies and networks. In 2006, the report titled Urban Sprawl in Europe, the ignored challenge by the European Environment Agency (EEA) already highlighted the danger of local policies being too isolated in overcoming the serious impact of urban sprawl, and the need for action at EU level. In addition, the European Commission report titled Cities of Tomorrow that was published in 2011 describes many negative outcomes of urban sprawl.
Sub>urban’s added value. 
Our network topic is a broad but important one that touches upon many existing and past initiatives in relation to sustainable regeneration. The rethinking and regeneration of the urban fringe poses an important challenge for European cities in general. What sets this network apart is that it is specifically looking at the urban fringe for sustainable regeneration combined with the focus on the process rather than the design. Our network will put the challenge of sustainable urban fringe regeneration on the map, but also recognises that we are still at the beginning of a task that has been neglected for too long. We want to contribute to the dialogue on how to improve the quality of the urban fringe and what the future may look like, but we do not believe in ready-made solutions. As we are essentially dealing with existing urban areas, it is crucial that we zoom in and understand the local context. Doing so in nine different contexts in Europe, comparing them, sharing local challenges and solutions, and exchanging methods and ideas, will be an important element of added value within our network.
1.2 TOPIC PERSPECTIVE. 
The urban fringe area is the zone between high-density urban and low-density suburban areas, where development pressure is or has been often intense. It appears as a fragmented car based collage landscape made up of modernistic urban areas, old village nuclei, industrial zones and recreational areas, cut by heavy infrastructure. Most of the property is privately owned – and therefore often lacks a collective layer for achieving improvements. For many cities the fringe is a fragmented unsustainable belt of often sub-optimal land usage close to their inner cities. Inefficient land-use and urban highways create high car-dependency and underused space. In some cities that are already further in their development process, like the polycentric conurbation of Barcelona for instance, the fringe area is already very dense but is lacking quality and facing social issues. Socioeconomic segregation in the urban fringe with pockets of social deprivation, often coexist with low-waged jobs. 
Sub>urban is aimed at developing physical planning approaches and tools, that should guide and stimulate transformation processes in the urban fringe. Transformation that aims to achieve more attractive and efficiently organised areas that can both include and improve the lives of existing communities while also creating sustainable new homes and jobs when necessary. 
Inner City Renewal. 
In the past decades, urban development and planning practices in European cities and regions focused on the renewal of metropolitan cores and historic inner cities. This resulted in numerous success stories. In many European cities, the historic city centre is now in good shape. They are popular places providing mixed functions, a solid structure, high-quality public spaces and a clear identity. A lot of money and attention has been, and is still being, invested in this area. The success of inner city renewal is partly due to the specific urban pattern and tissue, with on the one hand the functional and historical diversity of individual plots, and on the other hand a clear structure based on the division between public space and private building blocks (which the individual plots are part of). Thanks to this tissue, the renewal of most inner cities was able to take place plot by plot, each in its own time, since this clearly defined way of organising land is strong enough to hold everything together. There has rarely been a need for lot-transcending collaboration. Most of the time, municipalities only needed to focus on public space and the strategic insertion of amenities. These efforts were usually combined with social investments, while the economic and physical successes in inner cities are characterised at the same time by gentrification. 
Many inner cities have now reached their peak in terms of density, population and mobility. Cities that are still growing demographically and do not want to or cannot sprawl any more, need to look at other areas within the city to accommodate the growing population. Even cities that are experiencing a demographic decline and want to counter the sprawl and migration to their suburbs and neighbouring municipalities, now need to consider other areas in addition to the inner cities as convincing alternatives for the sprawl.
  Shift to the Urban Fringe.
For many European cities the pressure, challenges and opportunities of developments are now shifting to the urban fringe, since the fringe is more closely located than the suburbs and densities and prices are still relatively low compared to the inner city. Besides the earlier mentioned cities that have already succeeded in their inner city renewal, there are still many cities which could not complete inner city regeneration. But even they have to consider the fringe areas as an alternative to urban sprawl, whilst continuing to deal with their inner city. Besides offering an alternative to sprawl, there can even be a financial reason for those cities to prioritize interventions in the transitional belt over inner city renewal, since it is often cheaper there. Another exception are cities like Barcelona where the fringe has already been rapidly densified over the past decades, resulting in high dense monofunctional areas lacking quality and a good future perspective. 
   One can see how it would make sense to a lot of cities to add new housing, jobs and amenities to the urban fringe in a sustainable way. At the same time, most of the existing housing in these areas is in need of renovation or upgrades and social issues need to be addressed. Many areas are underused, cut off by infrastructure, threatened by air pollution or facing soil contamination. All these challenges and opportunities demand that the urban fringe be reread and redefined. To be able to understand the interventions that would make sense, we must first take a closer look at what is already there.
   The urban fringe is a pragmatic land consumption and car-based space that is often missing a collective layer. It includes many monofunctional areas (lacking a decent mix of housing, amenities, retail and work space), insufficient and inefficient public transport facilities, and underused space. The urban fringe of most European cities falls short of a clear structure, good public space and a clear identity. It has always been the logistical back of the inner city. The place where things that were not desirable in our cities were banned to. The place where workers were economically housed, and goods were produced, stored and transported. 
   Another characteristic of the urban fringe is the lack of relation between the various elements in this often fragmented landscape. Buildings and even entire neighbourhoods are usually positioned in the area based on pragmatic reasons only. Juxtapositions seem rather random, and buildings often differ greatly in scale. The components of the urban fringe are the result of a serial logic in which different standard solutions per sector are repeatedly positioned alongside each other. In that sense, the urban fringe is not designed as much as it is a consequence of various development logics colliding. The outcome is a poor-quality environment for living and working, and a city that reads and feels like a disorganised patchwork of differences. Unexpected relations and leaps in scale yield just as many strange combinations as unproductive borderline cases. Therefore, the relations between the elements that are already present in the 20th-century urban fringe need to be considered from a different angle. Also, public space in the urban fringe, which is mainly ‘leftover’ space resulting from car infrastructures cutting through the urban fabric, needs to be reviewed. This public space should become much more than just a functional space. The human scale needs to be better introduced. This leads us to the view that the goals for sustainability and EU2020 will be very hard, if not impossible, to reach for cities, without substantial restructuring and urban transformation of the urban fringe.
Best of Both Worlds.
The characteristics of the urban fringe also provide an important opportunity to counter urban sprawl as well as inner city saturation. Having more amenities and being closer to the city centre than the low-density suburbs is one of these characteristics.
On the other hand, the urban fringe offers more space and includes more (or is situated more closely to) green space than the city centre. In other words, the urban fringe holds the promise of combining the best of both worlds. 
To fully benefit the combination of both worlds, there are a few challenges. The first requires to look into innovative housing types and suitable environments for a wide target group. These are different from the typical urban apartments and suburban freestanding houses. Another important challenge is how the interests of the ‘insiders’ (the people who already live and work there) meet with the interests of the ‘outsiders’ (the newcomers). The densification of peripheries can cause conflict situations. In essence this is based on a changing environment: an increase of the density of housing, shrinking green areas, less parking spaces, et cetera. In conclusion this threat for the insiders needs to be taken into consideration as well as the needs of the newcomers. The conflict of interest makes it challenging for the public administration to manage the transition process of urban regeneration.
Three types of cities. 
The rethinking and regeneration of these areas therefore poses an important challenge for European cities in general. In our network, we identify three types of cities in relation to this topic. First, there are cities that are growing demographically and are looking for sustainable ways to increase the densities in their post-war urban areas. In these cities, the pressure on these originally suburban areas to become more dense and urban, is high. Second, there are cities that are experiencing a demographic decline, where people are moving into suburban homes in regional areas. Here, improving conditions in the inner cities and the fringes is a way to counter sprawl. And third, there are cities that have already undergone rapid and often uncontrolled growth in recent years and are now facing the consequences of this process. Although these cities are currently not growing demographically, it is equally challenging for them to not only improve the quality of these areas but also make them more sustainable, since in many of these areas, quality was sacrificed for densification. 
   In any case, the main question remains: how can we improve the appeal and quality of the existing 20th-century urban tissue? How can we add a new urban layer to achieve this, and make our future urban fringe more mixed and resilient? The space where suburbanisation first occurred is ready for a second layer of urbanisation.  
Process-Oriented Network. 
Urban transformation requires a different approach and a different set of instruments than urban expansion. The aim of this network is to develop useful strategies for reinventing and transforming the 20th-century urban fringe by uncovering new planning practices, processes, instruments and partnerships. The emphasis of our network therefore lies on the process. How to successfully implement this process is of greater importance than developing ideal spatial planning solutions that will never be realised or used in the way they were intended. A successful, sustained transformation process and increased quality of the urban fringe requires an integral vision and a holistic approach touching on many topics. It involves the intensified use of existing structures, good and affordable housing solutions, proper amenities, job opportunities, efficient sustainable mobility, city branding, and dealing with private and fragmented ownership. 
This network will therefore look into the following subthemes, which are described in more detail in the following chapters: 
Transforming for intensified use. 
Transforming for social inclusion. 
Transforming the relationship with the region. 
Transforming private space. 
Transforming planning.
1.2.1. Transforming for intensified use. 
Densities in the 20th-century urban fringe are often low compared to inner cities. There is much oversized public space, as well as many single-storey buildings, large parking lots and vacant buildings and land. From this perspective, it is obvious that these urban areas can be used more intensively. Instead of constructing new urban areas on greenfields outside the city, transforming the urban fringe would make better use of and further improve existing urban structures. Intensifying the use of public space, vacant and underused buildings and land, is an important challenge in achieving compact cities. Housing and amenities can be added and improved in the urban fringe instead of being created anew in the suburbs 
Public space. 
Most public space is used for car and railroad infrastructures that lead to and from the city. These infrastructures cut through the fringe and create huge barriers. This reinforces poor interconnectivity and the segregation of areas. Addressing these problematic edges around the city is an important challenge in improving the use of public space and creating a new future for these areas. 
   Some 20th-century developments have vast green and undefined open spaces typical of modernistic post-war CIAM town planning. The generous dimensions of these 20th-century developments now offer new possibilities and more opportunities in comparison to the historic city centres. They provide room for comprehensive sustainability concepts and technologies, such as wider streets that allow for more green space, and opportunities in terms of heat networks because of their proximity to industrial sites. 
   Other developments include much less public space due to the effect of rapid and uncontrolled urban growth during the 20th century. The size of private dwellings and land areas was maximized, leaving no room for footpaths and properly integrated parking facilities. How can this type of public space be improved? 
Vacant and underused areas. 
Since most of the cities in our network are growing and are choosing not to do so through sprawl developments, the number one question remains: where and how can more dwellings and amenities be added to existing urban tissues? Within the urban fringe, there are often many vacant or underused buildings and sites. Vacant office buildings 20can be transformed into housing or for other much-needed purposes. Unused and underused industrial sites can be transformed into mixed-use urban areas. Single-storey supermarkets can be redeveloped into multipurpose buildings that include housing and underground parking facilities. This way, the quality can be improved and the density increased. 
To determine how areas can best be intensified, we first need a meticulous analysis of what is already there. Where are these low-quality buildings and sites located? What needs to be improved? Where can new and more intensive programmes be added? Who are the owners? What is the current energy label of these buildings and how can they be improved? Does the structure of the building allow for repurposing? Which regulations have to be taken into account? How can this be funded? Using and intensifying what is already there also means discovering unforeseen opportunities in the use of existing structures. Temporary use can play an important role in taking the first step towards the regeneration of unused and underused buildings and sites.
1.2.2 Transforming for social inclusion. 
Unlike with new constructions in urban expansion zones, the transformation of existing buildings or areas always impacts local residents. Often regeneration conflicts with the interests of people living and working there, since their direct environment changes. The area might get more dense, less green and gentrification might occur. Regeneration in the urban fringe should therefore also consider the interests of the people currently living there. It should be aimed towards mixed cultural and ethnic backgrounds and people of different incomes, education levels and ages. In other words: reinforcing the city as a platform for diversity and serendipity. Therefore, the challenge also lies in spreading the benefits of growth and regeneration equally and in providing affordable housing, high quality public space, jobs and facilities for all. 
Affordable housing. 
Preventing social segregation requires a high-quality, differentiated supply of affordable, attractive, accessible housing, close enough to essential services for the general public, including for more vulnerable citizens. Successfully providing innovative housing types for a wide target group, different from the typical urban apartments and suburban freestanding houses, is a major challenge for the cities in this project. Stimulating the production of affordable housing demands innovative social housing provision and financing models, including government funding and market incentives, taking into account what types of tenure forms already exist and what types could be attracted to the area. 
Mixed Use 
Mixed-use development means creating a building, complex or area that includes a mixture of land uses. Many areas in the urban fringe are monofunctional and encourage spatial segregation. They include residential areas, industrial sites, office areas, etc. Mixing jobs and amenities with housing makes any area more self-reliable and decreases the need to commute to other areas. Preventing social exclusion means providing job opportunities and services for all educational backgrounds, and rethinking public spaces and infrastructures to suit various ages and cultures. It also requires schools, retail stores, recreational and cultural facilities, and employment for both current and future residents. 
Housing is an aggressive element in cities. It puts pressure on land in the sense that it often pushes out jobs and productivity. One general observation in this regard is that over the past years, urban development projects often involved converting abandoned industrial sites into new residential areas. Business and especially employment opportunities were often forgotten or pushed out. We want to learn from this observation when reconverting 20th-century urban areas, making the most of the often larger parcels of land and dimensions to really integrate industry, work, retail and housing. Other themes that will be explored by the partners are the development of a new urban economy, integrating production in the city, and providing more low-skilled jobs in environments with mostly skilled labour demands. It is an important challenge to maintain and improve job and productivity opportunities in these existing areas.
1.2.3 Transforming the relationship with the region. 
Traditionally, the urban fringe used to be the edge of the city, subordinate to the historic city centre. A logistics area intersected by major infrastructures linking the city centre to regions outside the city. Providing a mass of opportunities between the low-density suburbs and the high-density city centre, the connectivity and identity of the urban fringe needs to be re-examined on a regional scale. Often, this also means dealing with various public authorities as the fringe crosses political borders and a variety of ownership structures. 
Connectivity. 
The urban fringe is an area with a relatively large number of infrastructures and barriers. The fact that the main infrastructure linking the city centre to the outer regions cuts through the fringe for the most part, has resulted in many isolated and poorly connected areas. Other downsides are poor air quality and noise nuisance. How to improve the existing infrastructure and how to overcome barriers in these types of urban areas, are important questions we need to address. Another challenge in the regeneration of these areas is that sustainable mobility choices must be promoted, and that we must support the development of a more efficient public transport network. Sustainable alternatives to car travel, such as public transport and a decent bicycle infrastructure, must be developed and made more widely available. When improving connectivity, the focus should not only be on connecting outer areas to the city centre, but also on their interconnectivity with other peripheral areas. 
Identity. 
In addition to the physical aspect, there is a mental aspect to the relationship between the urban fringe and the region, and between the fringe and the city centre. With the pressure on urban fringe development arises the opportunity to redefine and improve these former suburbs, no longer as towns or outskirts subordinate to the city centre, but as self-conscious districts. With more amenities and closer proximity to the city centre than the low-density suburbs on the one hand, and offering more green space and more space in general than the city centre on the other hand, the urban fringe holds the promise of combining the best of both worlds. How can identities be formed and enhanced in relation to other peripheral areas and the city centre? How can we intervene in this area? How can we give it a new and appealing image that builds effectively on what is already there? 
Key opportunities for enhancing sustainability and creating a new future for the urban fringe are to be found at regional level – the level at which economic networks usually operate and landscape features manifest themselves. Yet, administrative borders in Europe are often found either at a lower level (the municipality or district) or at a higher level (the province or nation). This makes it difficult to reach sound agreements regarding the development of business parks or housing, for instance, or regarding strategies concerning the countryside, the preservation of historical structures, or the establishment or closure of amenities. Decisions on these matters at municipal level could create undue competition while decisions at provincial or national level could overlook regional opportunities or disregard regional sensitivities. Greater sustainability requires a solid regional coordination mechanism. In some cases the periphery of the city is already outside of the administrative area of the city (e.g. the French cities). In such cases the urban association (communauté urbaine) can create the opportunity to deal with most important joint problems. Regarding the challenges of regional coordination, major cities such as Vienna and Düsseldorf, peripheral municipalities such as Solin and Casoria, and regional authority Metropolitan Area of Barcelona are assets to our network.
1.2.4 Transforming private space. 
Urban expansion, when agricultural land is transformed into urban zones, involves a considerable increase in value and large land ownerships. Transforming existing urban areas is more expensive and often means having to deal with fragmented private ownership – from residents owning a single apartment to major global agglomerates that invest in shopping malls or office developments. As most municipalities do not own a lot of land and buildings, it is imperative to make the right decisions and negotiate agreements in the public interest when regenerating existing urban areas. How can collaborations between private and public stakeholders be improved to achieve the best possible quality through a fair process? 
Fragmented Ownership and Missing Collective layers. 
Cities tend to focus on enhancing public space because of their experience with inner city upgrades, and because owning this land makes it relatively easy to create an impact. However, the poor quality of most existing dwellings and vacant or underused buildings and sites remains unchanged, since private owners are not motivated to make improvements. On the one hand, many buildings were constructed during the post-war building boom, prior to the energy crisis. Most of these are in need of renovation work and are poorly insulated. On the other hand, many areas could be used better and more intensively, such as large single-storey supermarkets, large open-air parking lots, etc., as they eat up a lot of land. There is plenty of potential in 20th-century urban areas, and a lot of dormant capital. However, divided ownership and the fact that most cities do not own much land there (anymore) have turned this into a complex challenge. Dealing with fragmented private ownership to make areas and buildings more sustainable often requires municipalities to take on a different role from the one they are used to. How to kick-start this process? Not by developing a master plan, but through dynamics: creating acceptance, putting together a coalition of the willing, offering development potential and opportunities, catering to the needs of residents, all within the context of a broader strategy and ambition. An especially difficult challenge is presented by reclaimed property in former Eastern Block cities. 
Transparency. 
The role of municipalities in the urban regeneration process is often twofold. On the one hand, its urban planning department defines the strategic plans and zoning plans and therefore determines the development potential of a site. On the other hand, they have to verify that everything is done according to the regulations and these plans. When trying to push and facilitate private partners towards certain developments, this could lead to a grey zone, and it makes their double role of ambitious creator and strict judge increasingly difficult. It may even lead to suspicion of corruption and favouritism. But as a public authority that has to encourage openness of government, it also means that in doing so, the municipalities are not operating in a level playing field when dealing with large private companies shielded by corporate secrecy and expensive lawyers. Which models of procurement, public private partnerships and processes are best suited for urban regeneration?
1.2.5 Transforming spatial planning. 
Urban transformation requires a different approach and a different set of instruments than urban expansion. The aim of this network is to develop useful strategies for reinventing and transforming the urban fringe by uncovering new planning practices, processes, instruments and partnerships. Instead of working with a fixed blueprint, it involves flexible planning and strategic pilots. This way, a parallel development of experimental settings as well as an action plan for tangible results can be achieved. The objective is to plan, learn and implement at the same time – complementing concrete findings with the ambitions of the strategic plan, and vice versa. 
Flexible Planning. 
Linear blueprint planning, where plans are fixed by a small group of experts, has proven not to be able to deal very well with the complexity, unpredictability and limited funds usually associated with urban regeneration. Instead of determining outcome by design, focusing on the process and its dynamics is much more productive. This does not mean letting go of quality-related goals, but rather adding a broader definition instead of looking at these as the only possible outcome. It also means clearly excluding what is not desired, and setting the scope of ambition. The possibilities for developments or redevelopments are determined by these ambitions, often described in a strategic plan, together with process-related, legal, financial and spatial planning boundaries. If a development is seen as a stepwise incremental process rather than a single undertaking, it can gradually take shape based on existing qualities, allowing users and other stakeholders to gain more influence, thereby making it easier to respond to and take advantage of unforeseen and unforeseeable social dynamics. In the field of flexible area development, each individual development explicitly forms part of a continuous process. Each step can feed the learning process and can help the master plan grow. 
   In the quest for planning practices that enable transformation, the sub>urban partners are not only interested in strategies as such. They are also eager to discover the roles of local and regional governments in the ongoing development of their cities. The local governments’ roles in the renewal of inner cities have mostly been to initiate, coordinate and/or direct projects that are generally well-defined. Should we prepare for a substantial shift towards enabling and facilitating roles in mostly organic and informal processes? What are the tools needed to take on these new roles, and are these instruments within reach of local and regional governments today? 
Strategic Pilots. 
In addition to thinking at strategic level on the scale of the city and the region, this project is about the implementation of local action plans as strategic pilots, and on a more zoomed-in scale, it serves as a testing ground with an urban acupuncture approach. Sub>urban aims at renewing the city by rethinking our concept of the city. By doing research through concrete pilot projects, the project partners aim to improve current concepts of urban development and find and test new strategies, partnerships, financial models, procedures, regulations and new building typologies for housing, amenities, school buildings and offices. As it is impossible to finance and initiate everything at the same time, it is important to choose these strategic sites well, so they can influence and contribute to further planning on a larger scale. Modest steps, even temporary ones, that are well chosen can ultimately have big consequences.

"SUITE.
The Housing Project.
Preface.
The frequently heard assertion that housing is an exclusively national issue and responsibility takes on rather cynical significance in view of the current worldwide financial crisis which began in the housing sector of real estate. Now, at the beginning of October 2008, as I finalise this study, nobody can predict what the situation will be when the auditors read these pages. In any case the housing sector and housing policy will also not be the same after the crisis and the credit crunch. 
A. State of the Art in Europe. 
This brief overview of the European situation and discussion approaches the question, if and how ‘social housing’ could further guarantee good quality of life for the more disadvantaged part of the European population, in four chapters. In Part A.1 housing policy is addressed, starting from the role of social housing within the current housing situation, on national and local levels, to the European dimension as well as the European Union context in the housing question, with a special focus on European Regional Policy. Part A.2 Housing and social inclusion stresses that housing plays an eminent role for the poor, and can be a dangerous poverty trap. Thus, the EU Social Inclusion Policy includes housing questions. A main objective regarding housing – its affordability – will be briefly highlighted, discussing the role of social mix for a sustainable quality of life. The issue of Part A.3, housing and environmental sustainability, forms a further main challenge. The Baseline study comments on the current status of the issue and the impact of housing related measures on global and European levels and raises some questions on the financial aspects of high environmental quality. Part A.4 will discuss whether there are examples of good programmes and good practice in integrating both social and environmental aspects. In the scientific discourse, apart from short-term policy shifts, we can assign European countries to several types, which reflect aspects of these preferences. Due to big political changes, recent decades showed radical shifts from one type of housing policy to another, especially in former communist countries and New Member States. The transformation led to strong liberalisation and the transfer of the housing stock either to the former owners or to sitting tenants as new owners. However, the extent of change considerably varied among the countries. Not only on national governmental level, but also on the level of provinces (in the case of federal systems), regions, other smaller organised entities (such as agglomerations or conurbations) and cities, housing policy plays a decisive role regarding regulatory and financial competencies. Even within cities, housing supply and housing regeneration is often dealt on the level of districts or neighbourhoods. In general, most politicians agree that at least some intervention in housing markets makes sense, aside from basic shortages, taking into account the usual cycles in supply and demand4. In times of a slowdown of economic growth, variable job markets and high prices of basic food and energy (times in which we currently live) efficient housing policy as a means for balance, relief and stabilisation takes on increasing importance. Furthermore, it is in the meantime undoubted that measures in the fields of spatial planning, construction and residential housing-related energy consumption can have a decisive impact on the achievement of the Kyoto Objectives regarding the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions5. Therefore, environmental policy builds a link to housing policy, which will be reflected in our URBACT II SUITE network. 
A.1 Housing Policy. 
Housing policy is, above all, national governmental policy with the objective to influence the market to provide sufficient and affordable stock. As ‘housing’ itself is a hybrid of the common good – indispensable for all – and commercial good, this is quite a challenge and permanently a subject of ideological discourse. There is a wide diversity of ideas on how to influence the market which is closely linked to political programmes and, furthermore, influenced by national history and culture. This results in national preferences for forms of housing tenure and various policies for public funding. ‘Fundamentally, housing policy instruments may take the form of taxation, regulation, activation, competition and subsidisation.’2 Very simply, it could be stated that liberal and conservative parties advocate only little state intervention in the housing market and place more emphasis on ownership, home ownership or condominium, whilst governments from the left favour stronger state influence, mostly by public funding, and often a more dominant role of tenancy. 
B. Synthesis. 
Emails, attachments, desk research, site visits, pictures, presentations, group discussions, with or without translator, phone calls, flipcharts, flights, trains, cars, Pole meetings, instructions, reading and writing for six months - to formulate a concise synthesis, which brings the whole picture to the point, is quite a challenge. Inevitably, it remains superficial and rudimentary, but it has led to a basis for a joint application, which might meet the requirements. My sincere thanks indeed to all who have contributed, maybe around fifty committed people from all over Europe 
C.1 Rainbow or clear line? - The broad variety of housing situation and policy. 
C.1.1 On the starting blocks. 
It would not be Europe if not housing did not also demonstrate a multicoloured rainbow of situation and solutions, precisely housing, because in reality it is so strongly ‘bound to the ground’ and has for so long been guarded jealously as a national competence. It is no different among the ten partners of this network (cities and conurbations) who only provide a comparable pattern to a limited extent, even if they are from the same country. The idea to demonstrate this variety by including two different cities from a country (as we did for France, UK and Poland) was the right approach. Local and regional conditions are striking for the conditions of housing people in a decent and affordable way, especially those on low income. It is thus all the more surprising that very soon the common discussion and the method of a step by step concretion of the selection of main issues to be worked on showed a clear line of common challenges and expectations. Of course, the relative importance varies, as do the dimension and urgency, but obviously the role of a satisfactory housing situation and the role of a common European background (development in economy, employment and income, in demography, lifestyle and migration) has such a decisive impact on city level that the network was able to define a common set of issues. This clearly demonstrates that housing is a ‘European issue’ and is an important factor in social inclusion. The network brings together a broad variety of cities or conurbations. However, this is of course an integral quality of URBACT networks, and should be seen as a specific quality which positively influences the exchange of ideas and experiences and common learning. Apart from the varying dimensions of the cities (from about 70,000 to 1.7 million inhabitants, on average 200,000 to 500,000; areas on average 250 km2), which of course have a decisive impact on the dimension of the housing problem, we also gather shrinking or stagnating cities as well as growing cities, with mostly moderate, but some stronger prospects. Thus, the pressure on the housing market will develop quite differently. However, the most important differences lie in the scope of influence of the public body on housing stock and new construction for the provision of people on low income. In our network there are cities with quite different patterns of tenure. There are those with an outstanding proportion of condominium or home ownership, also in the stock accessible for people on lower income (e.g. in the Medway conurbation). Also publicly funded new construction almost exclusively concentrates on these forms of tenure. Some are much more mixed (French and German cities, but also Newcastle, UK). Furthermore, it is also relevant that currently both countries are struggling with a big crisis on the housing market, in the real estate field. There are already growing influences of this situation on the whole European economy (but finally, as we have now learned from the end of September 08, the impact of the sub-prime bubble and crisis – also a ‘housing story’ - tops them all in its incredible enormity). A special situation exists in the partner cities from New Member States, depending on the national housing policy chosen after transition. Cities with almost no municipal housing stock (after selling or giving away mainly the post WW II former communist social housing stock to sitting tenants) such as Iasi, Romanian Moldavia, or Tallinn, Estonia, meet cities with a relevant public rental stock (e.g. Siemianowice near Katowice, including a ‘heritage’ of former enterprise housing, Poland). Problems regarding the maintenance and the refurbishment of this stock are apparent. Also, it is common to all these cities that they are heavily burdened by the obligation to house people evicted from ‘restituted’ (given back to former private landlords) housing. Other cities in the network show a more balanced mix of ownership and tenancy. In these cities, there is broader scope for manoeuvring in times of increased need for affordable housing. (Some examples: Hamburg, Nantes Métropole, Rennes Métropole).) We find wide variations of landlords (the municipality itself, special bodies or housing associations owned by the city, no or limited profit or private housing associations, cooperatives or private landlords in arrangements with municipalities). New construction partly shows new arrangements, mostly in public private partnership. This interferes with a broad scope of accessibility for different groups, mostly oriented to income level and to specific needs. To know more about the different meanings of terms such as `social housing’ to ‘very social housing’, municipal or council housing, publicly funded, subsidised housing, targeted housing etc. etc., see part A State of the Art, of this Baseline Study. One of the first steps in phase 2 will be to develop some sort of matrix overview of these variations, based on the information already collected. Without such a tool to help mutual understanding, it would be difficult to proceed. Phase 1 discussions already showed the broad scope for misunderstanding. Part A ‘State of the Art’ also describes the broad variety of tools used by public bodies for social housing policy. This ranges from supply side support (land provision, subsidies for regeneration and new construction) to demand side support (housing allowances to tenants, favourable loans to purchasers, standing surety etc.). The strategic basis of such tools is a variety of positions towards the role of social housing (see A.1 and A.2 ‘State of the Art’: policy - ‘targeted’ versus ‘broad’.) It would be fine to be able to show a typical city or several cities from our network for each of these cases and models. However, the puzzle is too diverse to do so. And however, it is fascinating to see that despite this variety of 'background', a clear tendency in focusing on a couple of key issues became visible. For more regarding housing policy and programmes, please see C.2.3 Programmes and policies – towards implementation. 
C.1.2 Demographic challenge and changing life careers. 
Fertility, mortality and net migration are the three main pillars on which the structure of housing demand is based. Thus, looking at demographic data and prognoses is always the first step towards approaching an integrated view. Again, our comparison of the current situation evinces relevant differences between the partners. Whilst the more general demographic development towards an ageing society and with societal changes in the lifecycles of households (less stability, smaller households …) are common for European cities, the proportions of age groups and household types are still quite different. In the proportion of people aged 60plus there is a difference of 1: 1,5 (some cities in New Member States still have a ‘younger’ population, the maximum, in OMS, is more than 20% of 60plus). The increase of single households, which has a significant impact on housing demand, varies from 10 to 15% (e.g. Iasi, Tallinn, NMS) up to 50%, 60% (Hamburg, Krakow), average: around a third. Many of them are aged people. Also, needs of single parents, the overwhelming majority women, is well know in all partner cities. There are differences between a higher demand, but of smaller dwellings, and, in other cities, a special demand for dwelling for larger families. 
C.1.3 The poverty trap -financial viability and affordability. 
All our partner cities stress a high need of provision of affordable housing, not only since the price increase of this year, but already before (see the discussion in part A 2.1 and A.2.3). Of course, their starting points, the ‘level of affordability’ differs considerably, especially if the proportion of public subsidies is taken into account. The partner profiles in Part B provide definitions of ‘affordable housing’ from all partners. The variations in the role of tenancy and home ownership, as well as the diverging proportions of housing stock per building period (which refers to the housing cost level) makes it quite difficult to compare. A thematic working group within the network will concentrate on economic questions starting from a more in-depth discussion on the scope of backgrounds regarding ‘affordability’ (more see C.3.2). The partners confirmed that also in their housing stock residents are especially affected by an increase of running costs. The principal positions towards public funding, but also the scope of action for cities will be relevant for the definition and for the selection of ‘good practice’. There is a range of specific groups, whose urgent specific needs are formulated. Apart from older people or single parents, for some cities, housing migrants or ethnic minorities is a prominent task. This concerns both newcomers and groups living in very often un-decent housing for a long period. However, the proportion of these groups among the population vary considerably, from almost no migrants (cities in NMS) to nearly 15% (Hamburg), a special case is Tallinn with about one third Russians. The group the most difficult to house seem to be Roma, travelling or resident, but just for some of the partners (Nantes M., Rennes M., Iasi, …) and the Homeless. 
C.1.4 Environment and energy costs. 
In the countries involved, national regulations on the protection of the environment and on energy saving are in use, complying with EU regulations and Kyoto objectives. However, mainly in NMS there are complaints from cities, that often the implementation of this kind of regulations is not back lined by sufficient financial means, and that there is a lack of regulated supervision of these regulations. National programmes for high quality and energy efficiency in housing are common, but partly remain on a voluntary or general level. In some countries, broad and elaborated concepts are existing, and there are links to the (local) Agenda 21. Cities in our network prove to be ambitious in topping national standards. Some of them include those objectives in the Local Housing Plan (also for ‘social’ respectively ‘affordable housing`). Standards refer to new construction, in rehabilitation such standards do not seem to be compulsory. However, some cities can show aspiring programmes on ecologically sustainable refurbishment, together with funding programmes. Again, there are differences in funding schemes for the social and the private sector. All partners define the linkage of high environmental standard and affordability as a very big challenge. 
C.2 Motivation and drivers of change - the main interests of the partners. 
By the help of a complex process of collecting individual formulation from the partners and a common discussion, we arrived on a common ‘set of interests’, which would form the content of our exchange. Tenor of all interests is how to meet future increasing challenges of fighting both poverty and climate change. The most recent reactions on the financial crisis – to question the objectives of the climate package on carbon-reduction targets – show the relevance of this question. Thus, three main groups of questions were defined, social, economic and environmental, and three according working groups were installed, who drafted more precise sub-themes for the common learning. Taking into account the broad variety of situation and focus, a dominant challenge will be to work on the transferability issue in a structured way. Of course, this serves only as a guideline. There is also a rationale at the respective local levels. And it can of course happen that one or the other partners will only discover that new questions are relevant for them after all during the course of the exchange. This is also part of the nature of common learning. Hence, we will revise our chosen questions at regular intervals. 
C.2.1 The scope of action for the cities. 
The member of the network agreed that sufficient competencies and financial capability on the local level are key for coping with the main challenges. The framework for housing policy for the members of our network shows almost all of the current systems and tendencies. Many of them are embedded in strong national frameworks, with small scope for action at city level (all but the one in Germany). Within this group, there are differences regarding the position of their region - e.g. Santiago de Compostela in the Autonomous Region of Galicia, which, however, leaves housing competencies mainly to the City), or regarding their own local level of competence (competencies on an agglomeration level also regarding housing in both French ‘Métropoles’ – Nantes and Rennes and on the level of the conurbation for Medway Council, UK (south-east of London). In federal systems, there is mainly a distribution of dedicated means from the national government to the federal states, who are given high competence in designing federal housing policy, including funding for new construction and for regeneration. On the other hand, there is a broad development to shift more and more duties to the local level, but very often without an adequate financial support. Who is responsible for the local housing policy? As a basis for understanding, the network created a matrix showing the various local distributions of competence in the organisations of the partners (municipalities or similar). Furthermore, they describe the competencies in the Partner Profile and prepared team list for the LE visit. (see part B and its annexes.) A review shows a dominance of competence (and participation) of housing departments, with a smooth transition to urban policies and land policies. Partly social departments are closely involved. 
C.2.2 Programmes and policies – towards implementation. 
The partner cities base their current policy on ‘Local Plans on Housing’ or ‘Housing Strategies’, concerted with Local Urban Development Plans. Very often, there is a sub-division among plans on new construction (defining targets) and on regeneration plans. Of course, the scope of action is closely related to the size of the stock of social housing. Any influence on the private market depends on the current market situation and on incentives. Links to labour market plans and social plans are integrated to a different extent. Generally, those plans are very different regarding their regulatory force, depending on country and local situation. Specific local housing policies, actions and initiatives (already developed or planned) partly focus on groups (young families and public servants, Tallinn, Iasi, residents from ‘de-expropriated stock’, Polish cities, Travellers (Nantes Métropole and Rennes Métropole) or on sectors (regeneration of disadvantaged quarters, e.g. Hamburg, renovation financed by stakeholders, Tallinn), to list some. Specific housing policies regarding local environmental standards show promotion of high environmental quality construction, eco-neighbourhoods or funding programs for ecological buildings (Nantes Métropole, Rennes Métropole, Hamburg …) ; high standard regeneration (Newcastle …) or Environment audits (Tallinn). Land policies, actions and initiatives list development schemes for real estate action of the city, local land plans, regulations on a fixed percentage of social housing per housing development. Those types of land policies are closely linked with our focus, but will not form a special focus of the project. Some cities / conurbations inform about projects forming part of much bigger development plans (e.g. Medway Council as part of the Thames Gateway Development Plan). As far as we see already, some Local Action Plans for this URBACT project will link closely to some of those existing plans, even integrating an overwork of existing programmes. 
C.3.1 Social sustainability. 
The importance of creating social sustainability in housing has been explained earlier in this study. Thus, the network was unanimous from the beginning that one of the key objectives should be to ‘make decisive steps forward in developing higher levels of sustainable housing provision, considering the social perspective’. A good social mix was identified as one main tool to reach this objective. But the ‘social mix’ discussion is still ongoing on a broad researchers’ (mostly in social sciences), policy makers’ and practitioners’ level, starting with the question of the definition of ‘good social mix’ and its qualitative and quantitative composition, leading to discussions on steering instruments (soft, by statism, market oriented etc.). (See also part A.2.3) Regarding expectations among the partners and the focus of the related future thematic working group, ‘social mix’ seems to be seen as an underlying paradigm for further developing housing provision and urban space. The working group also defined a need to bring together the implementation of ‘housing rights’ (see A.1.2) and a good social balance of neighbourhood as one central question. The provision of tailored offers to specific groups of users/residents, meeting their special needs, seems to be another tool to succeed in social sustainability. Enhancing living conditions for people with specific needs, taking into account the growing diversity of users, is the underlaying objective. However, it must be stressed that this provision should not conflict with the idea of mixity, by creating monostructures for separated groups. The respective working group wants to work on a ‘conciliation of these principles’. This question found a very broad interest among the partners. As this interest refers to a broad variety of target groups (by age, by type of household, by ethnicity (e.g. Roma), by dis/ability etc.), which the various partners refer to, it is more the underlying common structures of policies and programmes that should be discussed in the project than detailed offers for specific groups. Participation (and maybe also empowerment) are further tools, which currently spark interest among the partners. Firstly, to contribute better knowledge on needs, but also, secondly, to enhance the sustainability of measures by advancing the ties to local action and to the neighbourhood. Especially, including residents in the development of processes introducing environmental standards seems to be a focus (but this leads to the next chapter). The scope of standard and ‘culture’ of participation and empowerment seems to be quite broad among the partners. 
C.3.2 Economic sustainability. 
Facing a ‘crisis of affordability’ in the participating countries and cities, both regarding rents, costs of purchase and running costs on the part of the users - and prices in the construction sector, prices of land, of energy, bank conditions and more on the part of the provider, this issue finds the broadest interest among the partners of the network (the current threat of recession culminates this focus). Again, financing tools and programmes are central, plus an appropriate subsidy policy. Different funding schemes and their impact should be compared (see also A.1.1 and A.2.1). This also leads to the inclusion of a broad range of actors, cooperation or partnership with the private sector and participation of people affected or their representatives. 
C.3.3 High environmental quality. 
The ambitious objective to forge a close link between housing and environmental sustainability is strongly supported by the network partners. They acknowledge their responsibility as public bodies in both directions, on the one hand, to provide a liveable and healthy environment to their inhabitants, and on the other hand, to respond to the common obligation to tackle the consequences of the climate change, and to lower the emission of greenhouse gases, following the Kyoto protocol. (See the discussion of the issue in part A.3.) They are keen to discuss better programming, funding, planning and managing in the housing field to meet these needs. Another thematic work group will focus on this exchange during the project and will start with developing a more in-depth structure of issues to be discussed. Of course, the exchange has to be restricted to a bundle of quite precise questions to work on. The first procedures for limiting the scope (matrix, common discussion, partner profile, brought several topics to the fore. Inclusion of a broad range of actors is again supposed to be a good tool. Thus, the proposed more detailed issues address different groups. On the one hand, how to promote interaction and good governance of local authorities, private sector organisations such as science, architects, the building industry, housing managers and the market etc., which should lead to a high standard of environmental quality? On the other hand, how to address potential users and residents (awareness raising, demand, daily life, participation…)? Generally, in the discussion on the environmental aspects, affordability should always be kept in the back of our minds. Some of the participating cities already support innovative measures and succeed in lowering costs by ‘building up a market’, underpinned by EU and national regulations (as examples: Hamburg, Nantes Métropole). They will provide examples for the discussion. And via the various European thematic associations involved in the SUITE network, we will also be able to integrate broader up-to-date information on innovative practice. Thus, discussing priorities for public investment and funding as well as alternative models will be another more detailed issue to discuss in this thematic work group. 
C.4 The triangular challenge (Social) Housing – financially, socially and environmentally sustainable? 
Pole position in the list of interests is taken by ‘affordability of housing’. However, current access and ideas on how to reach the objective of ‘affordability’ diverge to quite an extent. Thus, the network partners revised approaches together with the LE, and defined the basic objective: to bring together those three strands of sustainability. As it would go beyond the framework of this synthesis, a discussion on the problems of an inadequate connection of those three strands and the danger of segmented housing markets has been added in an annex to this part C, an ‘excursus on approaches’. As already noted before, the concept consists of gathering various contributions on this main issue of the project on the basis of the suggested contributions from network partners (programme, model projects, feedback from participation in other EU projects such as CONCERTO, REBECEE see A.3.1) supplemented by research throughout Europe. To achieve this objective, the most important and challenging part of the common exchange will be to form a synthesis group (selected from the more specialised thematic working groups), which leads a common discussion integrating the findings from the special fields and prepares an overarching final synthesis meeting. The following examination will lead to final conclusions and recommendations. In a nutshell again: The common objective of this Thematic Network (composed of Cities, conurbations and institutions) is to make decisive steps forward in developing higher levels of sustainable housing provision, in the respective local context, considering both the social and environmental perspectives. Combining both perspective the network aims at the improvement of the steering ability of local authorities within a urban policy field characterized by a dynamic development in terms of economical, social, ecological and demographic challenges. This higher level of policy would be based on a broad involvement of different local actors, using open methods of cooperation/participation and a substantial responsiveness for needs of different social groups. The methods chosen to deal with all expectations and contributions on partner level, plus the feedback process with the Local Action Plan level (see below C.5), are based on a triangle of thematic work (coordinated by thematic working groups, integrating thematic meetings and a local-international process of mutual enrichment), culminating at a synergy level on top of the pyramid. A preparatory group among the partners (from France) provided a more detailed draft and a complementary graph of the working groups as a preparation for the synthesis (see Annex of this Part C). The details of the work programme are described in the application

Socio-economic approaches to Urban Rehabilitation.
INNOVATIVE APPROACHES TO SOCIO-ECONOMIC URBAN REHABILIATION.
FOSTERING THE DIVERSIFICATION OF LOCAL ECONOMIES IN DEPRIVED URBAN AREAS.
Most towns in Europe face complex socio-economic challenges. One such challenge is related to deprived neighbourhoods that are located close to the town centre. In small and medium sized towns these neighbourhoods do not tend to offer attractive opportunities for large scale investments and instead hold back their economic development potential. To tackle the complex interactions between social, physical and economic factors which lead to the decline of neighbourhoods requires expertise and resources which often exceed those available to small and medium sized towns. Smaller municipalities therefore are increasingly looking for opportunities to develop their capacity to work more effectively with resident and business communities on the development of integrated and locally sustainable solutions. The SURE network is designed to develop this capacity and to support its partners in the implementation of integrated socioeconomic regeneration strategies which build on local strengths and opportunities. 
INTRODUCTION. 
The SURE Project. 
The SURE project aims to support municipalities from small and medium sized town in the development of strategies which integrate social and economic interventions to regenerate deprived neighbourhoods that are located close to the town centre. Core components of integrated socio-economic approaches in the SURE project include diversifying local economies, promoting community development as well as improving local employment opportunities and housing provision. Throughout the duration of the SURE project partner cities will be supported in the development of such integrated approaches. Concrete outputs of the SURE network include a Local Action Plan for each partner city and a model of integrated socio-economic regeneration which is based on the experience of SURE partners and designed to provide guidance for other practitioners who intend to develop similar strategies for their own towns and cities. 
The Acquis Urban. 
Since their establishment in 1973 the EU Structural Funds have been subject to continuous reform and development. Community Initiatives played a key role in this process because they aimed to enhance the development of good practice for particular areas of EU regional policy. One these Community Initiatives was URBAN which was designed to encourage partnership approaches which would bring about the integration of social, economic and environmental interventions in deprived neighbourhoods. The URBAN initiatives, which operated between 1989 and 2006, were considered to have been highly successful, creating many valuable insights into effective regeneration practice. A further important outcome from URBAN was a recognition that the regeneration of deprived neighbourhoods requires effective partnerships and cross-cutting interventions. In regeneration circles this principle has become known as the Acquis Urban. The Acquis Urban has been effectively mainstreamed for the 2007 – 2013 programming period of the Structural Funds because urban regeneration now forms an integral part of their objectives. Individual member states therefore have to ensure that policy objectives relating to social and economic inclusion in deprived urban areas are identified and prioritised at national, regional and local levels. To support this, the European Commission has put renewed emphasis on effective horizontal and vertical integration of intervention through partnership working: “The partnership principle is a fundamental principle underpinning all aspects of cohesion policy – programming, implementation, monitoring and evaluation – and has now been widely accepted as a key element of good governance. The system of multi-level governance, based on a strategic approach and involving Community, national, regional and local authorities and stakeholders helps to ensure that actions are adapted to circumstances on the ground and that there is genuine commitment to success.” These policy developments at European level are complemented by individual cities coming together to formulate their own perspectives on the nature and importance of integrated strategies for the socio-economic regeneration of cities. The Leipzig Charter on Sustainable European Cities is one such example. It sets out guiding principles on the socio-economic regeneration of deprived neighbourhoods and provides a policy as well as practice oriented perspective on European Union urban policy from the local level. There are then a range of important policy drivers at the European Union, trans-national and local levels which demand that regeneration processes are partnership led and inclusive of local business and resident communities and the civil society organisations active within them. The SURE network intends to utilise these broad policy frameworks in the development of locally sustainable socio-economic regeneration strategies. While each partner city will have its own way of using existing European Union policy to its advantage, SURE will support this through structured learning and exchange between the partners as well as technical guidance on internationally recognised best practice. 
Key Elements of Socio- Economic Regeneration Strategies.
 The partners of SURE network have come together to support each other in the development of socioeconomic strategies for the regeneration of declining neighbourhoods. Therefore the SURE represents an attempt to develop strategic frameworks to implement the aims of the Acquis Urban in specific neighbourhoods of medium sized towns and cities. As the development of area based socio- economic strategies can focus on a wide range of factors and approaches there was a need to focus on a small number of specific topics. There are five key topics around which specific interests if the SURE partners revolve. These include: Economic development, Employment, Community development,  Housing, and, Public spaces and facilities. 
Economic development. 
The scale of the current financial and economic crisis has a profound effect on most European countries and many cities within them. In its recent strategy Europe 2020 the European Commission has set out the priorities for the economic recovery which include a focus on jobs, innovation, education, poverty and climate change. The problems identified in the 2020 strategy are now new in nature but unprecedented in their scale and may have significant implications for the regeneration of towns and cities. Many analysts suggest that a number of cities may struggle to remain financially viable and that many capital schemes are likely to be put on hold. This would result in a reduction in private investment to bring about large scale regeneration schemes and a tendency to rely primarily on public sector led investment. Although the realisation of high profile regeneration flagship projects, such as sports stadia, exhibition centres or retail developments, are unlikely targets for the cities participating in the SURE network, the current economic situation also reduces the probability of private sector investment in smaller construction, tourism and other consumption oriented developments (for further discussion see the article by Paul Soto in the URBACT ‘Hot Topics’ series) It is therefore likely that more attention will need to be given to small scale economic development initiatives which build on local skills, opportunities and capacity. Local and regional economic development has a long tradition in many European cities and much support is available through EU policy and EU funding (on a discussion of the URBACT Creative Clusters project see the article by Paul Soto and Miguel Rivas). While each member state approaches local economic development according to its particular historical and institutional context, a shared characteristic of effective local economic development strategies is that they are based on cross-institutional and cross-sectoral partnerships. They typically involve the development of business sites, financial incentives and local capacity building initiatives. Capacity building tends to be targeted at businesses to support innovation and management as well as the local population to help with business start-ups, education and training. 
The Social Economy. 
The social economy is a further aspect which requires attention in the development of socioeconomic regeneration strategies. Ideas about the importance of the social economy are already embedded in the EU Structural Funds and employment guidelines and have formed an integral part of the EU employment policy since the Amsterdam Treaty. Among the numerous measures to improve employability, flexibility, adaptability and entrepreneurship, the guidelines recognise the importance of the social economy for the creation of jobs. The guideline for the Structural Funds emphasise the role of the social economy and suggest that member states should: “investigate measures to exploit fully the possibilities offered by job creation at local level in the social economy and in new activities linked to needs not satisfied by the market, and examine, with the aim of reducing, any obstacles in the way of such measures.”  However, there are many challenges and dilemmas that need to be tackled in harnessing the potential energies and contributions from the local population, particularly with regard to their involvement in strategic regeneration initiatives. One of the common mistakes made by regeneration partnerships is to establish barriers to the engagement with the local social economy by using narrow definitions to create a ‘fit’ between social economy, the market and the public sector. It needs to be borne in mind that the social economy encompasses social enterprise as well as important nonmonetary exchanges between citizens. The latter can have substantial social and economic value, particularly among deprived communities living on the margins of mainstream society in our towns and cities. One of the reasons why there is a renewed interest in social enterprises, and the social economy in general, is that these forms of economic activity are considered to be closer to the ‘grass roots’ of local communities. This implies that disadvantaged people, for example young people with limited formal qualification, might find it easier to access meaningful employment either as a paid or unpaid worker. However, one needs to guard against romantic visions of a local economy for local people. In most cases social enterprises and other non-profit organisations rely on highly qualified and highly committed staff to do their work and attempts to develop micro businesses in the local social economy will need to take this into account. 
Horizontal and Vertical Integration. 
Linking area based regeneration with local economic development strategies can be problematic for a number of reasons. The most common problem is the vertical and horizontal integration of area based initiatives. While area based interventions tend to focus on establishing locally relevant links through partnerships, which create a strong horizontal type of integration, economic development tends to take into account the whole city and its wider context. Making sure that there are effective vertical connections, which link area based activity to wider strategies and policy processes at city, regional and national levels, is often difficult and limits the scope and effectiveness of area based interventions (for further discussion see the article by Ivan Tosics in the URBACT ‘Hot Topic’ series). A related issue is that of support for small and medium sized businesses (SMEs). Support mechanisms for SMEs need to be highly localised and responsive, but in many cases investment decisions for support measures are taken at regional or national levels. This is particularly the case with regard to the utilisation of EU funding (for further details see the summary of the FIN-URBACT network). Hence it is essential to secure the active and early participation on Managing Authorities to combine the vertical integration of area based strategies with local determination of how support measures are financed.
Conclusion and guiding principles.  
The key challenge in urban regeneration is that  every town and every neighbourhood is different.  Municipalities therefore have to develop their own  approaches towards the social and economic  regeneration of town centres and specific  neighbourhoods around them.  This means that for each target area  chosen by the members of the SURE  network, partnerships need to be  established which are able to cut  across departments, agencies and  sectors.  The professional input from a range of public service  sectors is required, including planning, housing,  health, social care, education, transport, grounds  maintenance, refuse collection and policing. In addition, developers, public agencies, community  groups and planners need to find ways of working  closely together.  Furthermore, financial and nonfinancial  resources are required from  public and private agencies, local  citizens and third sector organisations  to generate and then deliver integrated  socio-economic regeneration  strategies.  While some SURE partners are well on the way to having the required competencies for the  development of integrated socio-economic  regeneration strategies, most have much to learn by  way of creating cross-cutting interventions that add  value and contribute towards sustainable growth.  The SURE network provides a valuable space for learning and exchange among practitioners in  search of better solutions to their local problems.    
THEMATIC STRUCTURE AND WORK PLAN. 
Identifying interests and needs. 
Each partner of the SURE network brings a particular combination of expertise, learning needs and interests to the project. Identifying these different dimensions of the partnership was central to the work undertaken during the development phase. This was done in a number of stages, starting with the kick-off meeting, followed by questionnaires, city visits and the development of city profiles. The final stage of analysis involved a number of exercises in which partners were asked to identify shared interests in relation to other partner cities as well as the main themes of the SURE network. During the kick-off meeting on the 18th and 19th January 2010 representatives of partner cities were asked to identify the key topics they would like to explore through the SURE project. This was done through a process of small group discussion in which each partner explained to others why their city wanted to participate in the SURE project, followed by clustering post-it’s around key themes. The results showed that there was a strong coherence of interest around the main themes of the SURE network, namely economic development, employment, housing and public spaces and facilities. However, the exercise also showed that there were a wide range of specific sub-sets of topics which partners wanted to explore. A strong sub-theme was tourism which emerged in relation to the main topics of economic development and employment. The second step involved the analysis of questionnaires supplied by partner cities (Appendix II). The key issues arising from the questionnaires provided the framework for discussion and data collection during a site visit by the Lead Expert. Each site visit lasted between 6 and 8 hours and typically involved a visit to the target area, meetings with residents, traders and political representatives as well as in depth discussions about the nature of the problems faced in the target area and how these related to the wider context of the town. The outcomes of the city visit were drawn together in the city profiles contained in Chapter 3 of this report. These profiles identify the socio-economic context in which the target area is embedded, the opportunities and challenges the target area faces and the particular problems and issues the Local Support Group intend to tackle during the implementation stage of the SURE project. In a third step of analysis partners were asked to provide further detail on specific topics they would like to explore which led to the development of ‘thematic clusters’ partners are likely to participate in. This step was intended to be undertaken through a number of inter-active group exercises during the second transnational workshop scheduled for the 19th and 20th April in Ireland. Unfortunately this workshop had to be cancelled at very short notice due to the flight restrictions which came into force as response to the levels of volcanic ash in the air. Hence these data were collected through two questionnaires (Appendix III). The final step consisted of agreeing the format and focus of study visits with SURE partners. This chapter closes with details of the timings as well as the structure of study visits and transnational workshops. 
Thematic focus of the SURE Network. 
The analysis of the data collected during the second and third step of the process identified where the thematic emphasis of the SURE network should be (Appendix IV). This resulted in a sharper focus on particular themes and topics which now form the organising structure of the SURE network. The main themes of economic development, employment, housing and public spaces and facilities remain as the broad conceptual framework for the SURE network, but they will be addressed under the thematic headings of tourism, enterprise and physical improvements. Equally, broad topics around partnership working and governance have been turned into network specific themes concerned with strategy and community.  Hence the five thematic focal points for the SURE network are: Tourism, Enterprise, Physical improvements, Strategy, and, Community. 
Tourism. 
All except one partner expressed a strong interest in exploring how tourism could be used to support the economic development of their towns. Most partners were already working on some form of development related to the tourist industry and the SURE project was seen to offer a valuable opportunity for exchange and mutual learning. In particular partner cities were interested to learn more about the development of marketing strategies and touristic packages. Creating high quality support services, such as retail, catering, hotel and transport and how to promote local crafts and cultures were also considered to be important topics. In addition partners are interested in learning more about partnership working in the context of the tourism industry. 
Enterprise.
 Every partner expressed a strong interest in learning more about how the development of local enterprises can be encouraged. Support for business start-up, in particular social enterprise, creating synergies and diversifying the business base were key topics all partners want to explore in more detail. Equally important were topics related to the development of entrepreneurial skills and vocational training of the labour force, especially in relation to ethnic minorities and young people. Physical improvements.
 Almost all partners are concerned with finding ways of improving the physical fabric of their SURE target areas and the town centres they relate two. Six partners share a particular interest in housing refurbishments and facelifts to facades of historically valuable buildings. The management of traffic and pedestrian circulation in town centres, together with the creation of attractive open spaces are issues most partners want to find out more about. 
Strategy.
 Almost all partners were interested in developing their strategic capacity to bring about integrated regeneration strategies. This includes partnership working and the development of strategic planning and policy tools. How to manage and re-activate housing markets is of interest to many partners as are strategic approaches to the re-use of buildings and land. A number of partners are also specifically interested in strategies concerned with the management of town centres. 
Community. 
Most partners identified a need to learn more about how to reach and support people living in the SURE target areas. Exploring effective ways of working with young as well as older people was a priority for some partners, while others were more concerned with tackling prejudice, raising awareness and working with ethnic minorities and migrant communities. Developing confidence and self esteem among deprived communities was a further priority, together with finding ways of providing land or facilities for deprived communities. A small number of partners suggested additional interests. These include guidance on how best to attract and manage EU funding and how to go about re-locating public service agencies in deprived neighbourhoods. These and other additional issues that may arise during the implementation phase will be explored in ways which are complementary to the main work programme of the SURE network.

"Sustainable Food in Urban Communities. 
Developing low-carbon and resource-efficient urban food systems. 
FOREWORD. 
This state of the art paper intends to gather selected elements of existing knowledge, research and policy about sustainable food in European urban communities. It also refers to internationally relevant examples. The conceptual framework relies on the analysis of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and European Commission studies especially by the Standing Committee on Agricultural Research. This paper is divided in three parts: Global context and main issues of sustainable food in urban communities. Food system stakeholders and policies. Challenges for communities: spatial and human dynamics of food. 
INTRODUCTION.
 It seems that there is no official definition of “sustainable food”. One of the more frequently encountered could be from the British Sustainable Development Commission (2005) that considers food and drink sustainable if it:  “Is safe, healthy and nutritious, for consumers in shops, restaurants, schools, hospitals…  Can meet the needs of the less well-off people.  Provides a viable livelihood for farmers, processors and retailers, whose employees enjoy a safe and hygienic working environment whether nationally or abroad.  Respects biophysical and environmental limits in its production and processing, while reducing, energy consumption and improving the wider environment; respects the highest standards of animal health and welfare, compatible with the production of affordable food for all sectors of society.  Supports rural economies and the diversity of rural culture, in particular through an emphasis on local products that keep food miles to a minimum”. Another definition by the Sustainable Food Lab1 permits to encompass all actors involved in food system: “We define a sustainable food system as one that realizes its purpose of guaranteeing a right to food and respects food sovereignty, that makes sufficient and healthy food available for all at an affordable price, that reflects all productions costs and internalizes external environmental and social costs and benefits in end prices, that uses resources (including natural resources such as soil and water, as well as human resources such as labour) at their rate of recovery and that respects different aspects of the food-culture. All actors of the food chain and governments should contribute to achieve this sustainable food system.” The purpose of this paper is to describe and analyse the scope od sustainable food for cities that question the food system in their territory. The first part will present the global context: how the occidental food system is challenged by new environmental issues and what the actual effects or events in cities are. The second part introduces the large field of stakeholders and their roles. The third focuses especially on cities’ actions and initiatives: how cities can promote sustainable food all along the local food chain by supporting urban and peri-urban agriculture, local organic quality food distribution channels, and a shift in eating practices of their population. 
Synthesis of the state of the art. 
European context for ‘Food sustainable Consumption and Production’. 
The European Commission is about to propose a communication on sustainable food (2013) in order to make the entire food supply chain more sustainable and follow up on the resource-efficiency roadmap (2011). Core stakeholders have already been involved in a “European Food sustainable Consumption and Production round table” to take a harmonised, life cycle approach and facilitate an open and results-driven dialogue among all players along the food chain (www.food-scp.eu). At present, food represents 30% of the global greenhouse gas emissions from its way of production to the final waste. To address environmental issues, it is all the entire food supply chain that needs to change: from the large amount of resources needed by the growing process (petrol, fertilizer, water…) of crops and livestock to the huge waste of food. About 50% of total food produced go to the waste disposal. Households, retailers, caterers and consumers are responsible for the wastage and it seems that consumers have never been so unaware of food value. Almost a century ago, there was a dreadful fear of famines while nowadays edible food is thrown away. Food waste has to be landfilled or incinerated at very high costs. Waste treatment also leads to greenhouses gas emissions. This expendable resource approach will not fit a situation where resources are constrained. The 3rd Standing Committee on Agricultural Research (SCAR) Foresight Exercise (February 2011) showed how difficult it will be to fulfil all needs in the low carbon society to come. European citizens will have to find ways to change both production and consumption patterns. This core report mentions the fact that many European people are no longer aware of how and where food is grown. Indeed, 73% of European people live in cities quite far from production realities even if geographically close. Many children have never seen a farm and think that food only comes from the supermarket. In its path towards independence and food security, modern society has forgotten to keep a link with reality: food is a condition for life and not only a lifestyle. The other main incentive to focus on the food supply chain is the present awareness about the food industry’s autonomy. Even if Europe is a main food world producer, the process is in the hands of the food industry and the private sector at an international level. Confronted by shocks linked to price volatility or peak oil, how will nations feed their people? How could city authorities react to such events? Indeed there is a need to question “food” as a political subject for all levels of public authorities. 
What could be a local food policy towards a resilient local food system? 
When FAO mentions ‘food security’, it no longer focuses only on cities in developing countries but also in developed countries. The city of New York was primarily involved in food policy in response to obesity increasing rate and health conditions. It has now developed a whole strategy to understand how food is managed in the city. San Francisco and Barcelona have also a kind of traditional food policy and created a food strategy for urban planning through green belt preservation. Indeed, cities have many reasons to focus on the food topic, notably because they have to deal with the food supply chain consequences such as unhealthy consumption that harm public health. They are concerned with the amount of food waste to collect and treat, food education in school canteens, food miles and greenhouse gas emissions on their territory... But the most relevant reason could be to maintain some independency or sovereignty about food. According to the FAO, it could be impossible to ensure food security without the food industry’s intervention and supermarket delivery systems. Nevertheless, recreating local food supply chains could have benefits to answer some main issues about sustainable development: reconnection between consumers and producers that enhances a possibility to revalue food production and reduce waste, reallocation of abandoned lands for agricultural activities, development of new businesses around food… Such ambitions need to rely on solid tools to help cities organise the creation of a global vision of the local food system. 
New concept and tools for a local food policy. 
Some tools already exist that demonstrate a global view of a food system at a city scale. The concept of urban rural continuum developed by the FAO insists on the current disconnection between rural spaces and spaces. This disconnection is not only a geographical issue (transport links are quite efficient to ensure connections) but also a symbolic one. Traditional links between cities and the countryside used to rely on a form of good dependence: the country side brought foodstuffs and cities were places to exchange or find some specific products. With the increase of intermediaries in the food system, farmers sell the major part of their production to companies from the food industry and no longer to consumers directly in town. The products can travel long distances for food processing to sometimes return very near to their original started point. This long road travelled is expensive in transports costs but also creates GHG emissions. The presence of supermarkets in towns as well as in the country side have disorganised the relationship between country side and city. The FAO calls for a new linkage between them. An effective urban rural continuum could partly solve the question of dependency and reduce in a major way environmental impacts of the food chain. This could be a first step towards local food resilience. With this objective in mind, Veil lab from Melbourne in Australia has developed a global tool called “Food Sensitive Urban Planning”. This new approach allows considering urban spaces starting from food issues. How to create agricultural spaces in towns or in periurban areas? How to deliver food fairly and properly to consumers? How to create spaces to enjoy food in a convivial way and give people good living conditions? Those questions find answers with the help of urban planners, sociologists, architects… The mix of views is particularly adapted to address the transversal food issue. Nearly each Department of a city authority could be involved in re-thinking a new local food system. 
Synthesis of the city profiles, converging points, expectations and contributions. 
Visits of an average of one and half day have been organized to the 10 partner cities. A specific questionnaire was sent in advance to each city coordinator and returned to the Lead expert in order to prepare and make most of the visit. A program of the visit was also agreed upon in advance to make most of the time available in the city. In particular the program focused on site visits (eight to ten cases emblematic of sustainable food in an urban context), an initial meeting of the forming Local Support Group and a meeting with public authorities responsible for the engagement of the city in the URBACT project. Lunch and dinner times were often used as an opportunity to visit specific food-related cases and meet more stakeholders informally. Some cities spontaneously leveraged on the initial visit of the Lead expert to communicate their new involvement in the URBACT Thematic Network through internal media (municipality website and newsletters) and to the local press (4 articles published in local newspapers and 2 interviews of Lead expert by local TV). In short, the ten visits allowed building a first catalogue of 98 cases of best practices of sustainable food in an urban context (a light exhibition of the best practices case was made by the city partners during the first enlarged network meeting at the end of the Preparation Phase in Bristol). Site visits, informal interviews and presentations during Local Support Group meetings allowed the Lead expert to engage in more than 250 different face-to-face discussions with local stakeholders involved in sustainable food and build a good understanding of the current developments of the topic in the 10 cities. 
A varied panorama of cities and populations… 
The network offers a good coverage of varied situations regarding the involvement of cities towards a more sustainable local food system on the one hand and the engagement of the urban communities in achieving this system on the other hand. Territorial contexts… The partner cities are distributed from extreme West to extreme East of the European territory. They also cover latitudes from South in Italy, Greece, Rumania and Spain till Nordic part of Europe with large difference in climate influence of agriculture. They range from medium size cities with a population between 70 000 to 250 000 including Vaslui in the East of Rumania, Ourense in Galicia region of Spain, Amersfoort in the periphery of Amsterdam in the Netherlands and Messina right on the strait between Sicilia and Italy. Then come a group of medium-large cities with population ranging from 400 000 to 1 100 000 including Bristol in the West of UK, Gothenburg on the Sweden Baltic coast, Oslo in the South of Norway, Athens, the capital city of Greece, Brussels-Capital Region in Belgium and Lyon in the centre-East of France. Beyond the size and demography the nature of urban fabrics of the partners cities and the regional context in which they are inserted plays an important role in our subject. Athens or Lyon are a very dense and mineral city whereas cities like Oslo, Gothenburg or Brussels present a more loose urban fabric leaving more opportunities for food production at periphery. The direct peri-urban areas may be characterized by a very populated urban sprawl especially for the biggest cities like Lyon, Athens, Brussels or Amersfoort in comparison with very rural outskirts like for Ourense, Vaslui or Messina. Finally the regional context is well-known for having a rich agriculture like Galicia for Ourense or Rhone-Alpe for Lyon in comparison with Attika region around Athens or with the regions around Oslo or Gothenburg. It is to be noted also that some of the cities are important port with a fishing tradition influencing the diet in Messina, Gothenburg, Oslo, Athens and till certain extend Bristol and Ourense when Lyon, Vaslui and Brussels are based in the hinterland. Food cultures… Beyond the territory and land context, a striking difference emerges in the food culture resulting in large disparity in terms of resilience, environmental impact and CO2 emissions relating to food in the different partner cities. Italy, Greece France and Spain are world-known for their respective gastronomies: Messina, Athens, Lyon and also Ourense demonstrate what has been spontaneously called by the other cities of the network a strong food culture. Whereas countries like Norway, UK or Netherlands suffer from a weaker food culture that dissolved quickly into the push of low-quality food brought by modern agro-industry. The challenge for Oslo, Bristol or Amersfoort belonging to the latter group is to recover from this situation and the topic of sustainable food is seen as an opportunity to build or rebuild a food culture. For Messina, Athens and till a certain extend Lyon, Ourense and Vaslui, the challenge is opposite: they still have a strong food capital and they strive to avoid its on-going erosion. Sustainable food is then seen as a leapfrogging opportunity to pass from a still vibrant traditional food culture to a sustainable one without passing to an intermediate stage of industrial consumption. The posture of the population in front of food reflects this polarization: cities with strong food culture demonstrate a population that is strongly rooted and engaged with food. This traditional and diffused engagement is robust but signs of erosion are clearly visible in particular in the food habits of the new generations in Messina, Athens, Vaslui and these cities tends to demonstrate a certain blindness to the risk of this evolving situation. The cities lacking of a strong food culture shows generally a very dynamic and colourful communities of food activists. In Amersfoort, Oslo, Bristol, Gothenburg and also Brussels and Lyon that shows both patterns, food activists multiply initiatives from urban gardening to food festivals. These so-called 'foodies' represents a minority. They often high visibility tends to hide a mainstream population rather disengaged with food and not necessarily sensitive to the food community arena.
 A general reclaiming food movement… 
Despites the rich variety in territorial and cultural differences described above, the network of cities shows strong elements of convergence for what regards the theme of sustainable food for urban communities. Food resilience as an issue. First of all the theme appears clearly as an issue for all the participating cities and a deep concern to reach a more resource and carbon efficient food system. Some as Bristol, Brussels, Amersfoort or Lyon, Gothenburg or Oslo have already demonstrated interest at both citizens and political levels. But also for newcomers, joining this URBACT Thematic Network appears as an opportunity catalysing a mix of latent requests ranging from defending traditional gastronomy, reducing food-related health diseases to increasing city resilience or reducing its carbon footprint. Crisis as threat and opportunity. The generalised economic crisis generates precariousness in access to food for an increasing number of families across the cities of the network. This is blatantly obvious in cities hit by the crisis like Athens, high unemployment rates as in Ourense or Messina or among a significant part of the population living in poverty like Bristol or Brussels. Other factors such as fast population growth also affect richer cities like Oslo. Sustainable food then seems an even less attainable goal and a low political priority when even cheaper low quality industrial food becomes difficult to afford for underprivileged population groups. The reality of food poverty is clearly highly sensitive but the cities of the network also see some opportunities that are linked to any crisis. Transition towards sustainable food reveals many synergies with the revitalisation of the socioeconomic fabric. Cases in Bristol such as the “Feeding Bristol” local community growing project or reengagement in cooking activities supported by the “Hartcliffe Health & Environment Action Group” provide direct benefits in kind to the families with decreasing purchasing power. Labour intensive food production activities especially in urban contexts present for Brussels, Ourense or Athens a potential of job opportunities and the emergence of new entrepreneurship. Creative activism and resisting traditions. A 'reclaiming food' bottom-up movement is strongly emerging opposed to previous decades where food was perceived in terms of service, convenience, innovation and modernity. According to food cultural background describe above, this diffuse reclaiming food requests assume different forms: a creative activism reconnecting with self-growing food, cooking skills, social or symbolic values of eating together and innovating in new forms of delivering, cutting intermediaries, inventing short food networks. At the opposite, we can see in cities with strong food culture forms of resistance to preserve tradition, an attachment to original culinary principles and a diffuse resistance to any changes including towards sustainable concerns. Transversal push. Another characteristics of the reclaiming food trend is its transversal aspect: it pools together all what is relating to food in each cities mixing often initiatives born with very different motivations. Urban gardening for instance may start as an activity facilitating social inclusion of marginalised population. It may also originate as an art project, an educational initiative, a pretext for socialisation, a production enterprises or a simple recreational hobby. Those different motivations tend to blur and most gardening initiatives are multipurpose. The resulting aggregations made by the transversal nature of the network theme increase the number of initiatives to be found in a determinate city but often bring together heterogeneous initiatives difficult to handle with same supporting policies. Leveraging on food attractiveness. The population engagement process into sustainable food tends to be based on similar strategies building on this reclaiming food movement and leveraging on engaging dimension of food: quality, tastes, gastronomy, socialisation, pleasure… This indirect strategy is working quite well: Initiatives of from community gardening to food festivals and from farmer seasonal markets to cooking schools tends to pop-up everywhere. It raises interest in food first in order to focus on sustainability. The limit of this strategy is that many initiatives reach an involvement in food but not necessarily in sustainable food. In other words, many promising food initiatives as listed before may also stay happy and enthusiastic moments of socialisation and gastronomy events that hardly influences the population food practices and in particular, the reduction of its environmental impacts. Up-scaling niches. The last common aspect to be underlined is that most of the initiatives considered in the different cities are at a niche stage and strive to upscale. Promising solutions emerged both in terms of sustainable food and of potential new business models. The challenge is now to screen the most promising ones, generate viable enterprises, bring them to a regime level in order to both provide sustainable food to larger share of the urban population and to generate employment opportunities. 
Screening promising initiatives… 
Partner cities show a panorama of initiatives ranging from micro-actions to more structural projects or policy changes. The most colourful and visible ones such as food-art happenings or large popular food-oriented gatherings are not necessarily significant in terms of local transition towards sustainable food. Reciprocally, important on-going transformations based on sustainable procurement in school canteens or redynamisation of a market gardening city-belt may have less visibility and raise less popular attractiveness but have greater impact at the end. Estimate social involvement. Most of the initiatives considered have a systemic nature: a community garden generally combines multiple direct effects (i.e. diffusing growing skills among the population; sample production of vegetables…) and generates indirect effects (i.e. reconnection with the use of fresh ingredients; revitalisation of the neighbourhood life…). It is therefore difficult to estimate the importance of each single initiative for the multiplication factor of combined direct and indirect effects. Some of the visited project introduced spontaneously a simple assessment scale trying to estimate how many people are touched by the initiative. GHG emissions and resource efficiency. Initiatives promoting food witnessed in the different cities have a great value to reengage the population with food and this is already very important to generate an interest in food prior to introduce sustainability concerns on the one hand. On the other hand and as already mentioned earlier in the text, a reengagement in food is necessary but not sufficient to ensure that focused initiatives are promising in terms of sustainability. Reduction of GHG emission and improvement of resource efficiency has to be considered for each of the emerging solutions to be part of the new local food system in each city. Progresses on sustainability indicators are necessary across the network in order to classify best practices in terms of sustainable food, give priority on the most promising one and reorient the others. For instance, in Brussels half of the meals taken in canteens are provided by the private catering company Sodexo. In response to Brussels Environment’s will to improve environmental performances, the company is fine-tuning an eco-calculator that indicates the meal’s carbon footprint. 
Governance of the local sustainable food system. 
Partner cities welcome the topic of sustainable food recognising it is a critical issue in future urban contexts. The transversal nature of this subject is challenging most of the municipalities' infrastructures. Food was dealt with before at higher national or regional levels. Its approach at city levels tends to pool together sectors that did not particularly interact before. Lyon and Gothenburg in particular underlined how the sustainable food topics requires bringing together land use issues with the department of urban planning and the department in charge of parks and gardens, environmental impact assessment with the department of environment, low incomes, population mitigation and department dealing with social inclusion, entrepreneurship and job creation and the department of economics etc. Generating synergies. The 'reclaiming food' movement generates many and heterogeneous initiatives, often isolated one from another and developing informally without any overall strategy. The challenge for the partner cities is then to keep the momentum, to create links between these initiatives. Such micro-projects may stay independent niches if they do not synergize. Isolated food-related initiatives can be compared to acupuncture needles stimulating specific points of the territory. If well chosen so that they link together, cross-fertilize and reinforce each other, these points may generate a systemic effect that go beyond a series of localised benefits - a systemic transformative effect on the territory and generate the emergence of a local food system. Governance postures. The postures adopted by the municipalities in the different partner cities in order to stimulate and generate these systems of food initiatives show also very important differences. In most of the cases public authorities consider they should initiate and lead public participation. In Athens for instance, the Eleonas’ urban farm is born as a top-down project decided at a political level that is subsequently seeking engagement of the local population to take part to growing activities. Ourense also shows a strong development policy involving 10 surrounding villages in a collaborative market gardening project. Afterwards, municipalities tend to monitor and control the projects they initiated as in the case of Lyon that achieved the stage of 30 community gardens and decided to slow down new creation in order to monitor as in an incubator if the community gardens evolve towards a financial and management autonomy. Bristol tends to adopt a more loose posture watching the many food initiatives emerging in the city, comparing the social entrepreneurship business model behind them and their capabilities to grow and disseminate autonomously and with less public or private subsidies in this period of budgetary shortage. At the opposite extreme from Athens, Amersfoort shows a situation where the lead is left in the hands of the local food community and the public administration is adopting essentially a back-up governance posture especially removing barriers – mainly on legislative issues – that prevent the grassroots movements to develop. Platforms and experimentations. Beyond this main polarisation between top-down initiatives driven by public administration and bottom-up movements where the public administration adopts a back-up posture, some cities show specific and innovative governance features. Bristol established an informal policy platform: the Bristol Food Policy Council is not an official administrative body of the municipality but it acts as such. A dozen of representatives of local food stakeholders including small and large businesses, non-profit organisations, academics and public authorities regularly meet, discuss food-related issues and problems and work as a think tank and an advisory panel for local governance. Ourense shows a series of initiatives right in line with current debate on the right of experimentation of public authorities. The main starting initiative of the municipality is an articulated project involving stimulation of market gardening in surrounding villages combined with a direct delivery scheme and the refurbishment of the historical central market. The whole project works as a small-scale experimentation testing both different relatively independent initiatives and their integration through a strategy brought by the municipality. 
Resulting themes and crosscutting issues. 
The URBACT Thematic Network “Sustainable food for urban communities”, composed by 10 European cities intends to show how cities can create a coherent food policy that would take into account environmental, social and economic issues at their level of action. 
Organization in 3 themes.
In line with the concept of rural-urban continuum presented in the State of the Art, three themes have been selected to organize the multiple vibrant and heterogeneous initiatives of cities along a local sustainable food supply chain: “Growing”, “Delivering” and “Enjoying”. These themes have strong links with each other and are related with the capacity to act and with the various competences of the cities and partners. This generic focus allows the creation of a framework in which every city can express its own strategy. 
Growing. The theme of Growing explores all possible ways to grow food near or in the city. It includes: fostering sustainable agricultural growth in urban and periurban areas thanks to urban planning strategies; the use of derelict lands; safeguarding and improving the fertility of lands; developing new technologies that do not need so much land to grow; encouraging decentralised individual, community and commercial fruit and vegetable gardens & food production; encouraging households and citizen ’organisations' to grow food in the city, in gardens, in parks, on public and private green spaces, on rooftops, on balconies… 
Delivering. The theme of Delivering explores ways to distribute, share and procure local food inside the city. It includes more sustainable and less carbon intensive delivery systems giving efficient opportunities to local production; enabling direct links between supply and demand for sustainable food; facilitating the transition of existing distribution market actors towards greater sustainability and lower carbon intensity; stimulating the emergence of new ones (e.g. food businesses, retail...) and other local initiatives (e.g. markets, purchasing groups, networks, transparency in food chain...) 
Enjoying. The theme of Enjoying explores how people in the city can embrace a sustainable, happy, healthy and vibrant food culture in canteens and households. It includes increasing the demand for sustainable food (e.g. local products, without pesticides, seasonal and fresh products…) and encouraging sustainable practices (e.g. food storage, preparation, avoiding waste...) by supporting changes in perceptions, attitudes and behaviours of canteens and final consumers and by involving urban consumer groups not previously reached or aware and adapting the approaches to their specificities (e.g. low-income households, single person households, different food cultures, young families lacking cooking skills...). 
Crosscutting issues. 
The transversal overview of the main lessons learned during the visits of the 10 partner cities reveals 4 main recurrent concerns that will be put forward as 4 key crosscutting questions. They will systematically be considered in the network’s discussions and deliverables for each theme: Synergies, governance & local system: How can we link multiple promising food practices, develop synergies, increase resilience and generate the vision of a coherent local food system? Jobs & business models: How can we consolidate promising food practices, transform them into sustainable businesses and upscale sustainable food initiatives to reach a larger share of the population? CO2 & resources efficiency: How can we check and improve promising food practices in order to reduce emissions and impact on resources and energy? Social inclusion: How can we leverage on sustainable food transition to reduce food poverty, foster (re)engagement with growing and cooking food, support inclusion of marginalised and underprivileged population groups and enhance cohesion between communities?

"INTRODUCTION
 This is the Baseline Study for the Arrival Cities network. Arrival Cities is an action planning network within the URBACT III pogramme. URBACT is a European exchange and learning programme supporting sustainable urban development. The URBACT programme helps cities to develop pragmatic solutions to common policy challenges by working together. The Arrival Cities network is focused on the challenge of managing global migration flows at a local level. The Arrival Cities network is led by the Municipality of Amadora in Portugal. Amadora’s partner cities in the network are: Thessaloniki, Greece ; Riga, Latvia ; Messina, Italy; Roquetas de Mar, Spain ; Vantaa, Finland ; Dresden, Germany ; Val-de-Marne, France ; Oldenburg, Germany ; Patras, Greece. Migration is a fundamental feature of human society. Throughout human history people have migrated from place to place, in pursuit of new opportunities or in flight from danger or hardship. In the modern age, the globalisation of trade, travel and communications have created new dynamics in international migration. Although global migration rates have remained relatively stable for many decades, the subject has grown into one of the most emotive and controversial of contemporary society. Recent events have propelled migration to the very top of the European political agenda. Current migration issues are complex and multi-faceted. They include the growing crisis of refugees seeking safety in Europe, the impacts of this on the frontline regions in Greece, Italy and Spain, and the political fall out from attempts to agree a common and humanitarian EU response to refugee arrivals. Other priorities within current migration issues include: the expressed resentment of some communities towards incoming migrants, reflected in the electoral success of anti-immigration parties in almost all EU member states; the emergence of religious extremism with real or putative associations to acts of terrorism, including the devastating attacks recently seen in Paris; and in concerns about young people who are leaving their EU homes to join extremist groups fighting in the Syrian conflict. Current migration issues also include the EU’s challenge of balancing public, political and media hostility towards further migration with the need to attract migrant workers to sustain the workforce of Europe’s rapidly ageing population. Together, the Arrival Cities partners will be working within the URBACT methodological framework of learning and exchange to improve their local capacity to deal with these global challenges. The Arrival Cities network was established in mid-2015 and will be operational through the two phases of the URBACT Action Planning Network programme. Phase One, the development phase, took place from September 2015 to March 2016. Phase Two, the learning and exchange phase, will take place from May 2016 to May 2018.  

1.1 Introduction
This section of the Baseline Study sets out the ‘state of the art’ on global migration within the EU context in which the Arrival Cities network will operate. The aim is to provide a common understanding across the network of the key issues, policies, actions and resources for migration and migrant integration across the EU.
1.2 Background information
1.2.1 Definitions
According to UNESCO a ‘migrant’ can be defined as ""any person who lives temporarily or permanently in a country where he or she was not born, and has acquired some significant social ties to this country."" (UNESCO, 2015).
Within the European Union context ‘migrants’ are understood to be “non-EU, or third country nationals who reside legally in the European Union”. (OECD/European Union, 2015)
The main forms of migration are generally distinguished by (a) the motives of the people who are migrating, and (b) their legal status within the country of arrival. The most common categorisations of international migrants include:
Temporary labour migrants (also known as guest workers, contract workers, seasonal workers): people who migrate for a limited period of time in order to take up employment and send money home.
Highly skilled and business migrants: people with high level skills who are often encouraged to migrate to countries where there is a demand for those skills.
Irregular migrants (also known as undocumented or illegal migrants): people who enter a country, usually to seek employment, without the required documents.
Forced migrants: this includes refugees, asylum seekers, trafficked people and others forced to move due to external factors.
Family reunification migrants (also known as family reunion or family members): people who share family ties with people who have already entered an immigration country. All EU countries recognise the right to family reunification for legal migrants.
Return migrants: people who return to their country of origin after a period in another country.
A separate set of definitions are applied to the descendants of settled migrants. These are the people who are born in the host country but who are often perceived as different from the host or majority population, perhaps due to characteristics of their appearance, culture or religion. These populations are variously referred to as:
Second generation migrants;
Immigrant-descendants;
Native born immigrant offspring;
Ethnic, cultural or visible minorities.


The Common Basic Principles for Integration.
CBP1: Integration is a dynamic, two-way process of mutual accommodation by all immigrants and residents of member states.
CBP2: Integration implies respect for the basic values of the European Union.
CBP3: Employment is a key part of the integration process and is central to the participation of immigration, to the contributions immigrants make to the host society, and to making such contributions visible.
CBP4: Basic knowledge of the host society’s language, history and institutions is indispensable to integration; enabling immigrants to acquire this basic knowledge is essential to successful integration.
CBP5: Efforts in education are critical to preparing immigrants, and particularly their descendants, to be more successful and more active participants in society.
CBP6: Access for immigrants to institutions, as well as to public and private goods and services, on a basis equal to national citizens and in a non-discriminatory way is a critical foundation for better integration.
CBP7: Frequent interaction between immigrants and Member State citizens is a fundamental mechanism for integration. Shared forums, inter-cultural dialogue, education about immigrants and immigrant cultures, and stimulating living conditions in urban environments enhance the interactions between immigrants and Member State citizens.
CBP8: The practice of diverse cultures and religions is guaranteed under the Charter of Fundamental Rights and must be safeguarded, unless practices conflict with other inviolable European rights or with national law.
CBP9: The participation of immigrants in the democratic process and in the formulation of integration policies and measures, especially at the local level, support their integration.
CBP10: Mainstreaming integration policies and measures in all relevant policy portfolios and levels of government and public services is an important consideration in public policy formation and implementation.
CBP11: Developing clear goals, indicators and evaluation mechanisms are necessary to adjust policy, evaluate progress on integration and to make the exchange of information more effective.

1.3 Current issues.
1.3.1 European Union policy.
Migration is currently very much at the top of the EU policy agenda. The growing refugee crisis has highlighted some of the weaknesses in the EU’s migration policies, prompting a greater focus on policy and resources directed at common actions to address both the immediate crisis and longer term issues.
Current EU plans are set out in the European Agenda on Migration, adopted in May 2015. The Agenda sets the policy and budgetary framework for actions on migration at European level. These actions are conceived in two main parts: (1) immediate actions in response to the refugee crisis and (2) actions for better management of migration. The immediate actions in the European Agenda on Migration include:
Tackling criminal smuggling networks;
Relocating newly arriving refugees across the member states;
Establishing a resettlement programme for 20,000 people per year across the EU member states;
Measures in countries of origin and transit to prevent people from making hazardous crossings to Europe;
Designating Hotspots for frontline refugee arrivals where EU resources can be swiftly mobilised to manage asylum processing and return of irregular migrants.
The longer term actions for better migration management are conceived within four pillars
Discouraging irregular migration through measures which include addressing the root causes of departure from countries of origin;
Improved border management, including through strengthening the role and capacity of the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union (Frontex);
Agreeing a common EU policy on asylum;
A common policy on legal migration, including measures for effective migrant integration.

1.3.3 Migrant arrival issues
Refugees
Refugees account for a relatively small proportion of all international migrants. In 2013, the total number of refugees in the world was estimated at 15.7 million, representing about 7% of all international migrants. Nearly 90% of the world’s refugees live in developing regions. Europe hosts less than 10% of all global refugees; around 1.5 million people in 2013 (United Nations, 2013).
Throughout 2015, growing numbers of refugees entered Europe, driven by conflict, violence and poverty. Thousands of people from Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and other countries have been seeking safety and opportunities in Europe. The war in Syria has been the greatest cause in the mass movement of people. More than 11 million Syrians have been forced to leave their homes, of which more than 4 million are now refugees in other countries, including over 2 million who are currently living in Turkey (Echo, 2015).
More than one million refugees crossed into Europe in 2015, a huge increase on the 280,000 people estimated to have arrived in 2014. The great majority travelled by sea, crossing from Turkey to Greece and from north Africa to Italy. The migrant sea-crossings into Europe are highly dangerous. It is believed that that more than 3,700 people drowned in 2015 during sea crossings to Europe, the majority (at least 2,800 people) while crossing from Libya to Italy (BBC, 2016). The flow of refugees has continued to increase in early 2016, with at least 82,000 people reaching Europe by sea in January and early February.
From their arrival points in Greece and Italy, refugees have been travelling across Europe to reach Germany and other north European countries. But the transit routes established for these journeys are now being blocked as individual countries seeking to avoid a build up of asylum seekers within their own territory impose tighter border controls. Border closures have created acute crisis points, including at the northern Greek border with Macedonia where at least 7,000 people are currently stranded in freezing conditions without adequate food or shelter. As other European countries have shut off the transit routes, Greece has been left to cope with the growing crisis as refugees continue to arrive but are now unable to travel north.
More than one million people claimed asylum in Europe in 2015. The greatest number of asylum claims were made in Germany (at least 476,000) followed by Hungary (at least 177,100). In relation to population size, Hungary received the highest proportion of asylum claims at nearly 1,800 claims per 100,000 population. The EU average was 255 claims per 100,000 population. There were huge differences between member states.

The influx of refugees has been regarded as a crisis for Europe and has highlighted major political rifts between member states. The Schengen accord has come under considerable strain as individual member states have imposed unilateral border controls to slow down or stop the flow of refugees through their own territory. In response, on 4 March 2016, the European Commission announced a package of measures designed to ‘restore a fully functioning Schengen system’ including more support for Greece to manage the external EU border (European Commission, 2016). In addition, the latest EU response measures to the migrant crisis include a deal with the Turkish government. Under the deal, which is not yet agreed, Turkey will halt refugee departures and accept refugees who will be forcibly returned from EU member states. In return, it is reported that Turkey will receive more than €3 billion and that Turkish citizens will be able to travel without visas through the Schengen area from mid-2016 (Al Jazeera, 2016). It remains to be seen if this, or other EU measures will provide an effective and humanitarian solution to the refugee crisis.
Unaccompanied minors
Children aged under 18 years old who arrive alone are recognised as the most vulnerable of all refugees and migrants. More than 24,000 unaccompanied children from third countries claimed asylum in the EU in 2014, representing around 4% of all asylum applications. The number of unaccompanied children who arrive in the EU and do not seek asylum is unknown, but is believed to have been more than 8,500 in 2013 (European Migration Network, 2015). The international aid agency Save the Children reports that at least 26,000 unaccompanied children arrived in Europe in 2015 (The Observer, 2016). As the scale of the current refugee crisis escalates, there are growing concerns for the safety of unaccompanied children tavelling through Europe and for those who are trapped in makeshift camps at closed borders, prevented from travelling on to reach relatives in other countries. The EU criminal intelligence agency, Europol, reports that at least 10,000 unaccompanied refugee children have disappeared since arriving in Europe. It is feared that many have been taken by criminal gangs (The Observer, 2016).

Trafficking.
More than 30,000 cases of people being trafficked into the EU were recorded between 2012 and 2016. Among trafficking victims, 80% are women and almost 70% are trafficked for sexual exploitation purposes (European Commission, 2014).

1.3.4 Migrant integration issues
The main challenges for integration of non-EU migrants are generally considered to fall within the areas of labour market, education and social inclusion.
Key labour market issues are lower employment, higher unemployment and higher over-qualification rates for non-EU migrants:
The employment rate for non- EU migrants fell by 6 percentage points from 2008 to 57% in 2014, compared with the 69% average employment rate across the EU (MIPEX, 2015).
Unemployment rates for non-EU migrants are least double those of EU nationals and up to four times higher in some member states, including Belgium (OECD/European Union, 2015).
The average rate of over-qualification for their job is 44% for non-EU migrants compared with 20% for EU nationals. Over qualification rates for non-EU migrants are 80% in Greece and Italy (OECD/European Union, 2015).
The main education challenge is the significant proportion of migrants who lack basic skills:
Almost 20% of third country migrants aged 25-34 have very low levels of education (no higher than primary schooling), compared with 4% of host country nationals (OECD/European Union, 2015).
Key social inclusion issues are poverty, housing and discrimination:
Non EU migrants within the EU face a higher risk of poverty; 49% are considered at risk of poverty, an increase of four percentage points since 2008. This is twice the level of EU citizens (MIPEX, 2015).
Non-EU migrants live in poorer housing and are three times less likely to own their own homes than host-country nationals (OECD/European Union, 2015).
More than one in four (27%) people from ethnic minority populations report experiencing discrimination (MIPEX, 2015). Perceived discrimination is lowest in the Scandinavian countries and most widespread in Austria and Greece (OECD/European Union, 2015).
1.3.5 Issues for ethnic minority populations
National and regional policies in most EU member states make no distinction between minority and majority populations. One result is that information about the experiences and outcomes for ethnic minority populations within the EU is patchy, as few countries collect or publish data on this. However, there is now considerable evidence which shows that some ethnic minority populations experience social and economic challenges which are similar to, and in some cases worse than, those facing migrant populations.
Issues for ethnic minority populations within the EU include:
Residential segregation. In some cities ethnic minority populations are clustered in distinct geographic locations, often with poor housing and few facilities. However, this pattern is not found in all member states (OECD/European Union, 2015).
Racial discrimination. Young people born in the EU of non-EU migrant parents are more likely to report being discriminated against than young immigrants (OECD/European Union, 2015).
Racist violence. Levels of racist crime are rising across Europe, although the lack of systematic recording makes this difficult to track and compare. Racist crime is most frequently perpetrated against people from Black, Asian and Roma populations and anti-Semitic crimes have increased in some member states. Victims are often unwilling to report racist crime and there are notable levels of non-investigation of racially motivated crimes in some member states (ENAR, 2014).
Poorer education outcomes. Some ethnic minority groups achieve lower educational qualifications within the school system. However, the academic performance of immigrant-descendent children has improved considerably in a small number of OECD countries, notably Germany and Belgium (OECD/European Union, 2015).
Higher unemployment rates. The EU youth unemployment rate for young people with immigrant parents is almost 50% higher than for those with native born parents (OECD/European Union, 2015).
Higher poverty levels. The proportion of young people from migrant backgrounds living in poverty is double that of other young people. (OECD/European Union, 2015)
Radicalisation, particularly among young people, is now emerging as a major issue for some ethnic minority populations. There are growing concerns, particularly in France, about the number of people who are leaving to join militant Islamic groups. Of the 3,000-plus Europeans who are known to have travelled to Syria and Iraq for this purpose, almost half have been French (Henley, 2015). Radicalisation is a very new area of concern where definitions, data and policies are still developing.


1.5 Gaps in current knowledge and practice.
During Phase One of the Arrival Cities network (September 2015 to March 2016), the 10 cities in the Arrival Cities network shared their experiences about how municipalities are currently dealing with migrant arrival and longer term integration. This research identified a series of gaps in current knowledge and practice, which the Arrival Cities network will address in Phase Two. Key gaps are in the following areas : 
Building community cohesion 
The Arrival Cities partners bring a wealth of experience in the design and implementation of community cohesion and inter-cultural cooperation initiatives. Despite the success of previous initiatives in this area, community cohesion continues to present major challenges. Local areas are struggling to manage the tensions of overt public, political and media hostility to new migrant arrivals; to address widespread concerns about the impacts of migration on local jobs and services; and to challenge the media narrative linking young people of migrant origin with radicalisation and potential terrorist threats. For Arrival Cities, the emphasis within the theme will be on promoting effective and sustainable approaches, seeking to build and draw on a stronger evidence base about what works to overcome community tensions and build cohesive communities. Specific areas of focus will be: Developing community cohesion through inter-cultural activities (including sports and cultural activities); Promoting rights, responsibilities and shared values; Challenging negative perceptions of new arrivals; Managing community tensions. 
Improving co-ordination 
The Arrival Cities partners recognise the opportunity to participate in the URBACT programme as a vehicle for improving the local co-ordination of their policies and actions on migration and integration. The URBACT Local Groups bring together key stakeholders for exactly this purpose. The limitations of resources for this policy field, including the often very small number of municipality staff dedicated to this work, mean that improved co-ordination is essential. Influencing and co-ordinating the work of all stakeholders is the only way to achieve effective and sustainable impacts with limited resources. For Arrival Cities, the emphasis here is on joining up services, both within municipalities, and between the municipality and external stakeholders, including the very many ordinary citizens who have stepped in as volunteers to help welcome and support refugees arriving or in transit through the partner cities. Additionally, within this theme, there will be a strong emphasis on building the capacity of migrant communities to play an active role in developing policy, designing and implementing interventions to support migrant integration, ensuring that the migrant communities themselves are active participants and not just passive recipients of work in this field. Specific areas of focus within this theme will be:  Empowering migrant communities to have a stronger voice/play a more active role in policy or service delivery;   Co-ordinating volunteer support for refugee/migrant integration;   Influencing the inclusion of migrant needs in all areas of city council policy and service delivery.   
Economic integration  
There have been many initiatives to support economic integration of migrants, including through training programmes, language classes, employment preparation projects and job brokerage schemes. As a result, there is a considerable body of knowledge within the Arrival Cities network and across the EU about good practice and effective approaches. However, migrant unemployment rates continue to be considerably higher than local averages, including for second and third generation migrant people. For Arrival Cities, the emphasis within this theme should be on early interventions: preventing migrant and migrant background children from falling behind within the school system; helping new arrivals to find jobs or to re-train for jobs in the local labour market; delivering intensive language support to new arrivals to ensure that no one is excluded from social or economic opportunities because they cannot speak the local language. Specific areas of focus within this theme will be:  Preparing new arrivals through education and training;   Engaging employers in the design and delivery of employment support programmes;   Supporting labour market integration in a fragile/collapsed economy.

 TechTown.

 A Digital City Future - Adapt or Die.
1. INTRODUCTION 
1.1. TechTown 
TechTown is an URBACT III Action Planning Network of 11 cities which aims to explore how small and medium sized cities can maximise the job creation potential of the digital economy. During the period from September 2015 to May 2018 it will examine whether there is potential for spillover from stronger city and regional level digital economies, explore the role of the city in growing a digital economy, examine how clusters can work at city level and look collaboratively at what cities can do to support businesses to access the digital skills and innovations they need in order to start, grow and compete. 
More specifically it will focus on the following themes: 
Better understanding the digital economy 
In order to address the questions set out above, and in recognition of the fact that 'if you can't measure it, you can't improve it', TechTown will need to better understand the digital economy and its potential value. Cities will explore together how to do this in such a fast moving context. How can cities identify their digital community? How do others define 'digital jobs' and is it helpful to pin down a precise definition? What tools already exist which can help to measure existing and future growth potential? What new metrics will be needed to measure city interventions? Is there scope to develop a tool for TechTown cities to help with this? 
Growing Digital Jobs 
TechTown will look into how cities can grow digital jobs. This will be covered through the following 4 sub themes: 
Growing new digital jobs through start ups: What can cities do to support digital start ups? How can they better position themselves to optimise the conditions for competitiveness? What sort of business support do digital start ups want and need? How can cities help start ups to survive and to grow? 
Growing jobs through the digital transformation of traditional industry: What can cities do to support digital transformation of traditional industry and existing businesses? What is the role of cluster policy? (How can cities help small family (retail) businesses?) 
Growing digital jobs through the smart city agenda: How can cities ensure that they maximise the local jobs creation potential linked to delivering smart city agendas? How can they avoid larger multinationals reaping all the rewards? What role could local city  challenges, hackathons play? What role could public procurement play? 
Providing spaces and places for connections: How important is it to have a physical space for the digital community? What does this space look like? What is the accompanying 'offer' in terms of business support, incubator or accelerator support? What is the unique position of medium sized cities? 
Finding, growing, retaining and returning talent: How can medium sized cities attract and retain (young) skilled people? How can they position themselves so that people want to live and work there? What can cities do to better match education and training provision with the needs of the digital economy (now and in the future)? How can they avoid losing out to larger regional and national 'hubs'? 
Governance: One cross cutting key issue to be addressed will be the capacity of cities and their stakeholders to rise to the new challenges of the digital economy. Do they have the right skills and attributes to maximise its potential? Are they the best people to do so for the city? Could others do it better? How can they better engage with other stakeholders? What new governance arrangements should be considered? How can cities be as responsive and nimble as the digital economy whilst maintaining resilience? 
The partners will use the learning generated through transnational activities to inform their local actions.
2. STATE OF THE ART. 
2.1. The Digital Economy - an introduction. 
""The digital economy is everywhere; it has transformed and will continue to transform the economy, in terms of productivity and connectivity, especially for SMEs"". (Expert Group on Taxation of the Digital Economy, European Commission, 2013). 
The digital economy is the 'single most important driver of innovation, competitiveness and growth'. 1.5m additional jobs could be created in the EU digital economy if it mirrored the performance of the US. It already contributes around 8% of the GDP in the G-20 economies and yet only 2% of EU businesses are said to be taking full advantage of digital opportunities (European Commission, 2015). 
Recent developments in ICT including the rapid growth of smart devices, social media and the internet-of-things allow for a new type and level of connectedness and digitally mediated interaction between people. New technologies hold massive potential for manufacturing industries, offering potential (good and bad) to transform entire sectors. These new digital trends are not just about technological innovation. They are radically shifting the business landscape, reshaping the world of work, introducing innovations in business models, developing new networking and knowledge transfer mechanisms, reducing the time to market and widening access to international markets. They are also relevant to the management of cities themselves and in the delivery of public services, which benefit the economy, citizens and the environment. 
This section explores the many facets of the digital economy. Drawing on an extensive literature review, it looks at: 
Definitions and characteristics of the digital economy,
Size and growth potential, 
Challenges and barriers, 
Policy responses at international, national and local levels, 
The role of cities. 

The power to connect digital size, scale and outcome lies with businesses, industry sectors and governments. With smarter investments, digital resources, technologies and assets can have a positive influence on competitiveness and help economies and industries drive greater, more sustainable value. (Accenture, 2016 (for World Economic Forum, Davos, January 2016)

2.1.3. The Digital Economy - some challenges and barriers. 
Despite all of this potential, the growth experienced in some countries - particularly the US - is not mirrored in Europe. According to the European Commission businesses that fail to get digitally connected will become excluded from the global market and yet it is estimated that only 2% of European companies are currently taking full advantage of new digital opportunities. 
So what are the challenges and barriers? What is preventing Europe from keeping pace with its global competitors? 
The current skills mismatch is a major barrier to growth. It is vital to better integrate digital skills into education from early years to higher education, through vocational training and lifelong learning. As Herman Van Rompuy said in his article Boosting Digital EuropeDigital Minds, European Digital Forum, 2015), 'Unemployment today is about poor skills, not necessarily about poor education'. As more and more 'traditional' jobs are becoming 'digitalised' in some way, so more and more digital skills - from basic ICT skills to more sophisticated coding or programming skills - are needed. Indeed by 2020 it is estimated that 85-90% of all job vacancies in Europe will require digital skills. 
“Digital natives” may be intimately familiar with digital technologies, but Europe must go further: it needs people across all generations to have digital skills. A deep understanding of coding principles and knowledge of a number of programming languages may well become the most important dialect for Europeans of all ages in the digital era'. 
'Embracing the digital era to ensure Europe's competitiveness' (European Digital Forum, 2015), Klaus Schwab (Founder and Executive Chairman of the World Economic Forum) 
It is ironic that the forces that create a dynamic and entrepreneurial culture are also the ones that create skills shortages, especially as innovation accelerates. 
So, Europe also needs to stimulate a more innovative, risk taking and an entrepreneurial mindset and to accelerate the use of digital technologies across old and new businesses. Unless this happens, digital companies will experience difficulties accessing finance and, as they also have often have low levels of working capital, this affects their resilience and ability to build the relationships they need to break into this complex and competitive international market.
2.2.3. Local level responses. 
The digital economy flourishes in cities, which have a good supply of skilled workers and strong technical and operational infrastructure. 
According to the UK's TechNation report, companies are also more affected by core operational factors (broadband, skills, market opportunity) and lifestyle factors for employees (quality of life, community, personal reasons) than they are by access to finance, support from universities and sector expertise. A third of survey respondents carried out as part of the TechNation work considered a lack of local talent to be one of their biggest barriers to growth. 
The Small Business outlook (Centre for Cities, 2015) concludes that digital SME's are not randomly or evenly distributed but are concentrated in some cities more than in others as they 'benefit from access to wide pools of talent and specialised expertise and from being in close proximity to other highly innovative businesses'. It goes on to state that 'successful clusters' (such as London's TechCity or Cambridge's Silicon Fen) 'grow organically through the decisions of firms and individuals and the interactions between them'. Cities need to be open to new residents and businesses - providing new housing, good transport and infrastructure as well as a supply of appropriate and affordable (co) working space. 
Eurocities, in its statement on the Digital Single Market Strategy, includes the following areas of potential activity and influence for cities: broadband, the data economy, interoperability and open standards, cyber security, inclusive e-society, e-government, online platforms and smarter cities. 
But, are there good examples of city-led initiatives or strategies to promote the digital economy? 
The answer is that there are lots but most are in large, thriving (often capital) cities such as Barcelona, London, Stockholm, Tallinn and Berlin. These cities are buzzing with people creating new digital businesses and companies developing exciting new technologies. The new European Digital City Index (2015) maps the factors which attract and drive digital entrepreneurs. It scores EU capital cities (and 7 'hub cities') against a range of themes1 to rank the cities in terms of their 'start up' and 'scale up' capacity and performance. Perhaps not surprisingly, London in '1st place' for both start ups and scale ups (followed by Amsterdam, Stockholm, Helsinki and Copenhagen).
However, cities of this nature don’t necessarily offer useful lessons for TechTown partner cities, which are smaller, less well connected and often have access to fewer resources. On the whole smaller cities like these have less developed digital economy strategies – or indeed (as is the case with the majority of TechTown partners) none at all. This is the very reason that TechTown was developed. 
There are of course some examples of city-led initiatives, which provide a useful point of reference and a few examples of initiatives from which it is hoped lessons can be learnt are presented here. 
The first is Dublin, Ireland and its Digital Dublin (2013) initiative which aims to identify, map, benchmark and set targets for the development of a 'Dublin that is innovative, and uses digital tools and solutions effectively, efficiently and assists to drive the economy of the city'. 
Digital Dublin is an alliance of Government, Business, Higher Education and Citizens. Known as the Leadership Forum, this group provides the collaborative and co creating leadership for Digital Dublin bringing together key players from across the digital ecosystem. This structure is said to enable the group to capture ground-level opinion and representation from citizens, civil society, academia and enterprise. 
Digital Dublin has recently developed a Digital Masterplan for the City. This provides a guide for the city in terms of adaption, creation and adoption of digital technologies and processes. It aims to lead to more efficient overall management of the city, its resources and everyday activities. This masterplan encompasses the following principles: 
1. That digital technologies are a facilitator of a more sustainable, cohesive and competitive city region. 
2. That digital technologies are used to realise net job creation across the entire economy. 
3. That ‘Available As Digital’ will be the norm for all Public Services. 
4. That as a progressive open city, welcoming of everybody, all citizens should have opportunities for access to digital technologies. 
5. That we will live by and act through open innovation, embracing a governance model which shares ideas, information and data between sectors, organisations, citizens and with other collaborating cities.
6. That we will embrace digital governance and technologies to increase democratic participation and to stay connected with citizens. 
7. That the city and its stakeholders will use digital technologies, processes and design to continually improve its own performance in the delivery of services for the citizens and business. 
8. That Data(Open and Big) is a key element in developing Dublin as a Digital City. 
9. That Dublin will be a virtual and physical testbed for innovation and will integrate digital technologies into spaces and places of the city. 
10. That Dublin will consistently future proof the infrastructure (e.g. broadband, power etc) required to keep it ahead of the global competition and attractive to inward investment. 
Manchester, UK's Smarter City initiative is another example of a city which seems to be embracing the potential of digital tools and business models. In this case its agenda is embedded within a 'smart cities' initiative which aim to use new technologies and new ways of working to understand and optimise city systems and change how the city functions to improve how people live, work, play, move, learn and organise.
2.2.4. Some lessons from previous URBACT Networks. 
Below is a summary of some of the URBACT networks which have now finished from which useful lessons can be learnt: 
Creative Clusters. 
Creative Clusters was an URBACT II network, which explored the economic value of the creative sector in small urban centres. One of the most relevant findings was the importance of an integrated approach to the local creative eco-system - see diagram below. Many of the features of this ecosystem will also be relevant to the digital and technological sector.
It is clear that there are a number of common features including the importance of incubating, attracting and retaining talent, better understanding the challenges and considering space and governance issues within integrated plans.
ESIMeC. 
ESIMeC explored how demand-led workforce development strategies can be used as instruments of sustainable economic recovery in medium sized cities. Whilst it was sector agnostic as a whole, a number of its transnational events and 'recipes' are relevant to TechTown, in particular those focusing on: 
Partnership working and the relevant of the triple helix to workforce development in knowledge-based industries. 
Integrated approaches to economic development and employment. 

Genius:Open. 
Genius: Open aimed to create innovative solutions to city challenges via an online collaboration platform and through a defined process showing how to use open innovation to engage residents, communities, companies and academics in co-creation
URBACT - Capitalisation 
As well as building on some of the previously funded networks, the findings of URBACT's capitalisation workstreams are also relevant and in particular: 

More Jobs Better Cities (URBACT, 2013) - TechTown's proposed approach to the digital economy is very much in line with the framework for city action on jobs developed through this workstream. It aims to address the job creation potential of the digital economy from the economic and labour market perspective and consider the importance of cross cutting issues such as intelligence, governance and connections. As well as looking at digital jobs per se it will also explore how existing (manufacturing or industrial) jobs can be transformed through digitalisation. 

Job Generation for a Jobless Generation (URBACT, 2015a)- whilst TechTown does not directly target young people, one of the challenges to be addressed in partner cities is how to better match the digital skills of the workforce with those needed by businesses now and in the future. This, along with the planned work on growing and retaining talent is very much in line with the 7 habits and youth-proofing recommendations which came out of the job generation work. 

New Urban Economies (URBACT, 2015b)- one of the main conclusions of URBACT's work on new urban economies was the importance of the digital economy to Europe's cities. The final publication highlights this sector as a 'cradle of new entrepreneurship', at the same time as explaining how digitalisation is also helping to revive urban manufacturing in some places. It also states that medium sized cities also stand to benefit - particularly where they have a technical university to help them attract and retain talent. 

2.3. Role of cities. 
'We are not only just users and consumers, we are also becoming inventors, creators, artists and producers. We can share data, experiences, networks and ideas to co-create, to co-share, to co-invent, to co-produce. We crowdsource, crowdfund. We like to experiment because that is what makes us thrive. We develop the sharing economy on the basis of existing concepts, but from a totally different angle and we are open to change. We don’t aim to buy, own or possess. We rent or lease services and share them to become more innovative and efficient. We don’t want to own knowledge and keep it to ourselves. We provide it to others and try to evolve and spiral upwards together. We put trust in the digital economy and invest in it and in the necessary skills to exploit it to the fullest. We don’t develop linear production lines. We develop circular ones, so we can reuse materials and rely much less on our scarce resources. These are the new societal and business models'.
So, what does all of this mean for TechTown partners? What can small and medium sized cities realistically do to grow jobs through a digital economy? What margins of manoeuvre do they actually have when so many pieces of the macroeconomic and policy jigsaw are outside of their control? 
It is clear that cities are in the process of experiencing a digital transformation, one which brings the citizen closer to the city and, if optimised, creates jobs and develops human capital. 'Digitalisation is changing the way people live their lives, giving them a voice and an opportunity to participate in the delivery of public services' (Busch, Digital Minds, 2015ii) 
The literature review suggests that there is much that cities can do on both the demand and the supply side of the economy. This includes: 
Facilitating open access to data for developers, e.g. mapping, meteorological and real time public transport data as well as information on community level services. 
Enhancing connectivity and making wifi more widely available in public, business and education spaces. 
Leading by example by e.g. embracing app-driven / digital innovations across all sectors, and services, e.g. health, education, enterprise, lifestyle, wellbeing. 
Ensuring a flexible and supportive business environment for start-ups and entrepreneurs – providing affordable spaces, co-working spaces, networking opportunities, flexible business support and access to finance programmes – so as to make it as easy as possible for people to start and grow digital companies. 
Linked to the above, creating living labs for start ups and scale ups with a lighter regulation load and where expertise, talent and investment can co-exist to promote the new European digital entrepreneur. 
Facilitating labour market flexibility and promoting STEM skills development in local schools and training providers (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) to meet demand. 
Encouraging a risk taking, entrepreneurial culture where failure is not frowned upon but rather embraced. 
Brokering relationships and networking opportunities – e.g. between large and small companies, between ‘luvvies and geeks’, along supply chain, between digital companies and others needing digital transformation, between research institutes / education providers and SMEs. 

Perhaps the biggest challenge of all is the need to accept and embrace disruption.
Traditional methods and models will be threatened and transformed through innovation and digitalisation. Some cities may not feel comfortable in this new space. They may not understand it or their role within it. However the message is clear: 'Adapt or Die'.... 
'The future of the smart European digital economy is not five, ten or fifteen years away - it is right now. Therefore the message much be: Adapt, or get left behind' (Joanna Shields, Digital Advisor to the UK Prime Minister in Digital Minds, 2015).

"TOGETHER.
Network of Territories of co-responsibility.
I – INTRODUCTION.
11. The concept of territories of co-responsibility.
The TOGETHER Territories for co-responsibility project is aimed at developing social inclusion and well-being of all. Its main postulate is that social inclusion and well-being for all may be difficult to achieve without a strong cooperation between public authorities, citizens and private actors, in a coresponsibility approach. So, the project aims at building indicators of well-being with citizens in order to develop social inclusion, through policies defined in a strong association with the different representatives of the population and main stakeholders. The TOGETHER project aims at facilitating the integration of marginalized groups (young people, unemployed, alone mothers, homeless, disadvantaged groups, migrants and ethnic minorities…) and to improve their access to public services and social life. It supposes that the development of exchanges of experiences between European cities and territories will give a support to the definition of such policies. The way chosen by cities or territories to define well-being and social inclusion may differ. The principle of this project is to strongly associate the population to the definition of aims to improve social inclusion and well-being for all, and to the implementation of the actions intended to make well-being of all progress. It is supposed that to do so, target groups of the population – such as young people, aged people, unemployed, poor families, deprived areas inhabitants…- will be implicated in the process of consulting and participation. The concern of the European Union for sustainable development – a concept which is linked with the well-being of present and future population – has been recently reassessed in the “Leipzig Charter on Sustainable European Cities”, signed on May 27th of 2007. It says that “Europe needs cities and regions which are strong and good to live in”. It recommends to take into account all dimensions of sustainable development, which include economic prosperity, social balance and a healthy environment, but also cultural aspects. To make the multi-level government really effective, it recommends too to develop a new sense of responsibility for integrated urban development policies, and to involve actors outside the administration, in order to enable citizens to play an active role in shaping their immediate living environment. The TOGETHER project is based upon the concept of co-responsibility. Co-responsibility is not mere participation. Very often, participation is conceived as a top-down process. The public authorities define projects or policies, then they consult the population through public meetings, where the people may criticize or comment the projects exposed. Here, it is a bottom-up process. The principle is that the main stakeholders and citizens of a city or a territory – public authorities, investors, associations, workers, students, pensioners, and so on… - will be associated in the definition and promotion of social inclusion and well-being for all. It means that the different parts of the population will have the opportunity to say what is for them well-being, and to be implied in the definition of actions and in their implementation. Co-responsibility means that the different parts of the population in its diversity feel co-responsible of the actions aimed at social inclusion and well-being. In order to feel so, they must feel that their opinions, wishes, dissatisfactions are taken into account by the local authorities, and that they may play a real part in the decisions which will be taken and in the actions which will be implemented. If they are to be partners of the process, and feel co-responsible of it, they must be really and truly associated and implied. So, the responsibility of the policies and actions done for the progress of well-being of all – including future generations – is not let to the only public authorities, but is shared by all. One possible method of developing co-responsibility has been conceived by the Council of Europe and already implemented and further developed by the city of Mulhouse since 2006, and in some range of cities and territories, throughout the world. The method, which is detailed in appendix, consists in asking the population, organized in homogenous then mixed groups, to say what is for them well-being, ill-being, and how to progress from ill-being towards well-being; then, the method proposes to measure the indicators built with the population in those different groups, to analyse the existing activities and policies at the light of such indicators, to define pilot actions and concerted strategies and the sharing of responsibility for their implementation. In such an approach, it is necessary, in order to define ways of progress towards the well-being of all, to identify situations of exclusion not only by material criteria, but also accounting with immaterial criteria, and to develop pilot actions of social inclusion with the co-responsibility of actors. Recently, in the experiment of this method, an account to the well-being of future generations has been introduced, which brings the method near other approaches of sustainable development. The approach of building indicators of well-being is to be compared with other approaches, developed at either national, regional or local levels, aimed at defining indicators of social cohesion and/or sustainable development, which will be done here. An overview of the literature and practices of building indicators of social cohesion or sustainable development will be proposed. But first, it is necessary to explore the European concepts and goals about social cohesion and wellbeing, taking into account the great inequalities between the different European countries. 
12. The European concept of social cohesion. 
The Lisbon Treaty states that the European Union focuses on three pillars of policy: the promotion of economic, social and territorial cohesion. By defining these three pillars, the EU has made it clear that it is not only engaged in the field of economic matters. The European Commission provides a comprehensive approach for active inclusion. This approach is based on three principles that can be applied to achieve active inclusion of people: income support; active integration; and social services of high quality. The advisory board of the European Commission and European Parliament on regional affaires, the Committee of the Regions (COR) advocates the addition of a fourth principle, which is the social participation for people who for various reasons are no longer able to be active economically. By a policy of active inclusion, these people can get back their self-confidence, improve their personal skills, and again participate in society. These are important conditions for coming back to jobs in the end. Active inclusion as propagated by the European Commission and the COR requires an integrated overall approach for each of these four pillars. Active inclusion is based on the work-first principle, under which every citizen without a job must be given work or training. The first pillar (adequate and sufficient income support) and the third pillar (high-quality social services) have a supporting function. The fourth pillar (social participation) is used as a final resort. Citizens who are unable to work must be helped by means of income support and other initiatives to promote their social participation. In a historic perspective, the European Union used to emphasise economic cooperation : The social dimension of Europe was put on the agenda when the issues of poverty and social exclusion appeared as a field of growing importance in the mid-70’s. In the 80’s, the aim of promoting economic and social cohesion gradually became on of the central European priorities. The first program of exchange between European cities that aimed at developing social cohesion and urban regeneration was URBAN. Fifty-nine projects were implemented within the two URBAN programs – URBAN I 1994-1999, and URBAN II 2000-2006 - , about integrated approaches to urban regeneration, urban governance and partnership social and economic development. These programs concerned all dimensions of urban life, from rehabilitation of deprived environments to labour market actions against unemployment. Local citizens were associated in the development and implementation of the programs, the question of urban deprivation being tackled at grass root level. This has shown the concern of the European Commission for the involvement of all stakeholders in the urban policies and action plans. Social cohesion and inclusion cannot be approached only with monetary criteria, even if the elimination of poverty is a crucial aspect of it. The causes of exclusion may be very diverse and and highly interconnected. Some aspects of social deprivation enhance each other. So, an integrated approach to tackle poverty is needed. Social cohesion needs two kinds of concerns : one obviously is about the access to fundamental goods, such as food, home, health, and public amenities, such as transport… The other aspect regards attitudes and images and prejudices against minorities, which needs needs to change also mentality. In its communication of October 2007, the European Commission describes the need for the active inclusion of people furthest from the labour market as follows: “A sizable part of the Union’s population remains socially excluded, since 16% of Europe’s population is at risk of financial poverty, one in five lives in sub-standard housing, 10% live in households where nobody works, long-term unemployment approaches 4% and the proportion of early school leavers is over 15%.” The European Commission continues in its communication: “In order to help Member States mobilise those who can work and provide adequate support to those who cannot, the Commission has proposed a holistic strategy that can be termed active inclusion. It combines income support at a level sufficient for people to have a dignified life with a link to the labour market through job opportunities or vocational training and through better access to enabling social services.” Integrated urban policies are now mostly area-based, in difference with in difference with sectorbased administration. The policy-making needs to be more bottom-up, and relies on a new kind of governance. This governance is concerned with the strengthening of cooperation and participation, i.e. the association association of different stakeholders, such as citizens, politicians, social organisations and networks, associations, investors, state representatives and local authorities. The empowerment of groups of people who are not used to participate is a challenge. But it is especially important that citizens themselves have a direct part in finding solutions to their own problems, even if the responsibilities of the public authorities must not be set aside put apart. It is the association and work TOGETHER of the citizens and various stakeholders and of public authorities which may give the urban actions and policies their highest efficiency. The association of citizens to the definition of public policies is also a way to develop their social capital, which may be of great help in their well-being and promotion. The importance to act and have success is of great importance for people in deprived areas or facing economic and social exclusion. The strengthening of social networks and community life is necessary to fight against ghettoisation and exclusion. 
13- The state of social cohesion in Europe. 
In order to compare the situation of social cohesion and well-being in the different European countries, we will review the main indicators of income, GDP per capita, employment and unemployment rates and the risk of poverty. It will allow us to better appreciate the situation of the different cities and regions involved implied in the TOGETHER project. According to the Eurostat yearbook 2009, the income inequalities within Europe are still very significant. The GDP per capita at current market prices goes from less than 20 000 Euros in most of the countries of eastern Europe to approaching or more than 40 000 in Scandinavian countries and more than 70 000 in Luxemburg. The average GDP per capita was 24 800 Euros in 2007 in the Europe of 27 countries. The lowest GDP per capita is the one of Bulgaria (3 800), the highest the one of Luxemburg (75 200). The inequality of income distribution, measured by the ratio of total income received by the 20 % of the population with the highest income to that received by the 20 % of the population with the lowest income is the lowest in Scandinavian countries along with Slovenia, Czech Republic, Austria, Luxemburg and Slovakia (under 4) and the highest in Portugal and Lithuania (6,9), Latvia (6,7), Poland (6,6). One of the aims of the European Strategy of Lisbon is to increase the employment rate in Europe. In 2007, the employment rate of the european population aged between 15 and 64 was of 65,4 %, so still under the objective of Lisbon of 70 % for 2010. But it had grown from 60,7 % in 1997. Seven states (Denmark, Netherlands, Sweden, Austria, United Kingdom, Cyprus and Finland) reached the level of 70 %. But in Romania, Italy, Hungary, Poland and Malta, the employment rate was still under 60 %. As for the women, the European Council of Lisbon has fixed an objective of 60 %. In average, it is of 58,3 % in 2007. It is above 70 % in Denmark and Sweden (largely because of the importance of parttime employment). As for the aged people of more than 55, the European objective was an employment rate of 50 %. It is in 2007 of 44,7 %. The average rate of unemployment in the 27 members states of the European Union was 7,1 % in 2007, compared to 9 % in 2003-2004. But it has grown since. There were big differences between the different countries, the highest rates of unemployment having been noticed in Slovakia (11,1 %) and Poland (9,6), and the lowest in Cyprus, Denmark and the Netherlands, under 4 %. Since 2001, the gap between the highest rate and the mowest has declined from 17,6 points to 7,9. Long term unemployment is a big obstacle to social cohesion. The rate of persons being unemployed since more than one year was 3,1 % in Europe in 2007. The female unemployment was 7,8 %, i.e higher than for men (6,6 %). Among young persons under 25 years of age 15,3 % were unemployed in 2007, and this rate was highest in Greece (22,9 %), but also in Italy (15,4 %), Romania (15,2) and Sweden (14,8). At-risk-of-poverty rate after social transfers (the share of persons with an equalised disposable income under 60 % of the national median equalised disposable income) varies from below 10 in Sweden, Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Finland, Slovenia, Austria, Denmark, to more than 20 in Lithuania, Poland, Ireland, Greece, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Latvia, Estonia, Romania, and United Kingdom. Social transfers have allowed to reduce the percentage of the population exposed to the risk of poverty in all European countries, but at different levels. The countries where social transfers have exempted the largest part of the population from poverty are Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Slovenia and Germany. The countries where this effect has been the lowest are Greece, Spain, Italy, Latvia and Bulgaria. The persons aged more than 65 have received a disposable revenue lower than the one of people less than 65, the difference being less than 10 % in Luxemburg, Hungary, Austria, Germany, but being between 30 and 35 % in Estonia, Ireland, Latvia, Cyprus. The risk of poverty for people aged more than 65 is particularly high in Ireland (33 %) and Cyprus (51 %), while it is also significantly high in a number of member states. The income threshold for the risk of poverty is over 7 times higher in Luxemburg and 4 times higher in Austria than in Latvia, Lithuania and Bulgaria and than in Romania, since it varies from 558 Euros a year in Romania to 17 087 Euros in Luxemburg. A partial indicator of social cohesion is that member states with the lowest proportion of people at risk of poverty tend also to have the most equal distribution of income. 
14- The URBACT II Program. 
The URBACT II program is aimed at bringing TOGETHER actors at local and regional levels to exchange ideas and experiences and to learn from each other, on a wide range of urban policy themes. Its purpose is to achieve main objectives of improving the efficiency and impact of urban policies at local level. URBACT II program helps to disseminate knowledge, to share the experiences and examples of good practices collected by the cities, to ensure the transfer of know-how in the field of sustainable development. Facilitating the exchange of ideas and best practices, it calls for the participation of the citizens, through the establishment of Local Support Groups. It develops projects bringing TOGETHER innovative pilot projects in Convergence and Competitiveness regions across Europe. The URBACT II Program is structured around two key thematic priorities: 
- 1. Cities, Engines of Growth and Jobs.
- 2. Attractive and Cohesive Cities. The TOGETHER project is positioned under Priority Axis 2, Attractive and Cohesive Cities, since it promotes social cohesion and well-being for all. URBACT activities are supposed to be implemented with the following steps: 
- Urbact Local Support Groups. Each URBACT partner city or region sets up a Local Support Group bringing TOGETHER local stakeholders most concerned by the issue being tackled. The local Support Group is involved in network activities and contributes to the work conducted by the partners, and is in charge of defining Local Action Plan.
 - Local Action Plans. Each partner has to contribute to producing a concrete Local Action Plan, aimed at tackling the main problems and challenges identified at the beginning of the project. Local Action Plan results in great part from network activities, but it must be defined in close cooperation with the parties concerned in each partner city. It enhances the main actions designed to answer to the problems identified. 
- Managing Authorities Participation. The Managing Authorities have to be strongly associated in the process of defining Local Action Plan. Besides, it is mostly recommended that Managing Authorities participate in the Thematic Networks and Working Groups set up by URBACT Program. 
1. Indicators of social cohesion or sustainable development. 
A new concern. 
Since a few years, there has been a new concern about the measure of sustainable development, mostly as a result of the scientific work being done about the climate crisis. The awareness of environment problems and threats has grown, and it is now more difficult to put as an objective the pursuit of growth without taking into account the damages caused by unconsidered productivism. So, it is getting more accepted to define objectives of sustainable development along with objectives of wealth or of well-being. There has been two periods in the definition of indicators about wealth and development. But the two approaches remain mostly separate. We will heavily rely in this state of the art upon the excellent book of Florence Jany-Catrice and Jean Gadrey, “Les nouveaux indicateurs de richesse”, republished in 2009 in Paris. 
The traditional measure of wealth.
 Traditionally, most of the economists’ works about wealth were built up taking into account the material dimensions of wealth. The main indicator used was the Gross Domestic Product, based upon the production of added value measured in monetary terms. This measure has had a large use and for years was used to compare the different countries and their performances. As early as 1950, many scientists have criticized this measure, calling for a measurement of well being based upon other criteria. They emphasized that pollution costs, for instance, were counted as inputs in the gross national product, and that this indicator did not count most important components of well being, such as public services and domestic work. The main criticism against the indicator of gross national product was its omission of non monetary or non monetarized dimensions (such as domestic work, non monetarized services) and especially of environment and social costs. Also, it is based upon the outputs and not the outcomes. Amartya Sen argued that focus on income measures only assessed the external means that permit individuals to attain various functionings, rather than on valuable capacities. Sen’s capability approach, by comparison, assesses individual well-being with reference to capability sets that describe what individuals are free to do or to become, and takes into account all the relevant dimensions of life, rather than being purely concerned with either access to resources, or achieved utility. In the 90’s, and especially since 1995, the social and environmental questions have led to an increase of initiatives to build alternative indicators: they are about thirty in 2001-2002. According with the presentation of the main of them by Florence Jany-Catrice and Jean Gadrey, we’ll distinguish indicators of human development and social progress, on one side, and indicators about environment on the other. 
A first wave: The development of indicators of social cohesion, social progress and human development. 
In a context of social crisis, growing unemployment and poverty, especially under the effect of economic and financial crisis of 2008, but even before, there has been a certain development of studies and concern about social cohesion. In this aim, indicators of social cohesion have been built by different public authorities, both national and regional or local. In june 2005, the Council of Europe has produced a methodological guidebook for concerted elaboration of indicators of social cohesion. Conceived by Samuel Thirion, this guide proposed a definition of social cohesion based upon the principles of Council of Europe. Comparing the different approaches of social cohesion – by territorial cohesion, through social capital, through quality of life, through the access to rights - , it proposed an interactive approach based upon the co-responsibility of stakeholders, including citizens, firms and professional organizations. For this, after having evaluated social cohesion in its whole and in the field of public action, it defined eight fields of life to measure social cohesion, and proposed too to take into account vulnerable groups of the population. Then it proposed a list of indicators left to the choice of the user. This method has been tested at different territorial scales: at national level in Portugal, France, Czech Republic and Bulgaria; at the regional level in about twenty cities in the Wallon region in Belgium, and in the islands of Cap Vert; at local scale in the urban community of Strasbourg and in Mulhouse. In each territory, the inhabitants have participated in the definition of indicators and evaluation of social cohesion. A new approach of social cohesion has been provided in France by the report of the Stiglitz Commission – Stiglitz, Fitoussi and Sen - about the measure of economic performances and social progress in 2009, report ordered by the French government. This report makes an acute criticism of the limits of the gross internal product, and pleads in favour of a multidimensional approach and measure of well being, not only based upon the material dimensions of wealth, but also upon the different aspects of well being, including the measure of inequality, taking into account the revenue and the consumption of householders and their patrimony. The authors insist also upon the necessity to take into account both objective and subjective dimensions of well being. Last, they recommend to take into consideration the sustainability of development. This report has been greeted as a step forward in the approach of social cohesion and well being, renewing the dimensions considered, and making the link between the measure of well being and the environment concern. But it has also gave the way to criticism from some good specialists of the alternative measure of wealth, such as Jean-Marie Harribey and Florence Jany-Catrice, along with the FAIR group of researchers, for whom this report is still conceived through monetary measures. 
New indicators of sustainable development. 
With the development of a consciousness about the climate and environment crisis, there has been since a few years a new trend of building strategies and indicators of sustainable development all over the world, and especially in Europe. The objective of sustainable development has first been defined by United Nations in 1987. It is included in European Union objectives and into Amsterdam Treaty. It aims to combine a dynamic economy, a high degree of education, of health protection, of social and territorial cohesion, along with the protection of environment, in a world of peace, in respect of cultural diversity. In September 2000, at the 55th session of the general assembly of United Nations, eight objectives of the millenary for the development have been adopted. The member-states have taken the engagement to realize these objectives by 2015. The Lisbon Strategy adopted in March 2000 had as an objective to make Europe the most competitive and most dynamic economy in the world. In June 2001, the European Strategy of Sustainable Development was adopted in Gothenburg in order to complete the Lisbon Strategy which was very weak as what concerns the environment and social fields. Since that, the action plans must limit climate change, structure the transportation system, fight against poverty and social exclusion, bring down risks against public health, face the economic and social consequences of aging, prevent attacks against the quality of life of the populations. The European Council, on his behalf, wishes that at the end of the decade (2010), the half of jobs created in Europe proceed from the information technologies. In March 2000 in Lisbon, it has proposed a set of indicators of economic development. Then, in Gothenburg in 2001, seven other themes have been added, and in Barcelona in 2003, two others: production and consumption models, and good governance. The European Union Strategy for Sustainable Development has been renewed in June 2006. It reasserts the global objective to achieve a continuous improvement of quality of life and well-being on earth for present and future generations, through the creation of sustainable communities, able to use and manage resources efficiently, to use the potentiality of ecological and social innovation of the economy, while insuring prosperity, the protection of environment and social cohesion. The Sustainable Development Strategy asks the European Commission to build up indicators at a detailed level appropriate for a correct appreciation of the situation in regards with each peculiar challenge. The Commission has adopted a first set of indicators in 2005, which have been revised in 2007. These indicators are used to survey the sustainable develoment strategy in a report of Eurostat every two years. Those indicators are based upon ten themes, which reflect the seven key challenges of the European Strategy of Sustainable Development, along with the objective of economic prosperity and good governance. Each theme is treated first under the economic dimension, then under the social, environmental and institutional dimension. There is a distinction made between the indicators which may be available in the two next years, and those which will be developed at long term. 
The limits of those approaches: 
- Two often separate approaches. Despite their interest and complementarity, the different approaches of building indicators of social cohesion or human development on one side, and of sustainable development on the other, have being largely conceived and implemented separately. Fortunately, new approaches more often combine the different indicators. Each one is indeed useful, but one only indicator cannot take into consideration all the aspects of human sustainable development. 
- A lack of citizen’s participation. In the great majority of approaches of building indicators, whether about social cohesion or sustainable development, the citizens’ participation has not been practiced. Mainly, the approaches were led by experts, at the demand of public authorities, but without associating the population. Cases of local stakeholders participation are given by the Flemish City Monitor, by the experience of North-Pas de Calais in France, by the experiment of the Council of Europe method in different territories, and by the Canadian Index of personal security, which is based upon an opinion enquiry. 
The indicators of well being.
 Well-being is a generic concept covering both “subjective” and “objective” well-being. As indicates a survey of the question by the British Treasury5, the psychologist Ed Diener defines well-being as follows: “Subjective well-being refers to all of the various evaluations, both positive and negative, that people make of their lives. It includes reflective cognitive evaluations, such as life satisfaction and work satisfaction, interest and engagement, and affective reactions to life events, such as joy or sadness.” Objective well-being may be defined as follows by the Sustainable Development Institute using Whitehall-agreed definition in Great Britain: “Well-being is a broad concept. Here, it is understood to be a positive physical, social and mental state; it is not just the absence of pain, discomfort and incapacity. It requires that basic needs are met, that individuals have a sense of purpose, that they feel able to achieve important personal goals and participate in society. It is enhanced by conditions that include supportive personal relationships, strong and inclusive communities, good health, financial and personal security, rewarding employment, and a healthy and attractive environment. However, well-being cannot be fully measured by any single indicator.”7 Objective well-being indicators are for instance the UK Sustainable development Index, the UN Human Development Index or the Index of Sustainable Economic Welfare, some of them previously mentioned. There are also the Eurobarometer survey which provides data on life satisfaction for EU member states back to 1973, and the European Social Survey about the feeling of satisfaction with life as a whole. One of the main results is that happiness is not directly related to income – it is called the Easterlin paradox. On the contrary, the negative impact of unemployment on well-being is one of the most striking in the literature. Finally, income is not a good proxy for consumption, because of the important part played by the public sector. So, the method proposed in 2005 by the Council of Europe has great interest. It proposes a methodology in order to build indicators of well being with the participation of inhabitants and various stakeholders, which is therefore very inventive and original. It has no real equivalent, although some experiences conducted in Victoria – the Victorian Community Indicators Project of establishing local community well-being indicators – and in six local governments in Melbourne’s western suburb for culturally and linguistically diverse people have some common points with the approach of the Council of Europe. A third Australian experience, led in Tasmania, the Tasmania TOGETHER, is very near to the method of Council of Europe, since it is a long-term plan to improve the life of citizens by building indicators of well-being through a large survey and meetings over two years; it leads to the use of benchmarks to define goals adopted by the Tasmanian Parliament, and this process is repeated each time with new benchmarks. They may be used by non-government organisations. As for the method of the Council of Europe, the fact that the indicators take now also into account the well being of future generations is a way to associate aims of well being for present population with sustainable objectives. So, this method overcomes the main limit of indicators built separately either for social well being or cohesion or for sustainable development. This method has been tested in 2006-2010 by the urban community of Mulhouse in different neighbourhoods and public services, in an enterprise in Strasbourg, and since one year by twenty Wallon cities, out of which the city of Braine l’Alleud, with the participation of the Wallon Institute of Statistics. But it has also been applied in Cap Vert in the fight against poverty, with a system of autoevaluation of well-being by 300 communitary associations, and now in Gabon in Africa. In these experimentations, the method of co-responsibility of the Council of Europe has proved very useful and inventive. That is why it has seemed useful to be applied in the URBACT TOGETHER Project fot territories of co-responsibility. Yet, it is not the only method existing for developing indicators of well-being, and different other experiences have been applied with similar or comparable approaches. For instance, in Australia, the Tasmania TOGETHER is a long-term plan launched in 2001 to improve life of citizens, which has been developed through a detailed and ambitious survey which involved over 60 public meetings, surveys and proposals over two years, gathering information from the communities themselves. The Plan, approved by Tasmanian Parliament, is redefined each time new benchmarks are put forward. In the same way, the Victorian Community Indicators Project, set up in 2005, aims at establishing a sustainable system for the development and use of local community well-being indicators in Victoria, Australia, with strong citizenship involvement. Another experience has been led with culturally and linguistically diverse communities in six local governments in Melbourne suburbs. In the United States, in California, different experiences have been made to measure and improve the quality of life, for instance in Santa Cruz County, which has built 135 indicators, and where in 2006 over 1000 individuals were involved in setting new goals. In Brazil, the Ministry of Health with the Municipality of Motuca and the University of Sao Paulo has set up in 2002 a project with the aim of improving the population’s health and quality of life using a participatory and holistic approach. 

CONCLUSION. 
Despite their diversity, the eight partner cities are very much engaged in the TOGETHER project for Territories of Co-responsibility, the city of Mulhouse having already a long experience of the process. They have developed a strong partnership with the actors of civil society, and with the main local stakeholders. They have already built or are building their Local Support Groups, and begin to constitute homogeneous groups of the population in order to apply the methodology of coresponsibility proposed by the Council of Europe for the building of indicators of social cohesion and well-being with the different representatives of the population. They have attended training sessions and are well prepared to implement the method. The local public authorities are very much implied in the project and seem ready and very eager to start the process. They expect not only to improve the efficiency of their policies through the results of the project, but to strongly associate the population and to develop the co-responsibility between the citizens, public authorities and different stakeholders. The diversity of the partner cities will be an advantage for the potential of dissemination of the TOGETHER project, since there will be some big cities, and some of smaller size, with various economic and social backgrounds, various historical traditions of participation. The TOGETHER project for territories of coresponsiblity should provide an interesting material for URBAN program, since at the difference with other projects more thematic, its approach is transversal and covers different aspects of social cohesion, sustainable development and well-being for cities.

"TUTUR.
Temporary Use as a Tool for Urban Regeneration.
Introduction. 
Cities are habitually perceived and described referring to steady material structures/infrastructures, while less considered are the temporary aspects of life in the urban space. Ordinary town planning tools cannot completely manage land uses in the city, residual space constellate, break and re-shape the ideal planned city. European cities present urban textures that offer formal and informal possibility of development. Very often spaces for innovative development are those not considered, or through unforeseen externalities produced, by conventional planning tools: invisible “remains”, for normative land use management tools, with a high potential of triggering creative energy for forthcoming urban developments. The urban textures of many EU cities are not compact and homogenous, for different reasons; first of all, it is possible to meet in many EU cities’ fabrics a number of “urban bugs”. These unexpected, out of plans, “bugs” are currently the places where temporary uses become established. The main question to answer in TUTUR (Temporary Use as a Tool for Urban Regeneration) is:  How can practices of temporary uses be mainstreamed and framed in replicable, and effective urban regeneration policies/programmes/strategic plans schemes?  In other words, many current practices shown as temporary uses can play a strategic role in urban regeneration and development. It means that both public and private sectors can support their development in different ways. The question, nowadays, is not to formalize the spontaneity of these practices in “caging” them into planning or policies procedures, but to enlarge/enrich the current running urban regeneration policy schemes/approaches with new key features bred within temporary use experiences. Is it a coincidence that the first structured policies on temporary uses in Europe came to light in Bremen?  If we remember the Grimm’s tale “The Bremen Town Musicians”, we would easily recognise a pioneer practice of temporary uses. In fact, the cat, the donkey, the dog and the rooster, the four musicians going to Bremen, protected a house, where they found a temporary shelter, from the robbers and…”From that time forth, the robbers did not dare go back into the house. However, the four Bremen Musicians liked it so well there, that they never left it again.” An evident, clear example of temporary use… with a happy ending.  The ZZZ experience has already identified and, brought to happy end, many projects in 4 years of activity. Moreover, it is probably even not a case that the precursors of temporary uses are part of the creative class, as the four musicians. In fact, bounding into the promoted contemporary practices, many of projects, re-uses, made possible through the action of the ZZZ team, include the participation and the engagement of citizens, that in order to give a new meaning to use of abandoned buildings/area, make an extraordinary effort in being flexible and creative. In other words, a part of the successful practices homes in the will of the “temporary users.” The permanent collaboration with local “actors/stakeholders/shareholders networks” makes the temporary uses actions more effective, and through a strengthened network, it is easier to sustain a new initiative in a neighbourhood. Temporary uses have to become acknowledged as “catalysers” of economies to be exploited through urban regeneration/development initiatives; this is one major challenge of TUTUR. This challenge has to be accomplished through the LAPs (Local Action Plans) implemented in the partner cities: Rome (Lead partner), Alba Iulia and Bremen (best practice provider in the project partnership). LAPs will be based on participatory planning approaches, starting or re-organising the active involvement of local stakeholders. Today, investors, projects developers, landowners, development agencies (public and/or private), municipalities get the value of these “in between” developed practices. They start to see how these “in between spaces”, urban bugs, urban voids, bauluecken, vuoti urbani, are drivers of local rooted processes, and how these processes have a high degree of manifold sustainability. Many of the current positive place-making activities with perspective/with future have their seeds in these urban areas which, most of the time, casually and unpredictably pop up and out from the city fabric. “Key urban actors do not see temporary use as the hobby of social engaged planners any more, they see that effective and sustainable development of “life in the city” (das urbane Leben) should be linked to contextual aspects (Christiaanse, 2013).” Finally, it is evident that practices of temporary uses are increasingly catching on all over European cities. There are different reasons that can be identified explaining this rising trend, among which (Lehtovuori, 2013):  1. Financial crisis: undermined faith in perpetual growth, cuts in public spending, less investments in urban development.  2. Industrial restructuring and technological advancements in logistics and commercial restructuration continue to leave behind large areas of vacant land and real estate.  3. Contemporary flexible office work requires less floor space, which also increases vacancies.  4. The trend is towards multi-use of different kinds of properties in order to cut operation costs and achieve greater efficiency.  5. The uses of popular public spaces are intensifying.  6. Neither property market nor the public authorities are or will be able to meet all the spatial needs of counter-culture activities.  7. New technologies enable spreading the word with a great speed and penetration among communities of interest.  8. The rising significance of creative industries has drawn increasing attention to “creative milieus”, to which temporary uses contribute significantly.   TUTUR has the opportunity to exploit through the URBACT methodology potentialities entrenched in such practices in working with three cities representing significant dimensions of EU polycentric fabric: the small scale (Alba Iulia), the medium sized scale (Bremen) and the metropolis (Roma). TUTUR will understand and put in place in these diverse urban contexts the messages generated and delivered by these practices, finding out other reasons of this urban phenomenon, and will orient them towards future regeneration actions, operational plans and effective policy schemes. The project will address planning instruments capable to understand trends and requests coming out from local communities and place-based actions.
  Temporary Use and urban regeneration: Projects and networks.  Urban regeneration policies are a forefront laboratory in integrating the small-scale politics coming from different disciplines and levels (multi-level and multi-disciplinary approach) because of the variegated range of social, economic and spatial issues present in these areas to be revitalized/ redeveloped/ renewed/ rehabilitated/ requalified/ developed. Designing and implementing urban regeneration policies means fixing one’s attention on the topical transformation of the contemporary city in its more disadvantaged areas, nonetheless even in the more requested for implementing new development. Models arising from these policies are, moreover, very interesting schemes for interpreting, in general, complex and integrated policies. The bloom of temporary uses practices in the last 20 years in many European cities is an indicator that we have to take into account to understand and accompany the definition of new tools for facilitating urban regeneration processes.  “Activities of temporary uses can be transient, take place only once, for a limited time; recurrent, repeating, for instance annually, like Paris Pláge, bringing beaches to the Seine’s river front every summer since 2002. The activities can also be migrant, i.e. the activities may change place from one location to another, as development proceeds, like the temporary-placed New York Trapez School which has changed location repeatedly following phases of Manhattan’s Hudson River Park development” (Ruoppila, 2012).  However, independently on their quality, they move things, change governance balances, pave the way to innovative development opportunities, define new ways for communities’ ownership of urban spaces: they catalyse urban transformation processes. Additionally, “Temporary use is not a new social phenomenon. Temporary ventures have always been a feature of cities that were conceived and built for the long term. More recent development surpass this however. Temporary uses are now becoming more diverse, are putting their stamp on a growing number of city locations and are increasingly a structural component of urban development” (Overmeyer, K. 2007). What it is interesting is how the phenomenon of temporary use is currently becoming a central topic for urban regeneration policies in many European towns, and how many urban planners and architects are paying more and more attention to these kinds of informal practices. In the recent years, because of the real estate bubble’s explosion and the resulting financial meltdown, a significant surplus in available square meters emerged even in the most dynamic city economies. A few years after the outbreak of the economic crisis, many European cities and regions suffer from the withdrawal of economic activities from commercial spaces of various kinds. As usual, mutations/evolutions in urban planning tools have roots in practices breeding and some cities and afterwards become common planning culture. Even in the case of temporary uses, we can identify a number of cities that paved the way to this current trend. As already stated, urban regeneration is an excellent laboratory in which to test and verify the consistency of the pillars that underpin territorial cohesion and define the integrated territorial approach. Improving design and implementation processes of urban regeneration policies through the better understanding and contextualization of temporary uses practices means finding ways:  a) To identify, measure and promote different forms of sustainability (environmental, cultural , economic, institutional , social, ... ), that need to be mobilized in the specific "" Area -based Initiatives "";  b) To find specific/specialized strategic - evolutionary paths based on following urban planning key designs:  places, in the sense of finding their common features and their differences;  governance (horizontal and vertical ), since these initiatives require the definition of complex balances between institutional, and private citizens (not just integration of economic resources, but the construction of ""structural formulas – complex , effective and efficient support policies);  participation/community involvement , that it is very difficult and hard to practice in effective ways (procedural - political sustainability is here even an issue);  public space , where the new function/s is/are often the critical component/s for the success of the initiatives;  quality of life, as it is basically a constitutive part of the regeneration processes, it is difficult to measure, but ultimately has a significant relative weight in the positive or negative evaluation of public and private sectors actions in these kind of urban transformations.  Finally, the city of Bremen, in TUTUR, is playing the role of “knowledge giver/provider”. In fact, the Bremen-based ZwischenZeitZentrale (ZZZ) is one of the first temporary use programs established by a municipality in cooperation with an NGO. The ZZZ has worked with at least 50 vacant properties of different scales and nature: from small shops of 30m up to industrial areas of 4.500m, summing up approximately 10.000m surface in buildings and 80.000m of brownfields across the whole territory of Bremen, engaging a great variety of users in the use of these spaces. Bremen will be taken as a “content and experience provider” in TUTUR, of course in keeping into account all limit set for practices transferability linked to the different planning systems, knowledge and heritage.  
Synthesis of the baseline in giving and receiving cities.
 The main challenge of the TUTUR project will be to find common grounds for the transfer of Bremen’s ZZZ good practice to Rome and Alba Iulia. Albeit a small consortium, it is by no means a homogenous one, effectively covering three very different situations. During the joint discussions held at the kick-off meeting, several differences and common challenges have been revealed, issues that will later be overcome by a custom-tailoring of the best practice of Bremen. Difference is a “unique selling point” of this project, as we can experiment temporary uses in diverse and urban contexts. A diversity that is in the size, (a metropolitan area, a medium sized city and a small sized one), in the different grade of competitiveness and in the richness of the available planning instruments for urban regeneration. All three cities have good experiences in citizens’ involvement and development based on communities.  Agency. 
 First of all, in what concerns transferring the good practice of the Agency, the conclusion of both Alba Iulia and Rome has been in favour of adopting a similar model, with certain differences motivated by differences in scale, local political and administrative climate and so on. The aim of the Agency will primarily be to interface between the potential users and the available vacant spaces, but it can also go beyond this intermediary role to help regenerate currently vacant spaces and to improve social and economic conditions. Given the late socio-economic climate and the pressures young and / or unemployed creative people are facing, the ultimate product of creating this Agency could, in fact, be the one of establishing a regulated “parallel economy” to sustain activities otherwise having slim chances of survival in today’s market economy.  Alba Iulia is a small city of around 60.000 inhabitants and could set up an agency as a separate entity from the Municipality, in which case the organization could adopt other responsibilities in interfacing with citizens as well. Rome on the other hand is a city of 2,8 million inhabitants and the questions regarding a temporary use Agency revolve around other aspects consistent with both its size and statute as well as the shift in paradigm regarding soil consumption that it currently faces; Rome’s primary open questions regard its relationship to the districts in the municipality, and ultimately the most effective number of Agencies which could be set up (either an overall one or one per municipality).  In both cases, several common key aspects will have to be defined and adapted in the following TUTUR steps. 
Defining and imparting responsibility for both constituting and running the Agency is the most important one in the beginning stages of the project, since it sets the framework for dealing with the Target Groups and the subsequent implementation of temporary use projects. Although the possibilities are many (running the Agency from the municipality or as an external organization, including several key stakeholder, conferring the Agency a large degree of autonomy, involving external experts and keeping a flexible structure), a custom-tailored option will have to be defined for each receiving city in order to ensure maximal efficiency of the agency to deal with both potential users and vacant lots (municipality- and privately-owned). A second aspect of setting up a temporary use agency in Rome and Alba Iulia is related to the way it will interface with the potential users. The target user groups defined by the cities are very similar: young designers, people involved in arts and culture, NGOs, potential investors and also the local residents as beneficiaries of positive externalities. The Agencies will have to ultimately cater to the target groups, and that raises the questions of project calls as an effective means of collecting projects (“How open should a call be?”), and the subsequent evaluation process of the winning projects (jury-led process of selection).  
Cartography.  
The second instrument that will have to be set in place, as agreed within the consortium, will be a form of publicly and interactively displaying an encyclopaedia of the vacant properties in each city, similar or even part of the German Leerstandsmelder.  In each city, there are pre-existing initiatives that can be used to create the online directory of potential temporary use properties: Alba Iulia recently implemented and currently pilots a Geoblog that can be used to insert a “vacant property” layer, while Rome doesn’t have an online interactive cartography of the city, but many citizen associations do. Observatory city Budapest also has a crowdmap of vacant properties. This already-collected data can prove itself very useful, and a vacant lot platform can ultimately be built either by using already-there platforms or maps, or by integrating the thematic information on vacant properties with other layers as well.  Crowdsourcing information from the citizens regarding vacant property can be useful in more ways than one: it adds to official data in a quicker and less expensive way and it engages the community from the planning phases of the temporary use process. However, it can also have its downturns, as direct citizen input can oftentimes be inaccurate. Thus, several questions arise in relation to this online platform: How and how much can citizens be involved in data collection? How to get reliable, up-to-date data? How to relate official and crowdsourced data? Should the platform be managed by the city or should a third party be in charge of it (and subsequently the proofing process of citizen data?).  
Temporary use.  
Regarding the practice per se, the way to go with adapting Bremen’s approach for urban regeneration has yet to be defined in Alba Iulia and Rome, based on constant dialogue with the target users. Many of the success stories in reconverting vacant lots in Bremen have been case-by-case situations, and it is evident that an overall approach will prove itself ineffective, mainly because the definition and implementation of “temporary” is interlinked with the types of uses, the target groups, the physical conditions of places and whether the properties are municipality- or privately-owned.  There are still aspects which will be part of the overarching strategy the cities will employ, and which will define the overall framework for temporary use in Rome and Alba Iulia:  Inserting temporary uses in the development processes of the cities;  A framework for developing successful processes from temporary to permanent;  The definition of the type of contract between the user and the owner: compensation, financial or otherwise;  A policy of functional mixing between living and working spaces;   Incentives towards property owners to join the program;  Lobbying, municipal and regional support, etc.  
Legal framework.  
It has been apparent even from the start that the participating cities have very different legal frameworks, which will account for different approaches in setting temporary use into place. Neither Rome nor Alba Iulia have local regulations or strategies specifically aimed towards temporary use, which means that the practice will have to be inserted into the legal framework; this could represent an opportunity to integrate the practice in planning, as opposed to the current situation in which the different typologies of temporary use oftentimes refer to different legislation.  Crucial aspects of making temporary use realistically an option for the receiving cities concern first of all designing a simplified application procedure for these practices as an incentive, together with defining the relationship between formal and informal in tackling these issues. Bremen’s success relies partly on the flexibility it employed in dealing with implementing temporary use in a non-standardized way, which oftentimes meant having a less-than-transparent selection process of projects. In Italy and Romania, this kind of increased flexibility clashes with the bureaucratic way in which these processes are usually implemented, thus having a low chance of success. 
Business model and Financing.  
Ultimately, in order to ensure the long-term viability and effectiveness, the Agencies’ financial sustainability has to be dependent not just on the municipality (as the Bremen case study shows), but has to benefit from a diversity of funding sources. While Rome’s preferred financing is public and Alba Iulia is open to experiment a public-private business model, there are also other local opportunities that can be used to supplement the main source, such as Crowdfunding or income generated from the temporary uses themselves. Additional funding may also be pursued from ERDF or ESF, and, of course, defining favourable conditions for private investors.

"The UNIC Project and Network
The main objective of the project is to allow all European cities impacted by economic transition - from a traditional economy with strong “heritage” value conveying cultural identity, towards a sustainable innovation economy - to anticipate, prevent and address the economic, cultural and social consequences of these changes and to begin moving effectively towards a sustainable innovation economy linking research and education, economy, culture, social and urban promotion.
This economic transition from the industrial era towards an innovation economy has already begun in many cities in Europe, including the project partner cities. Some experiments had varying success regarding harmonious, integrated and sustainable urban development. The UNIC project wishes to share these experiences, to capitalize on them and to give value to them through exchanges of know-how, knowledge and good practices.
An urban economy is weakened when one single industry prevails or makes up the main economic activity. Subcontractors, employees and all the urban local economy that this activity involves are endangered. The principal challenge will be to put forward the policies to be carried out to staunch the decline: to increase “traditional know-how”, to support new initiatives in innovation, to work on a better match between heritage and innovation in order to offer a new image of the cities and thus to reinforce their “attractiveness” while offering living conditions, professional and personal development perspectives likely to “gain loyalty” from inhabitants and companies, and also attract new ones.
3. The Baseline Study/
The objective of the Baseline study is to provide a contextual framework defining and supporting the activities of the network through the time-line of the programme.
In this sense the purpose of the baseline study is threefold:
- To assess local policies and practices which have already been implemented or not and to bring out ideas on the practices, methods and tools which could be implemented by partner cities or could be suggested to the partner cities.
- To report on and assess the expectations, prime concerns and requirements of the partners with a view to refining the activities to be undertaken by the network.
- To set-out the organisational and content framework for the programme taking account of the first two elements (detailed agenda and time-planning, division of tasks and identification of required inputs, definition of lead questions, intended outcomes etc.)
Within the framework of UNIC, the baseline study has been mainly considered as a working document that would highlight the synergy and common challenges faced by the partners, establishing the starting point for a cooperation that could led each partner one step further into is transition into a more competitive and innovative city.
3.2 Baseline study – The framework
An urban economy is weakened when one single industry prevails or makes up the main economic activity. Subcontractors, employees and all the urban local economy that this activity involves are endangered.
The principal challenge will be to put forward the policies to be carried out to staunch the decline:
to increase ""traditional know-how"",
to support new initiatives in innovation,
to work on a better match between heritage and innovation in order to offer a new image of the cities and thus to reinforce their ""attractiveness"" while offering
living conditions, professional and personal development perspectives likely to ""gain loyalty"" from inhabitants and companies, and also attract new ones.
The question that UNIC partners will try to address is:
“How can local economic communities based on traditional industries, and in particular ceramics, prosper in the rapidly changing, increasingly open global
economy?”

3.2.1 The European challenge
The ceramic industry is exceptionally broad and far-reaching, impacting nearly every facet of our lives. The industry is traditionally categorized into four main sectors— tableware, advanced ceramics, tiles/brick/structural clay and refractories — many of which also have their own internal segments. All of these facets of the ceramic industry enjoy individual successes and opportunities, and face their own challenges. Following are some recent trends, highlights and forecasts for each sector.

Over the last decade, the ceramics market is become increasingly competitive, mainly due to the pressure of low-cost imports, principally from Asia and Eastern Europe. A more expensive labour force and strict regulations in the EU countries have made it difficult for EU manufacturers to compete. To cope with the increasing competition, several EU manufacturers established manufacturing bases in Asia, where they could combine their state-of-the-art technology with a low cost base. In this way, they could maintain an efficient, high-quality production system at low cost. Another answer to the increasing competition was to achieve “economics of scale”. Mergers and acquisitions were a popular means to build the scale necessary to survive. This led to the development of large multinationals, which are present worldwide.
Increasing rivalry in other sectors, contributed to the increasing competitiveness of the ceramics tableware market. Because of the relatively high margins and the need to create more “traffic”, retailers, like grocery multiples and discounters, started selling ceramic products as table- & kitchenware. They mainly sell low-priced products, often private label. This undermined the position of the EU manufacturers, which were mostly positioned in the premium-end of the market. Many manufacturers searched for ways to differentiate their products, and branding therefore became more important.
Because of the increasing competition in the ceramics market, it is increasingly difficult for manufacturers, especially small-scale ones, to retain a profitable share of the EU markets. Although the developing countries share of EU imports is growing, it should be noted that this growth is partly due to outsourcing by Western manufacturers on the one hand and a number of large manufacturers mainly based in China and Thailand, on the other. Chinese exports make up between 37 and 82 percent of the EU imports deriving from developing countries.
Overall there is a shift that has led tablewares become a more fashionable market, with new trends, designs and colours emerging every twelve to eighteen months. The trend towards a more fashionable market however, has some implications like, for example, shorter product life-cycles, making fast and accurate distribution indispensable. This offers chances for small-scale manufacturers to tap into specific market developments. Ceramics products that are new, innovative and have a reasonable amount of quality, practicality and functionality, will be viable. Items which are highly original in terms of colour and design are promising, because they allow retailers as well as consumers to differentiate themselves. The advanced ceramics sector is arguably the most robust segment of the ceramic industry. According to a recent report from Enceram, the market for engineering ceramics (defined in the report as structural, environmental and process applications) reached $2.7 billion in Europe and $1.9 billion in the U.S. in 2006. Drivers for growth include applications in armour, automotive (diesel particulate exhaust filters and composite brakes), medical (joint replacement and dental products), electronic sensors and wear parts. Fuel cell applications are also expected to have a positive impact. For example, according to Innovative Research and Products, the market for micro fuel cells is expected to reach $112 million by 2011, rising at an incredible 55.7% annual average growth rate from $12 million last year. For ceramic tiles, although overall consumption set a new record in 2006, the following years were worse due to the slowdown in the new housing market and decline in overall floor covering sales. The strong remodelling and commercial markets continued to bolster tile sales overall, however. Remodelling also especially impacts the tile industry, since the two rooms most frequently remodelled are kitchens and bathrooms. The Freedonia Group projects that U.S. demand for hard surface flooring will advance 3.9% per year to 11.9 billion square feet in 2011 (valued at $13.5 billion). Hard surface flooring is expected to continue to gain market share from carpets and rugs, and demand will be driven by the growing consumer preference for high-end products such as wood, laminates and ceramic tile. Sanitaryware manufacturers also benefit from the increasing renovation trend for bathrooms, though the residential housing slump is now having a negative effect. But the continued decline of the housing industry is providing multiple challenges for the industry. As regards refractories, according to the International Iron and Steel Institute (IISI), 2006 saw a particularly strong 8.5% worldwide increase in steel use. The projection for 2007 is a 5.9% increase, and 2008 should see an additional increase of 6.1%—all great news for the refractories industry. Steel demand growth in Africa, Asia and South America was particularly strong, while North America should see a positive trend for 2008 following an inventory draw-down in 2007. The IISI further reports that China remains the single largest market and strongest growth area for steel. Steel use in China is forecast to increase by 13% in 2007 and 10% in 2008, encompassing 35% of the world total. According to the IISI, steel consumption in China was 442.7 million metric tons (mmt) in 2006, a far cry from Japan (116.2 mmt), the U.S. (98.6 mmt), Russia (70.8 mmt) and South Korea (48.5 mmt). Overall, for all subsectors, the times are of change and the challenges ahead are considerable. Up-to-date information on trends and developments is therefore more important than ever, and innovation and marketing are key for the viability of the sector. The famous words of Peter Drucker make all the sense for the European ceramics sector: “Business has only two basic functions: marketing and innovation”. And those will be the two main dimensions of the UNIC project. 
3.2.2 Innovation Scenarios
There are at present two clear distinct and competing innovation scenarios for local economies: — ‘Hollowing-out’   Local companies reaching farther afield to tap into the global network of ideas and skills, and eventually moving out altogether. — ‘Agglomeration’. Local companies strengthening their local ties..Local/regional economy emerging as a centre of new knowledge creation and application, stimulating and attracting new enterprise. High technology companies, once tied to their locations, can now move their production to anywhere in the world. Still in order to stay competitive, key parts of their operations need to be based in knowledge and innovation-intensive regions. To be globally competitive countries, regions and cities need to invest in their Innovation Systems. The UNIC challenge is to promote the “Agglomeration” scenario in the partner cities for local firms, while at the same time trying to capture external firms “hollowing-out” from other regions. For that they must build on their competitive factors, often related with their tradition and heritage to set the context and stimulate the creation of local knowledge (“Combining heritage and innovation”), namely through intervention – direct or indirect – in 4 areas, as pictured below: provision of public space, educating people, creating and disseminating knowledge and contributing to problem solving for industry. Public research centres and universities are key players, as they can contribute to all four. A city that is not able to provide competitive offers in the 4 components above will not be able to foster the creation of knowledge and loose the possibility to follow an innovation-led growth path – which is possibly the only sustainable path for growth in Europe. But for a competitive affirmation of cities and regions in a dynamic context, another dimension must also be considered, important for the attraction and retention of talents (the “City as a centre of attraction”), which are in turn also vital for knowledge creation: the “identity creation” dimension, through intervention in another 4 areas: capacity to offer social and cultural life, affordable housing,, appropriate level of services, and a dynamic and attractive “brand” and image (e.g. as Italy for design, France for food, …). These aspects matter - policy often focus on few high technology fields, but 70% of OECD countries workforce is in the service sector and cultural industries are becoming a major driver globally, accounting for 7% of GDP and growing at 10% annually. The two dimensions – “Combining heritage and innovation” and “City as a centre of attraction” – are not absolutely independent. On the contrary, quite often an intervention in one area causes an effect in the other, while some efforts lay in-between these two dimensions. This “grey area” between the two dimensions above-mentioned is in itself a third dimension for intervention, referred within the scope of the UNIC project as “Integrated Urban Approach”. Within the present baseline, all partner cities will be evaluated, as regards their strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT) in face of three dimensions above, and focusing on the ceramics heritage that is the core of the project and links all partner cities. 

3.2.3 Innovation-led growth paths
Cities in quest of economic development face four pathways of regional innovation-led growth, which in some cases of partner cities have already been initiated as demonstrated in the examples below: 1. Indigenous creation of new industry (Create entirely new industry) Examples: Silicon Valley: Personal computers; Castellón: Ceramic Tiles in the 50’s and 60’ as a new investment opportunity for the wealth generated in the agro-food sector (mainly production of oranges), and benefiting from the local conditions (seaport) and availability of raw materials. While Ceramic Tiles where known for years, its creation as a mass production industry very much started in Castellón and today, the Valencia region is a global leader in the tiles and ceramics industry. 2. Exogeneous creation of new industry (Transplantation of new industry into region) Examples: Taipei-Hsinchu corridor (Taiwan): Electronics industry Aveiro: Telecommunications and semiconductors. Famous for years mainly for its ceramics industries, Aveiro has become since the 80’s one of Portugal main centres for telecommunications and semiconductors industries. With a first anchor investment from Portugal Telecom R&D Group – PT Inovação and a renowned university in the field since 1973 the town has recently attracted investments from Nokia/Siemens, NEC, Ericsson, or GFI Informatique, allowing the creation of a cluster in the field. 3. Diversification of existing industry into new (Use the core technologies of an existing and declining industry) Examples: Akron (USA): Tires. Advanced polymers. Limoges: Ceramics. Electric appliances. The example of Legrand Electric is a good example of (early) diversification. Legrand’s history dates back to 1860, when a porcelain workshop was set up in Limoges, the porcelain capital of France, and was then the porcelain capital of the world. When Legrand took over the business in 1904, he saw the opportunity for expanding operations from producing dinner plates to making electrical switches, which were then made not from plastic, but from porcelain. In 1949 a key turning point was reached, when it was decided to focus exclusively on the production of electrical installation wiring devices and Legrand turned out its last dinner plate. In 1966, the company set up its first overseas subsidiary in Belgium and has continuously grown ever since to become world’s largest manufacturer of switches and current outlets, holding 18 per cent of the market, and to lead the world in sales of low voltage cable routing products, with a market share of 15 per cent. 4. Upgrading of existing industry (Enhance products, services or production technologies) Examples: Tampere, Finland: Industrial machinery Faenza: Services for the Ceramics sector. Traditionally known as the ""Ceramics Town"", the pottery sector no longer has significant revenue-producing weight in Faenza’s economy: only a few industries and about 60 craftsmen produce artistic pottery. However, Faenza’s strength in this field is its network of agencies and services revolving around the local ceramics sector: the schools structure; scientific research; the International Museum of Ceramics, the most important such structure in the world. Faenza has also supported and promoted, over recent years, a series of initiatives to valorise pottery cultures, ranging from international meetings to competitions and exhibitions, up to the recent foundation of AICC - the Italian Ceramic Town Association, whose mission is to create a national network of towns with a significant history of ceramist activity. While most of the public attention is usually focused on paths 1 and 2 – which can promote the most spectacular growths – paths 3 and 4 are equally important, and often more viable. Innovation is mostly incremental, rather than radical and it is not confined to science-based industries, as low tech fields innovate too. Within the UNIC project, each partner city is expected to make its own path – building on cooperation with other cities – towards innovation. What is clear is that: Success conditions (and failure modes) for each of these 4 pathways are different. .Patterns of innovation in each case are also different. Roles of High Educational Institutions, financial institutions, governments and others, for each pathway, are again different. The context for the two extreme scenarios (Type 1 and Type IV) are presented in Picture 3 below, while the minimal conditions for developing each of the paths are presented in Picture 4 further below. The main trends and case studies at European level – to be further considered within the UNIC project by partner cities according to their own needs – are described next: Financing: VC in Europe is still very much the feud of banks and investment funds which impose their own procedures and add further burden to a process which is already heavy due to European legislation for company creation or sales. It is necessary to facilitate the entry into the VC market of small firms and individuals and promote public early stage funding which is simple and does not require too many guarantees – a kind of “informal” VC, unlike the more formal, bank dominated, market that traditionally goes by the rule that says “in order to get a bank loan first you need to prove that you don’t need one”. The trend is to move from a IP-oriented form of public support typical of a closed innovation paradigm – where state aids are given to industries for development of intellectual property (either individually or in cooperation with research centres) – to a open innovation model of VC – oriented public support: the “from IP to VC” trend that characterizes open innovation. In this model state aids could support the creation of private venture funds, e.g. managed by industrial companies that would be used to finance innovation in a network of small new firms, thus fostering innovation at a much greater pace. Venture capitalists, like researchers, may find the concept of open innovation difficult to accept. Patents are often the only asset of a start-up company and VCs may therefore be nervous about the prospect of their funded company sharing this asset within a collaborative arrangement. They will also be concerned about the fact that the return to their company may be in the form of royalties or other performance-related payments. A shift towards a new funding paradigm - from co-funding internal research (shared costs perspective) to co-funding external venture investments (shared risks – and benefits – perspective), will require a whole new set of rules and mechanisms. Governments may also be able to influence the role of VC in the development of open innovation by means of tax or other incentives which provide benefits to funders of companies whose revenue is derived from participation in open innovation. Innovation-Culture: The creation of an innovation culture is complex and often demands a combination of efforts from a multitude of actors, around a so-called “Urban Innovation Engine” .An “Urban Innovation Engine” is a system which can trigger, generate, foster, and catalyze innovation in the city. Typically, it is a complex system that includes people, relationships, values, processes, tools and technological, physical and financial infrastructure (Dvir, 2003). A close examination of the constructs of a typical city reveals that many of the city constructs can serve as Innovation Engines. However, not every University, or Library, or Industrial District, for example, do play the role of a true innovation engine. There is always a unique combination of intangible factors which turn a specific ordinary urban organ into an innovation engine. These factors have been described above as the principles of innovation ecology. This set might include, for example, a strategic intention, an explicit vision to use it as an innovation engine, exceptional leadership, a stimulating physical space, an urgent need or challenge, special team… One of the most effective innovation engines is the organisation of large scale events – an opportunity to gather a multitude of actors around a common and challenging objective and induce a mind-set. What is common to Paris 1900 and Barcelona 2004? Both are fine examples of cities who used large-scale events as innovation engines. The “Paris Exposition Universelle de 1900” was an opportunity for many nations to present and share their scientific and cultural achievements. It was also a trigger to push forward the state-of-art in diverse areas - the Tour Eiffel is perhaps the most impressive manifestation of this in the area of innovative engineering. The visioning and organisation of “Forum Universal de las Culturas 2004” was one of the many tangible steps of the city to realize its vision “Barcelona knowledge city”. At a different scale and related to the ceramics field, events like Stoke Ceramics Biennial or Faenza Ceramics Contest are good examples of this innovation engines. Local Anchors (University-Industry relations) and Technology Transfer: Cities must be able to foster the development of more open models of collaboration between research organisations and companies; a model where companies can more easily share resources, staff and results with different research organisations and assume the lead of cooperative projects. The research-industry gap in Europe is basically a cultural gap. The French philosopher Roland Barthes, speaking about culture once said: neither culture nor its destruction (anti-culture) are “sexy” – what is really “sexy” is the gap between them. The same can be said of research and industry –what is sexy is the gap between them, where creativity and experimentation mixes with market needs and production capabilities to generate the innovations of the future. Innovation is played in the gap, yet the gap in Europe has been a deserted “no man’s land” for years. More than bridging the gap, it is important to fill it, with the creation of research organisations that think and operate as companies and with whom companies can therefore easily cooperate; Initiatives such as the Centres of Excellence are a step in the right direction, but if the ties between the different participants are too loose and the structure is too informal, they might become just another network. Better results have been achieved in countries like The Netherlands with the promotion of Public-Private-Partnerships, between universities and companies, for the creation of formal research organisations that are managed in a corporate way and become relevant service providers of research and innovation services, thus “opening” innovation processes. But for this, must public universities in Europe must facilitate their internal procedures for entering into the capital of private companies. As regulation on IP revolutionised the way US universities did research in the 60-70’s – with Europe lagging behind and only seriously addressing IP regulations in universities over the last years – new, enhanced regulation is now needed for facilitating the participation of universities in PPP and private endeavours. Education and Training: The ambition and creativity of the individual is the spark that fosters innovation. Individuals need to develop these skills through their education and training. There also needs to be space for individuals to express their skills in the workplace and society. Thus it is important to discover which policies will create such an environment, in addition to the traditionally emphasised skills of engineers and scientists (e.g. artists, designers, as in Delft or Cluj). At the same time, while innovation is a positive force, it can also cause upheaval. In many cases, entire industries are changed beyond recognition or cease to exist. For innovation to achieve its full potential, individuals need adapt to these changes by receiving appropriate training throughout their life time. Societies must also develop institutions that can help them address the inequity that can follow some innovations. Leadership in the Public Space: Cities must strongly promote “Client Relationship management” from the part of companies, and the development of social networks and informal associations and groups of users into formal economic agents, as a key to spread the influence of small companies and users in open innovation processes. In a wide open innovation scenario, where innovation is no longer the result of a process happening in a certain physical location and involving a number of people that work there, but a joint effort carried out by networks of organisations or individuals dispersed around the globe, the innovativeness level of a given system will be measured by the number of actors from the system that participate in such networks. The system governance should therefore promote the participation of its actors in such networks, which implies well educated and well technologically equipped individuals but also the creation of strong sub-networks that can ensure a multiplying effect. Most governments influence innovation through funding of public laboratories, university research and in house industry research. They also enhance the flow of this knowledge from bench to industry through establishment of Technology Transfer offices, funding of collaborative research programmes, facilitation of mobility of staff, programmes to facilitate patent searching and other initiatives. There are also many other initiatives which can facilitate knowledge transfer, and many case studies show that the most effective mechanisms involve facilitation of personal contacts, i.e. opportunities for interaction between ‘prepared minds’ . Promotion of open innovation will require many of the same initiatives, but these will be more specifically designed to accommodate an innovation process which values partnerships rather than exclusivity. Technology Transfer: As agreed broadly, technology transfer is very important for innovation in traditional industrial sectors. An even more crucial problem is how to improve technology transfer from knowledge producers to users in the regions where small industry, with reduced research capabilities, dominates. Innovation policy should pay more attention to access of SMEs to knowledge. Attempts to simply duplicate policies from successful regions cannot facilitate the diffusion of experiences and good ideas. Cultural backgrounds, factor endowments and manpower, as well as the character of different industries technologies, should be considered when making policies for improvement of technology transfer. Within the present baseline a basic assessment of where which city stands in terms of context and infrastructure, and its level of readiness for endeavouring a give type of path - by addressing some of the components above described - is developed. But it is of course a decision of each city which path it favours for its own development and growth.

3.4 Baseline study – Conversion of the findings into work
programme
3.4.1. Learning needs, potentials and objectives
3.4.1.1 The topic of the network
The analysis of the partner cities allows to conclude that, while there area certainly differences amongst cities, there is a common understanding of the network’s core topics, in particular in its dimension of creation of new knowledge (innovation) and creation of a new identity (attractiveness). A more detailed analysis of the results for each cities clearly identifies two main clusters, as regards the first dimension – creation of new knowledge: one grouping the Competitiveness cities, and another, slightly less developed, grouping the Convergence cities, as pictured in Figure 1 below. These findings are in line with the initial expectations and with most studies regarding innovation (e.g. the Community Innovation Scoreboard).However, such a distinction is not evident in the second dimension – creation of new identity, that will reflect the attractiveness of cities to people, companies, investments… – here are the individual merits and experience of cities, more than the global regional or national context, that seem to make a difference. Overall, there is a quite extensive sharing of the topics of the project, represented in a cohesive grouping of the cities, in a relative small area of the graphic above (no “lost sheep” effect). The cities, albeit with very different tradition and economic relevance from their local ceramic sectors, share common concerns and objectives, and there is plenty of space for cooperation with benefits for all. The actions / activities listed in the table above should be regarded as valuable experience / good practice in each city to be contributed to the partnership and the transnational process of learning and co-production to be developed under UNIC. Another way to look at this is to benchmark each city against the concept of a “knowledge city” and the existence of the so-called “Urban Innovation Engines”. In recent years there has been an intensive research about the conditions which enable and catalyze knowledge development in cities and the role of the city as a hub for intensive flows and exchanges of knowledge between its habitants and additional actors. Similar terms such as “Knowledge cities”, “Intelligent Cities”, “Educating Cities” and “Smart Cities” are being used for defining the good practice cases. “Knowledge” and “Innovation” are strongly connected concepts. Debra Amidon tied the two together and defined “Knowledge Innovation” as “the creation, evolution, exchange and application of new ideas into marketable goods and services for the excellence of an enterprise, the vitality of a nation’s economy and the advancement of society as a whole”. The process of innovation becomes expeditiously one of the ultimate managerial challenges of the next decade and beyond. It is at the heart of business survival, transformation and sustainability. But, innovation is critical not only the business but also to civic domains, such as cities, and regions. The quest for innovation is relevant not only to economic sustainability but also to social and cultural life. Therefore, the creation of an organisational climate which enables and catalyzes innovation deserves special attention from both the academic community and the practitioners who leads all forms of organisations – be it businesses, cities, regions, non-governmental organisations, etc. An “Urban Innovation Engine”3 is a system which can trigger, generate, foster, and catalyze innovation in the city. Typically, it is a complex system that includes people, relationships, values, processes, tools and technological, physical and financial infrastructure. A close examination of the constructs of a typical city reveals that many of the city constructs can serve as Innovation Engines. However, not every University, or Library, or Industrial District, for example, do play the role of a true innovation engine. There is always a unique combination of intangible factors which turn a specific ordinary urban organ into an innovation engine. These factors have been described above as the principles of innovation ecology. This set might include, for example, a strategic intention, an explicit vision to use it as an innovation engine, exceptional leadership, a stimulating physical space, an urgent need or challenge, a special team. 
3.4.1.3 Deficits and learning needs
Overall, it can be seen from the previous section, to a further or a lesser extent, all UNIC cities have already started their path towards becoming “knowledge cities”, as represented in the experiences above. The goal of the UNIC project is to help them in going further into that path, in particular by sharing experiences and practices and by mutual learning that can then be reflected in their local action. Within such a process, as important as identifying good practice is to identify deficits and learning needs that each of the participating cities formulates with regard to the network’s topics. At this level it is important to know what exactly does the network have to offer and create so that the individual city will have a practical benefit and feel that is was worth the resources invested in the project. Looking at the individual analysis of UNIC cities, in the 3 considered dimensions, and bearing in mind the need to keep the project focused and manageable around a limited number of topics, there are 5 main topics that clearly stand out, as concentrating the majority of interests and needs from the partners: — Towards knowledge economy (Financing and evaluation of innovation) — Industry strengthening, (in particular through university industry relations) — Urban integration (Integrating heritage in the urban and economic fabric) — Cultural, artistic and tourism values (City marketing and promotion), and — Urban identity (Creating large scale dynamics) The table below presents and overall picture of interests and needs amongst the partners, with the goal to create a coherent picture, for the development of a proposal for cooperation. 
3.4.2 Partnership and collaboration.
3.4.2.1 Expected products and outputs.
The 5 identified topics will be addressed thoroughly during the implementation phase of UNIC through the establishment of working groups participated by the interested cities. Each working group should have between a minimum of 3 and a maximum of 6 city partners in order to keep the work effective. The objective of the working groups will be that of analysing good practices in the topic and produce suggestions for concrete actions, that once validated within the network and discussed within each city at ULSG level, can make its way into the Local Action Plan that each city will develop within the project. The overall UNIC cooperation flow should obey to some principles that have stand out during the baseline anlysis:  Local planning should address the dynamics of knowledge development and economy of intangible assets, which are very different then the ones of the traditional economy which is based on tangible goods. While there are exceptions (Pécs Zsolnay Quarter, Torricelli Park, …) in most cases it will not be possible to build nor a green field “knowledge city” neither brand new “Innovation Engines” (universities, capital markets, browfields, etc.) that may lead the city into knowledge and innovation. The challenge would be usually to transform ordinary existing (and maybe even aging) urban constructs and re-invent them as true innovation engines. The activities that will stem out of the Local Action Plans (or the “Innovation Engines”) must not become isolated ivory towers. They must be connected continuously to each other as well as be integrated in all cities’ flows. Each city is characterized by different cultural, economical and political conditions. Therefore, the specific set of the city’ innovation paths, and the form they will take will be customized to the unique urban circumstances, competencies, opportunities and challenges, that must be characterized with the support of local stakeholders. A viable “Knowledge City” or any of its components will most likely not be architected by a single professional or urban department. Rather, it will be the outcome of a collaborative process which involves the talent, insights and perspectives of all stakeholders – council officials, senior citizens, local business people, academic, artists – i.e. the Local Support Groups in each city.

"Urbact Markets
The Markets
For centuries, markets have been an important part of the city retail. They represent not only the place where people buy food and non food products but also the place where the heart of the city could be found. When retail chains where not yet developed, small retailers were the only source of products for the city. Craft shops gathered in specific areas of the cities (today’s high streets) but traders and farmers met in a specific places, the “markets”. This phenomenon could be found all over Europe in small cites as well as capital cities, the only difference being the number of stalls, the variety of products and the opening days. Because of the footfall they generated, markets had a very important impact on their surroundings, enhancing the opening of retail shops, artisans and other businesses. Even if this was more or less homogeneous in all countries and cities, the industrialization first and the retail evolution afterwards, produced a divergent path for the markets in every country and region. 
The Markets today
Although markets generate great footfall and can bring “life” to a neighbourhood, their economic and social impact has often been undervalued. Nowadays, the situation of the markets in each city varies considerably. Several factors explain these differences: retail competition, local laws, retail association relevance and roles, market governance models, logistics models, etc. The different evolution of the markets implies that different management approaches, typologies and/or degree of competitiveness can be found. But even within this heterogeneity, markets are still at the heart of the city life and play, an important role for the retail offer, tourism attraction as well as social and economic cohesion and development of their local neighbourhoods. Local governments have re-discovered or are rediscorvering the centrality of markets in their city and their relevance to urban development, their role in jobs creation and entrepreneurship and their importance for the social development of the neighbourhoods. 
Market Model
The market’s ecosystem As stated formerly, markets have a broad impact on the city. Several areas of the city GDP generation are impacted such as tourism, logistics, real estate or retail development At the same time, most of the quality of life indicators are also influenced, such as social development and integration, sustainability, availability of km0 products, mobility and employment. For this reason, a wide range of stakeholders can be identified: local and regional authorities, business, traders and retail associations, wholesale distributors, local producers, different kind of investors and, of course, the citizens of the city, especially those in the market’s neighbourhood. The attached graph represents in a very synthetic way the whole markets model and ecosystem. 
Project goals and overview.
Urbact markets is a project that aims to explore the role of city retail markets as key drivers for social, environmental and economic change in our neighbourhoods. Markets generate footfall, economic activity, increase in trade in surrounding areas, incentivize tourism and reinforce local cohesion. The project focuses on sharing best practice for creating and managing both street and covered market, either food or specialist markets. Markets will be treated as part of the urban trade and retail policy, but with an integrated approach: urban planning, environment, employment and tourism policy areas will also be part of our action plans. The project will propose specific measures to adapt markets to the challenges of the XXIst century, to contribute to answering the needs of neighbours, consumer trends and demands, and low-carbon neighbourhoods. 
Markets and Town Centre Regeneration
The link between Markets and the Town centre regeneration will be approached from three complementary perspectives: Territorial ; Social ; Economic.
Territorial perspective 
Due to their historical developments, markets are usually located in a centre part of the cities or neighbourhoods and, most of the times, an initiative around town centre regeneration implies one of the most important markets of each city. For instance, covered markets in city centres are often located in an historical environment, surrounded by historic buildings and a whole regeneration activity is often undertaken when acting on them. Some cities, especially those of the convergence regions, carried out in the last years some city centre remodelling projects partly financed through European funds that implied the renewal of some of their markets and/or their surroundings. However, the centrality of the market is not always taken into account when an urban planning strategy is being developed, possibly due to the lack of an existing body with whole competences on markets that can lead, or at least influence the urban planning of the city. However, there are successful examples in Europe of how markets can be the focal point and guideline for urban planning and positively contribute to the city development strategy.  In this context, Barcelona’s case with 19 remodelled markets and other 10 remodelling projects underway is probably the most relevant example of how urban planning and markets’ strategy can be linked. Also in other cities such as London, Torino, Toulouse, Plovdiv or Wroclaw, and with more or less intensity, markets have been integrated in the lifetime neighbourhood development and planning guidance. Those experiences show that urban planning considering the needs and opportunities of each neighbourhood and taking into account the markets as an important axis of the regeneration, is a basis for an efficient and rational development. It could include in its final outcome, the need of the retail and market sector of the regenerated area in terms of : Public transportation.  Capillary logistics.  Citizens’ and retail’s waste management. Footfall flows. Private investments to incentivize. Accessibility, etc. Town centre regeneration implies acting on functions that play a very important role in everyday life of citizens.  
Economic and administrative perspective
Many aspects have to be taken into consideration about the economic aspects of markets: A recent study made in London (London's Retail Street Markets - Final Report, Regeneris, 2009) confirmed what had already been empirically seen on different cities: a large minority (42%) of customers said they would not visit the town centre if the market was not there.  Markets are an attraction pole for citizens and, in some cases, also for tourists. The economic impact of the markets is very high (see later) not only for the market itself but for all the surrounding retail and service’s companies. Markets integrate traders with local producers, their mix depending on the regulations, wholesale availability and competitiveness. Due to their territorial and economic implications, market revivals cannot be considered separately from their immediate environment. If seen as just a “market issue”, they will be perceived as not very profitable and thus only affordable from a public-service perspective. In fact, in private-managed markets there aren’t usually big investments unless very focused to footfall increase (e.g. tourism), because in most of the cases the local authorities haven’t developed tools for its stimulation. Private holders lack the broader perspective which can justify a market being remodelling for the whole neighbourhood. Success stories in Europe are often related to a public management of the markets, especially where there is a local department focused on market’s development and management. 
The management approach to markets vary from city to city, but can be synthetized in three models: Strong public management: Markets are managed as a whole from the public sector (renting, promotion, markets rehabilitation, general management…). In these cases, a specific department or even an independent public body usually exist (e.g. Institut de Mercats Municipals de Barcelona). Light public management: Markets are managed by the public sector but mainly focused on renting the public space, not developing other actions such as promotion or markets remodelling (e.g. Toulouse markets approach, some examples in London) Private management: The city council gives the management to private companies who rent and promote the spaces (some examples in London) Even if, from the remodelling perspective, the stronger public control seems the best option, the higher the public clout on the management, the lower the flexibility to adapt the markets functioning to different competitive scenarios. Each city shaped its model according to its own reality to find the right equilibrium between broad picture and flexibility. Some even show a mixed public-private model. However, for any of those cases, having a modernised and efficient framework for the local market businesses definitely helps increasing its efficiency. 
The commitment of the stallers on the market’s strategy is also a success-proven strategy. However it hast to be done through a staller’s representative body (e.g. staller’s association) since a discussion with each staller is not efficient and very time consuming. A well established staller’s association can positively help design a joint strategy for the whole markets system. 
Social perspective
There is a general recognition, supported by studies (e.g. Toulouse 2011 study about markets) that markets, play an important role in stimulating town centres and neighbourhoods liveliness, provide a friendly atmosphere and become a place for residents to meet. A market helps building a stronger community. In fact, as seen in some cities, when a market disappears (e.g. Búza Square Market in Pecs), the neighbourhood degrades. Markets located in town centres are often the flagship of the town’s retail system, providing very high quality products and services, acting as a touristic attraction (e.g. “Boqueria” in Barcelona, “Victor Hugo” in Toulouse, etc.). Similarly, markets located in disadvantaged neighbourhoods, including some of the largest ones, play a leading role in the life of these neighbourhoods, by offering a range of food and non-food products at prices adapted to the modest budgets of many residents. In those areas with a high percentage of immigration, markets also offer familiar products and thus facilitate multicultural integration. Additionally markets create and maintain employment opportunities (self-employed or wage-earning) that may be taken up by people with low professional qualifications. For instance, and based on the mentioned Regeneris study carried out in London, there is a clear relationship between the most deprived neighbourhoods in inner London and concentrations of street markets, given the fact that street markets typically sell cheaper goods than supermarkets, in particular fresh produce. 
As has been proved in several cities, especially those with few markets, city centre regeneration increases local markets sales. This is an example of good practice to replicate in the disadvantaged neighbourhoods, reducing distances travelled to purchase the main food supplies and providing them an adequate offer of food and non food products. In fact, markets complement the existing retail offer of every neighbourhood, and for this reason, markets in the centre are much more food-focused, while on the periphery nonfood has a special relevance. In the case of cities with markets mainly focused on food (e.g. Barcelona), the phenomenon also exists but the complementary retail offer appears all around the markets. Based on these lessons, some projects such as the Urban Barriera in Torino, were born aimed at regenerating a disadvantaged and marginal neighbourhood taking into account the present market in its area. In the case of Torino the regeneration of Foroni market is paramount within the overall project, in fact the market is the most important concentration of economic activities in the area, as well as a reference point for the inhabitants of the neighbourhood. The market is thus able to influence the economy of proximity. In this renovation framework, the stallholders are open to develop an innovative management 
Low carbon economy & markets.
The influence of markets on the low carbon economy comes from two very different but complementary approaches that will be treated in the next pages.
Rural - Urban approach
• Resource efficiency approach
Rural – Urban approach
All European countries are supporting the revitalization of their rural areas through different policies and legislations. The enhancement of the local fresh food producers, reduces the logistics chain and therefore has an important impact on the greenhouse gas emissions by reducing the amount of food miles. It is related to the km0 strategies that have been undertaken in different locations. A recent evaluation conducted by the city of Toulouse figures out that eco‐commerce on the widest possible basis should save 130 tonnes CDE (carbon dioxide equivalent) per year. Supporting the existence of farmers’ markets and/or the presence of local producers in the markets, contributes to bringing the rural world to the city and are based on sustainable methods of food production. In fact, as stated by the London Farmers’ Markets association, the markets provide the hub to make it viable to drive to London. Farmers can then sell at markets and deliver to retailers. They estimate that at least 50% of the farmers would not be in business if the London Farmer’ markets had not opened. Markets are the local producers’ access door to their customers, directly or through a well established fresh wholesalers chain as can be found for instance in Barcelona or Dublin. Some regions are supporting these policies also by establishing some specific brands for local fresh products such as the development and promotion of Bukovina brand in Suceava or a recent eco-labelling system for organic products in Toulouse. However, the local products offer is limited and very seasonal. Therefore it must be completed with a broader variety of products available from the fresh food wholesalers chains that bring them to the markets either via traders, or through the local producers. They can offer in this way a completed range of fresh product to the market’s customers (e.g. in the case of Suceava, 20% of all stalls are reserved for seasonal products). 
Resource efficiency approach.
The high footfall and waste generation of the markets provides a good opportunity to implement resource efficiency policies and actions from different perspectives including freight and mobility, waste management and prevention, as well as energy efficiency and use of renewable energy sources. Freight and Mobility. Customers and stallers provide a double impact on mobility. On the one hand, customers tend to visit the markets once a week in most of the cases (e.g. Nearly 2/3 of customers in London visit markets at least once per week, over 90% on foot or via public transport), this implies a high amount of people movement. In those cities that have weak neighbourhood markets, the mobility to the central market (often in the city centre) is very high and needs a special focus from the Local Authority. For instance in the case of Plovdiv, the city is evaluating the impact of constructing new markets or enhancing the existing ones on the neighbourhoods to reduce people’s flow to the city centre. Some cities (such as Torino or Barcelona) discourage the use of cars by reinforcing the urban transport lines. Car‐sharing and bike-sharing projects are also available or under development in many cities. Toulouse have electric buses available at the city centre that directly connect to the main markets that also are well served by the underground. On the other hand, stallers also generate environmental impacts due to the whole market freight and logistics for the supply of goods, waste collections and transport of stalls for insitu assembly (non permanent markets), etc. Capillary logistics is very important for fresh food focused markets that need an everyday replenishment of their goods. However, supply is often carried out in the early morning and the impact on city mobility is low despite negative air quality and emissions impacts. There are some initiatives under study in order to reduce the environmental impact of this capillary logistics. Dublin is studying an electric tram system to bring goods directly from the port and wholesaler’s warehouses, a similar approach but using river transport is being assessed by Toulouse. In this context, Suceava and London are involved in the EVUE Urbact project to assess the sustainability of electric vehicles in logistics and (consolidated) freight distribution and to tackle the local producers as well and other market operators, involved in the short supply chain. As an additional and interesting initiative, Toulouse undertook a comprehensive reassessment of urban goods delivery systems by means of extended consultations with carriers, shopkeepers and residents. They are looking into the option of setting up nearby urban supply-chain sites in order to reduce access times to delivery routes and to consolidate products for delivery on the basis of their destinations (i.e. freight consolidation). Waste Management and Prevention.  All cities have their own waste management and recycling programs. However markets have particular requirements on this issue. A poor waste management system implies a direct damage on the market’s image as at the end of the market’s day there can be scattered waste and potential odour problems because of organic refuse and food waste. Not all markets have a waste management strategy in place, which should ideally be widely implemented as markets have the potential to: reduce the amounts of waste generated to begin with; increase the recycling rates of the waste generated; reach zero to landfill targets if suitable segregation processes are implemented, including collection of food waste and organic refuse for composting or waste-to-energy facilities. Energy efficiency and use of renewable energy sources. Markets are a cluster of activity where measures to increase energy efficiency and the use of renewable energy sources can be explored and implemented. There have been different approaches to this issue. Solar panels on the market’s roof is a very effective strategy already in place or under development in several cities (Suceava, Plovdiv, Barcelona, etc.). Efficient heating systems are also under study and development by Suceava and Wroclaw. 
Employment and entrepreneurship in the markets.
Very few data is available about the turnover of markets in the cities. The difficulty to get this information from the stallers and the lack of control on their sales, made it difficult up to now. However, two studies have been carried out in recent years. On the one hand Barcelona carried out a study about the economic impact of markets which concluded that markets directly generate a turnover of 1 million euros per year, and directly employ more than 7.500 people. On the other hand, and based on the Final Report of the London's Retail Street Markets study, the turnover of all markets in London is £430 million per year in total, representing 0.94% of overall retail spend in London. It is important to take into account that markets not only generate direct impact but also an indirect impact that has been quantified in London: customers at markets spend £752 million per year at other (closely located) shops. This represents a significant multiplier effect, with market customers spending on average £1.75 in other shops in the town centre for every £1 they spend in the market. These figures explain the markets’ potential for business and employment generation. In addition, it should be considered that regeneration and promotion activities affect the growth of interest in neighbourhoods, either those interested in purchasing or renting residential property or entrepreneurs looking for locations to conduct or start-up businesses. In the following pages, three different aspects of the markets economic impact will be covered: Tourism attraction. Market Promotion and Marketing. New business strategies and employment. 
Tourism attraction.
Some markets have high potential as local and international tourism attraction, especially those located in the city centre. In these markets, tourists can find traditional products and local fresh food supplies (either in covered or open-air markets). The high touristic potential can be seen based on the London Visitor Survey 2008, where 29% of overseas and 24% of UK visitors to London said that shops and markets are very important reasons for their visits. In fact, Borough market, Camden markets and Portobello Road market are major touristic destinations in London. The same happens to Boqueria and Santa Caterina markets in Barcelona, the Victor Hugo market in Toulouse, Porta Palazzo in Torino or the Sunday central market in Pecs. In fact city centres tend to be those with the highest density of hotels and restaurants facilities (e.g. in Toulouse 43% of the 8,600 hotel rooms within the built‐up area are concentrated in the centre town area – source: Toulouse Chamber of Commerce, 2010). Through the recent EU project MED EMPORION, Torino promoted the tourist attractiveness of the markets, especially for Porta Palazzo’s one where tourist tours to the market are held. Market Promotion and Marketing. Markets are not yet enough consumer oriented. For instance, in many cases the opening hours are the first barrier for customers when choosing the place where to buy. This behaviour spreads all over the marketing strategies and very few examples can be found of altogether promotion and marketing activities. Probably Barcelona’s IMMB efforts are the most advanced ones, with even a very sound presence in the social networks. The more structured the markets are in the city, the lower the flexibility to adapt to a so obvious demand such as the opening hours. In fact, it’s in this chapter where private managed markets outstands public-managed ones, since the lack of investment on infrastructures is then devoted to promotion and footfall generation. Some activities are found to promote farmer’s brands (as explained before) or for promotion of seasonal products. The highest competition to markets comes from the Supermarket and Hypermarket chains that offer a broader range of food and non food products, at very competitive prices and supported by promotion and marketing activities and a broad range of opening hours. To overcome the pressure of the distribution chains, there are some successful experiences such as the Barcelona’s one to offer them to be also present in the markets. All the experiences up to now have been successful for both, the market and the supermarket. Plovdiv is also assessing the potential of encouraging the supermarket chains to open small representative shops at the market places. 
New business strategies and employment. 
Markets provide a high range of opportunities for both the stallers and the retail and services businesses around the market. Markets contribute to increase the competition, externally with other retail shops, and internally between the stallers themselves, bringing to the market a high quality and pricing offer. Different business opportunities and activities can be found on all the participant cities: Serving the restaurants and cafes that can thus differentiate themselves by using “market products”. Vertical integration of wholesalers that open a “chain” of stalls in different markets to increase their margins and have direct access to the final customer. Introduction of restaurants and bars on the market’s spaces. Fostering the creation and/or development of high commercial streets close to the market. Creation of service’s businesses around the market either for the market itself (cleaning, distribution, etc.) or for the consumer (e.g. personal services). Use of ICT (Information and Communication Technologies), namely via a web presence of market traders in a platform to allow for the sale of products to take place remotely (increasing sales and costumer convenience).

"URBAMECO Fast Track Network.
Creating Competitiveness & Social Cohesion in Deprived Urban Areas.
1. Introduction
Regions for Economic Change and the Fast Track Networks within the framework of the URBACT Programme.
Regions for Economic Change [RFEC] and Fast Track Networks [FTN] are a new element to the 2007-2013 funding programmes proposed by the European Commission. The first communication about the initiative from 17 November 2006 provides the following description regarding RFEC:  A new element for 2007-2013 to allow cities and regions to work more closely on questions of economic modernisation and Lisbon and Gothenburg Agenda. Regions for Economic Change will be dedicated to discovering best practice in economic modernisation in particular in relation to projects clearly contributing to Union’s jobs and growth agenda. Fast Track Networks, which are one of the tools for implementing RFEC, are particularly relevant for the URBACT 2007-2013 Programme as URBACT will be one of the two main delivery mechanisms. A FTN is a tool to introduce best practice ideas in the mainstream through the Operational Programmes. It does not include an investment budget but aims to link projects to the finance available in the Operational Programmes approved at regional level. That is why the participation of relevant Managing Authority is compulsory and why representatives from the European Commission [DG Regio and other relevant DG’s] also participate in the work of the FTN. FTN are formed by cities and their regions [Managing Authority], working together as a pair. They exchange on an identified theme with a view to creating and implementing projects and action plans at a local level using local Structural funding programmes. In order to experiment the organisation and working processes before URBACT II is launched, 2 Pilot FTN have been launched within the framework of URBACT. 
The URBAMECO Fast Track Network. 
URBAMECO is one of these two experiemental Fast Track Initiatives, which are financed under the URBACT I Programme. Lead Partner for this Fast Track Initiative is Grand Lyon, assembling as initial partners several cities that have formed a thematic network in the framework of the URBACT I Programme [REGENERA]. The theme of this Pilot Fast Track Initiative led by Greater Lyon is the integrated regeneration of deprived urban areas with a special focus on economic revitalisation and the achievement of sustainable results and improvements in those neighbourhoods. 
Partners in the URBAMECO Fast Track Initiative.
 The following cities together with their Managing Authorities are partners in this Fast Track Network: Grand Lyon [Lead Partner] & the Prefecture of the Region. Belfast & the Managing Authority for Northern Ireland. Birmingham & Advantage West Midlands. Göteborg & NUTEK. Constanta & the Romanian Ministry of Development, Public Works and Housing. Lodz & the Lodzkie Voievodship. Wroclaw & the Lower Slesian Managing Authority. Pila & the Wiedkopolska Managing Authority. Arnhem & the Province of Gelderland as Managaging Authority. Nea Ionia Magnesias & the Managing Authority for the Thessalia region. 
Objectives of the Feasibility Phase. 
The main objectives of the Feasability Phase that laster for six months have been: to complete the partnership; to check the feasibility of this newly established partnership; to organise between the partners a further focusing and development of a precise topic for the network and to define operational objectives for ist work; to select in each member city the target areas and topics for Local Action Plans and define them in detail; to jointly developand a transnational Work Plan and an operational structure for an efficient cooperation and achievement of defined objective. 
Activities during the Feasiblity Phase. 
During this Feasibility Phase, the following activities have been undertaken: Development of an Intake Document for the network – also to be used to inform potential new partners;  Completion of partnership with 5 members from competitiveness regions and another 5 member from coherence regions; Implementation of an Intake Seminar in Lyon to start cooperation and joint planning and production; Completion of a detailed Fast Track City Dossier by each of the partners, providing structured and very comprehensive information about the city, the region and the target negiubourhood – based on a model prepared for the cities by the network’s Coordinating Expert. A two-day field visit to each of the cites and regions for detailed planning and workshops with a great variety of lokal and regional stakeholeders being involved; Development of a draft version for the Feasibility Study and a draft Work Plan – discussed, modified and then decided by all partners during a Follow-Up Seminar in Lyon towards the end of the Feasibility Phase. Development of the final version of the network’s Feasibility Report. 
Topics of City Dossiers and Intake Visits.
 Partners had to provide the Coordinating Expert in a rather short period of time with detailed “City Dossiers” which were the basis for the planning of each individual field visits. These City Dossiers have been provided an a very high quality and in great detail all information required and agreed during the Intake Seminar of this Fast Track Network in Lyon in September 2007. This refered to basic statistics of the region, the city and the neighbourhoods involved; structured information about the political and administrational system on all relevant levels; detailed information with regard to all relevant policies and programmes in the city and the region; in-depth information for the neighbourhood to be selected for the development of a Local Action Plan; a precise definition of this Local Action Plan’s objectives and intended outcomes for each city; precise definition of the expectations towards the Fast Track partnership and partners. On the basis of these dossiers, a two-day visit for each city could be organised and implemented – with a structure and topics for the joint work in each member city prepared and provided to the local organisers as guidelines for the organisational preparation. In each of the cities, the local organisers have managed to activate and involve a high number of potential cooperation partners and stakeholders from the local level as well as from the Managing Authorities. As a consequence, these two-day Intake Visits could be used to discuss with each partner the problems and potentials to be integrated into the network activities and to define over all visits gradually the requirements towards the Work Programme as well as the precise expectations of each partner with regard to the added value and the concrete outcomes of this network and its future exchange activities. 
Key results and conclusions from the Feasibility Phase.
 The most important conclusion from the work undertaken so far is that – due to the above mentioned character of co-production of operational objectives, planned activities and work plan, all of the partners believe in the added value of these results and are willing and prepared to fully support them. All partners share to very important assessments and expectations: The network and its approach is highly innovative, answers to urgent needs in all member cities and regions and the partnership in its current composition can achieve something meaningful and useful with regard to the topic of the network. All partners insist that their commitment and investment of resources – time, money and know-how – must lead to tangible results that can be applied in practice and convince all local politicians as well as professionals and local communities of the added value of this investment.There is a very clear statement from all partners that “Eurotourism” needs to be avoided and tailor-made exchange and co-production will be essential.
 Added value achieved during the Feasibility Phase.
 Even though the focus of the work during the Feasibility Phase was primarily a transnational one, various forms and elements of added value have already been achieved amongst the participating cities and Managing Authorities through the Intake-Seminar, the Field Visits and the Follow-Up Seminar. This refers especially to the following achievements and added value realised already: In each of the member cities, the Intake Visit has been used to involve a wide range of stakeholders and potential partners in a discussion of a really innovative approach – leading to new insights in all members cities and to a modification of existing plans and intended procedures. A new dialogue between Managing Authorities and local authorities has been established due to the joint participation and the seminars and the workshops during the Field Visits, creating new exchange and cooperation structures. 
The most important result: A clear focus and work plan for the network.
 On the basis of the joint work undertaken by the URBAMECO- partnership during its Feasibility Phase, the initial topic of the network as it was mentioned in the Application From could be provided with a much clearer focus that has developed over the Intake Visits in local discussion rounds and has then received its final precision and been decided by all partners during the Follow-Up Seminar in Lyon towards the end of the Feasibility Phase. As a consequence, the topic and objective of the URBAMECO Fast Track Network is not defined as follows: „Using regional and city-wide growth potentials and the active support of local residential and business communities to create competitiveness and cohesion in deprived urban areas in the framework of Integrated Neighbourhood Development Strategies“.


 URBAMECO network focused on strategies and projects that can foster  sustainable integrated regeneration of critical urban areas of disadvantage with a special focus on local economy development as key aspect to fight social exclusion.

The question of the sustainable character of growth based on modernization of the EU economy and social cohesion cannot be accomplished without taking into consideration  problems of social exclusion. This is often connected to spatial difficulties more severe in particular neighbourhoods due to socio-economic and political processes that brought the deterioration of the environment, bad condition of social housing and services, wastelands and urban sprawl while hitting particular population at risk of exclusion such as women, young people, long-term unemployed, migrants and ethnic minorities.

The object of this network is to facilitate economic development fostering integrated regeneration of critical districts and neighbourhoods prioritized and selected by the municipalities participating in the network. Their prioritization is based on statistical parameters and indicators, whose classification changes from country to country but which hardly mirrors the multifaceted realities at local level. Each target area has a diverse history of transformations, social features, geography and political conditions, that created complex and different processes of disadvantage.  This diversity is also reflected and discernible in the strategies governing territories because often, municipal administrations operate in fragmented policy domains at home which may hinder attempts of implementing integrated planning strategies as those fostered by the EU projects. URBAMECO tried to overcome this issue by setting several schemes of collaboration among the partner cities, local stakeholders, Managing Authorities and DGregio to match the aims of OP and the drafting of Local Action Plans at city level.

Since September 2007, the network works on drafting Local Action Plans addressing specific target areas several levels.

At Local level a  Local Action Team (LAT) is set up within the municipality to  interface with the URBAMECO network and to encourage and steer the top down and bottom up cooperation of different agencies and sectors together with the  Urbact Local Support Group (ULSG),  a forum  whose structure changes from city to city that include private and public stakeholders. From case to case, the MA either participates directly at the ULSG or collaborates with the LAT.

At network level, URBAMECO works on different geometries of collaborations, among MAs to understand different policy setting across EU regarding the experiences of OPs implementation regarding URBAMECO topics;  among cities with guided 1o1 exchanges and intake visits/workshops; among MAs and cities to understand reciprocal constraints and opportunities regarding the drafting, feasibility and implementation of the LAP during thematic seminars, workshops, site visit and peer reviews.

At EU level, the cooperation with members of the DG regio, supports and guide with thematic and strategic inputs regarding specific issues along the life time of the network.


Cities and Managing Authorities in URMAMECO.
1. The City of Arnhem [Gelderland], The Netherlands.


In the Local Action Plan, Arnhem wants to focus on the
question how the development of economic potentials in
a neighbourhood has effects on the overall development
of that neighbourhood and on the competetiveness of
the surrounding city and region.
Klarendal
For Arnhem, fashion is one of the economic sectors in
which the city can and wants to distinguish from others
cities. This sector in Arnhem offers many opportunities
for economic development. The city’s philosophy is to
create several surroundings/environments in which the
fashion sector can develop:
Low-cost ateliers in empty buildings such as former
military builings or schools: for (art)students and
people who just graduated.
Zones with mixed buildings for living and working
[ateliers]: for fashion designers who develop [after
their study] their own [small-scale] fashion company.
Often located in deprived areas where the prices for the accommodation are low.

More expensive environments in locations near the
inner city
A top-environment in the inner city for fashion
labels which are nationally and internationally
acknowledged.
In Klarendal, the focus is on two zones with mixed buildings
for living and working [ateliers]. The housing corporation
has the goal to develop about 40 houses/units in a
part of the neighbourhood that is deprived.They invest in
real estate [partly with financial contribution of the city
and a subsidy of the ERDF] and rent them to the fashion
designers.
Another topic is the branding of the neighbourhood and
scouting of the appropriate enterpreneurs as an integrated
part of the strategy.
It is expected that these activities [investment in real
estate and the establishment of new fashion companies]
will give a strong development impulse to the neighbourhood,
buut also to the competetiveness of the surrounding
city and region.
Sint Marten
With the Local Action Plan for Sint Marten, the city
wants to contribute to the bottom-up planning activities
of the residents in the neighbourhood which have been
started by the residents to give them an additional input
and development impulse.
For both neighbourhoods it is a fact that the economic
development must be a strong element of an integrated
approach that also includes social and physical aspects of
regeneration.

A set of actions and interventions which could stimulate
the [further] economic development in the neighbourhoods,
in combination with the social and physical field is
wished. Moreover, the aim is to attract more investment
in these neighbourhoods by public and private partners.
It is also an objective of the Local Action Plan that there
will be more residents and companies actively supporting
the new neigbourhood profiled [fashion in Klarendal and
sustainability in St. Marten].This can lead to the expectation
that there will also be more residents and companies
who find the neighbourhood attractive [lively, safe, wellconnected].
In that way, the city tries to persuade more new residents
and companies to come into these neighbourhoods from
other parts of the city and region. And finally the city of
Arnhem hopes to develop a strategy on how to translate
the experience from their city to the seven others cities
in the Province of Gelderland.

2. The City of Belfast, United Kingdom.


The target areas for the URBAMECO Local Action plan
will be the defined “city places” in the west and east of
the city. It is considered that these offer the greatest
opportunity for the development of the proposed initiative.
Some general topics to be addressed in these neighbourhoods
can already be listed:
There is a clear for a more diversified housing stock
in Belfast. It needs to be made sure that affordable
housing for socially disadvantages groups remains
available in central locations, but at the same time,
housing of higher standards must be developed to
support the aimto keep higher qualified and creative
people in the city or to attract them to Belfast.

Another important topic is to develop the city’s
capacity to produce environmental solutions for
businesses. The universities in Belfast are active in
this field and contribute to this sector as a potential
growth sector for the city of Belfast.
A further imporant topic for the Local Action Plan
as well as the exchange with the URBAMECO partners
is the challenge to keep the small-scale retailstructure
of Belfast alive in the growing competition
with the large department stores and shopping centres
on the new development sites. The „Independent
Retail Strategy“ is a strategy in the city of
Belfast which is based on the observation that many
shops have closed due to the opening of the large
department stores in the city centre. This concept
tries to support shopping streets and centres in the
neighbourhoods around the city centre.
The problem of migration will not be a special topic
in the framework of this Fast Track Network - this
should be looked at in the framework of the main
URBACT II-network where Belfast is to be the Lead
Partner for a network that deals with this topic and
has 36 months of funding for exchange.
Accommodating the growth in the city’s economy.
While the economy has expanded dramatically in
recent years, the city centre has been the main area
to benefit from this growth. It is clear that there are
opportunities for locating businesses in neighbourhoods
which are located on the edge of the city
centre (and which have considerable areas of dereliction
and vacant land). This will need to be explored
further with some assessment of what
instruments could be used by the public sector to
do this and what sort of partnerships are required
with the private sector.
In general, it is agreed that the overall URBAMECO-formula
- to do targeted market research for opportunities
of growth in the wider city and region and then identify
such elements of grwoth that can be located in deprived
neighbourhoods - is relevant for Belfast and will be
applied there in the areas which will be selected.

The aim for the „Local Neighbourhood Actions Plans“ in
Belfast is to develop such a plan for each of the selected
City Places in 2008.The research done in the first half of
the year needs to get a strong bottom-up support from
working with the seleceted communities as it is foreseen
for the City Places for Spring 2008 anyhow.
The fact that a lot of qualified people are missing in
Belfast or still leaving the city as the end of their university
time leads to the idea that a slightly different approach
to the intended market research might be chosen Belfast:
The focus of the research for Belfast might not only be place on sectors that offer potential for growth and
sustainable development, but also on specific target
groups like young creative people and how they can be
attraced to stay in Belfast - possibly with interesting
attractions and opportunities that could also be established
in the deprived neighbourhoods to be selected.The
question will be, how can a strategy be developed either
to keep the people in the city after their studies or to
attract such people from other European Cities. In the
context of URBAMECO it would need to be checked if
and how deprived neighbourhoods could fulfil an important
function here, e.g. as breeding ground and incubator
for such young people to start their careers in an interesting
and inspiring environment at low costs for rent etc.
The “top-down” element of the research will be to carry
out a land mapping exercise to identify available land,
confirm whether it is zoned for particular uses, identify
ownership and examine the opportunities for development
to accommodate the growing economy. Linkages
with both the public and private sector will be required
to determine the most appropriate way of moving forward
on this.

3. The City of Birmingham, Great Britain.


However, what is now needed in the chosen neighbourhood
is a large scale investment of capital in order to promote
transformational projects along the corridor together
with more focussed activity around local cohesion in
terms of ensuring that local people benefit directly and
indirectly from the jobs and training opportunities which
are provided by this investment.
The strategy is based around a number of key activities:
The assembly of major employment sites in order
to attract investment and jobs.
The assembly of sites upon which to provide managed
workspace and enterprise support.
The enhancement of business premises in the area.
The improvement of the general environment.
The provision of gateway features.
The provision of business support activities.


The key outputs of the Local Action Plan that Birmingham
is looking for include the following :
Job creation and safeguarding.
New business creation.
Business support to improve their performance.
Public/private sector investment levered into the
area.
Brownfield land reclaimed and developed.
Skills – people assisted to improve their skills.
Improvements to land and propery in the area
[including security], including an increased supply of
employment land and premises.
Reduced levels of crime and the fear of crime, particularly
business-related.
Improvements to the environment and key gateways
to provide a positive image and area identity
for/to investors/visitors/local community.
Essentially the key outcomes will be based around improving
economic and employment opportunities, as well as
providing an example of high quality urban renaissance
and thereby contributing to reducing the level of deprivation
in the area.

4. The City of Constanta, Romania.


The refurbishment, preservation and capitalisation of the
historic and cultural patrimony of Constanta city is the
main topic to be addressed in the Local Action Plan.That
includes the
refurbishment [rehabilitation] of basic infrastructure
of the Peninsular Area,
the creation and rehabilitation of green spaces and
the establishing and rehabilitation of one social centre.

In order to solve all the problems and threats of the chosen
neighbourhood, it is very important to draw up an
Integrated Urban Development Plan for the area.
As a desired output of the overall regeneration initiative,
the number of tourists should be increased by capitalising
the area’s historic and cultural potential on the national
and international tourist market. Another intended output
is the creation of about 1,000 new jobs.The planned
social centre will be rehabilitated/ established and 10 km
of streets may be built/refurbished/modernized including
side walks and bicycle lanes as well as 5,000 square
metres of green spaces.

5. The City of Göteborg, Sweden.


The problems in Hammarkullen need to be addressed in
an integrated way with focus on economic revitalisation.
There is a need to develop the market place in
Hammarkullen to a vibrant area with economic activity
and various public and commercial services. This is to be
done in cooperation with other deprived neighbourhoods
in their work with developing neighbourhood
market places. The development of the market place in
Hammarkullen is also to be done with an overall city perspective;
the market place in Hammarkullen is to develop
in to a place where people from the whole city can go to
visit and enjoy.
Through a combined work, with a market research in the
region and a bottom-up work with the inhabitants,
Hammarkullen can develop to become an attractive
neighbourhood and a place that both contributes to and
benefits from regional economic growth.
The number of working places needs to be increased and
more varied. There is a need for more private employment
in the area. The development of a profile for the
market place and extended services will make
Hammarkullen a more attractive place to live, work and
to invest in. The development of Hammarkullen to an
attractive area will lead to greater integration when there
are more reasons for different groups of people coming
to Hammarkullen. Economic growth, employment and
the presence of more working places is needed in order
to improve the cohesion with the rest of the city.
The feeling of anonymity amongst the residents in the
area, the weak interest for the neighbourhood and the
low involvement among the citizens and the employees
are problems that need to be overcome by the Local
Action Plan.This work is intended to increase the attractiveness
of the area through a better environment and a
sense of pride among the inhabitants.
A continued and extended work with different actors in
the City District [civil actors, organizations, authorities
etc.] is aspired. Hammarkullen also want to re-establish
the doorway meetings and to develop the system of
doorway hosts, which was a project in the URBAN II programme.
Common activities in all schools and pre-schools and
other programmes are needed in the area [youth recreation
centres, libraries etc.]. Children and young people
do not see any positive future perspectives and their participation
in Swedish society is very limited. It is intended
to continue and develop the cooperation with Kommuniversitetet [Municipality University] and the
University of Göteborg.Work with the children in the
area is of importance for the future of the area and for
the long term success for the work done today.
There is a need to fight the feeling of lack of comfort and
security in the neighbourhood. In order to improve the
attractiveness of the area, it will be important to continue
and to intensify the activities against littering and damage
and to improve the - feeling of - safety in the area.

It is expected that the planned Local Action Plan has clear
outputs and visible effects on the development of
Hammarkullen.
One desired output is the revitalisation of the market
place in Hammarkullen in order to meet the basic needs
of public and commercial service for the residents. The
market place should also attract people from other parts
of the city. In order to reach this, a clear profile for the
market place is needed and the public and commercial
services need to be more extensive.The development of
the market place is hoped to contribute to the desired
improved attractiveness of Hammarkullen.
Another desired output is to make Hammarkullen an
attractive place for businesses to invest in. The establishment
of working places in the near area of Hammarkullen
creates a greater foundation for possible visitors to the
market place and creates job opportunities for the people
living in Hammarkullen.
A desired output of the Local Action Plan is to connect
Hammarkullen in a better way to the city and the region.
Hammarkullen is hoped to both contribute to and benefit
from economic growth. A better connection to the city
as a whole could be one step towards greater integration.
 Another desired output is to overcome the feeling of anonymity amongst the inhabitants and to increase their
interest and involvement in activities to develop and stabilise
their neighbourhood.
The improvement of the comfort and security in the
neighbourhood through physical improvements in the
area is another desired output. This is also a part of the
strategy to increase the attractiveness of the area.

The city of Lodz, Poland.


The Local Action Plan for the City of Lodz will focus on
one or two selected neighbourhoods in the city centre. It
will include the Moniuszko PArk as the core project, but
will go one important step further: It will be the main
objectives of this Local Action Plan, to establish links
between the desribed large-scale investments and projects
in the city centre and the social challenges and disadvantages
of the people living here.
Therefore, it must be a central objective of this Local
Action Plan to identify elements of economic growth that
can be used to create new opportunities for economic
activities, income and employment on a smaller scale for
the inner city of Lodz.This will also iinclude ways to activate
private capital to support investment and improvement
in the area, so that the sustainability of the large
scale projects is supported by small-scale additional
incentives and development.


The most important output is the construction [on the
basis of a coherent strategy) of a new and improved
space for living and business in the central area of the city.
Currently the central area is almost empty and not valuable
from an architectural, cultural and habitant point of
view.
During the implementation of all planned projects, the
local authorities want to create new working places,
more comfortable places to live and more innovative places
for culture and art in the city centre.

7. Greater Lyon, France.


In these two neighborhoods great efforts are undertaken
to demolish huge parts of the existing blocks in order to
establish new private housing there. In addition to that
project, the city plans to reconstruct squares and streets
within the neighbourhood.

Furthermore the Local Action Plan has to address topics
regarding the people who still live there. These topics
deal with education, training to fight unemployment, culture,
etc.
Another topic is the enhancement of economic development.
This covers support for new shops, special programmes
for the inhabitants and the creation of new
types of economy sectors.The objective is that then people
who do not live in this place come here to work.
It is also planned to support people who live in the neighborhoods
to create private corporations.

The desired output inludes a local strategy for economic
development in an integrated project. This strategy will
integrate
the nursery for private corporation;
new buildings for private activities,
the creation of a new relationship between the new
economic projects and the economic development
of the metropolitan area of Greater Lyon.

8. The City of Nea Ionia Magnesias, Greece.

In general, it is important to gain more cooperation within
all these neighbourhoods. Especially the cooperation
with the municipal housing society need to be improved.
In addition, it is urgently necessary to activate more private
capital for the regeneration processes in these areas.
In Xirokampos, the municipality wants to address the
problem of
the high rate of unemployment,
the low level of specialisation,
the high rate of delinquency,
the lack in free spaces,
the insufficient identity of the area and
the low rate of participation of inhabitants in collective
activities and
their lack of confidence in publicpolicies.
Possible activities can be the development of skills, support
for small enterprises and investment in buildings as
well as in open space and housing enviroment.
In Aliveri, the local authorities want to address problems
like
the high rate of illiteracy,
sole occupation in 1 or 2 vocational categories that
are being characterised by unregistered jobs,
lack in social insurance, etc.;
unauthorised building; 
environmental problems;
delinquency and insufficient police presence and
the fact of being more or less a ghetto for the city
because of the high concentration of Roma population.
It will be equally important to change the inhabitants’ attitude
towards participation by implementing strategies
and activities that can help to establish a new trust in
public policies.
Activities implemented here might include
enhancing the rate of literacy,
helping with professions’ reorientation,
counselling support actions,
the creation of a linear park,
creating local councils of delinquency prevention,
the participation of inhabitants in the design and
implementation of activities and finally
variouos urban planning arrangements and interventions.
In Neo Delta, the problems that have to be addressed
are
the division of the area by the railway line;
the exposure to the old factories’ installations;
the insufficient identity of the area;
the insufficiency in the available sources;
again the low rate of participation in the implementation
of actions in the neighbourhood and
the lack of trust in policies.
Activities for a sustainable development of this neighbourhood
might deal with
the removal of the rolling stock and of the transhipment
spaces,
the utilisation of the building reserve,
the coordination and increase of the available efficiency
of sources,
the participation in concrete activities in the community
and finally again
urban planning arrangements and interventions.
In Prosfygika, the historic centre of the city, the municipality
has to deal with
abandoned houses;
a, lack of open space;
alack of parking areas,
an increased number of immigrants with a loose
relationship to the area,
the existence of an army camp and finally as in the other neighbourhoods
the question of participation in planning processes.
Important actions in this site are
the creation of an area’s identity,
the protection from unauthorised constructions;
the acquisition of old abandoned houses,
the embellishment of the buildings and their appearances,
initiation of street labelling,
the creation of a pedestrian precinct,
the installation of circulatory arrangements,
the participation in activities in the local community
and finally
urban planning arrangements and interventions.

One of the desired outputs is to establish a confidential
climate for the inhabitants towards the implemented policies.
It is vital to activate the population for an active participation
in the design and later implementation of the
Local Action Plans as well as in the development of solutions
in the field of the crime prevention in the different
neighbourhoods.
Another output can be the regeneration of the residential
web and the improvement of the vocational skills. It is
furthermore important as an output to establish a
favourable climate for the creation of new enterprises.
The municipality of Nea Ionia wants to establish a new
way of communication and cooperation between all relevant stakeholders which is missing completely at the
moment.They hope that the URBAMECO network can
act as a strong incentive for such a new local culture of
cooperation.
First positive effects are already visible caused by the
Intake Visit in October. For the preparation of that meeting,
a first exchange between different stakeholders has
been organised that revealed already a lot of actions that
were run in parallel until now without using any potential
for cooperation or the creation of synergies.

9. The City of Pila, Poland.

The problems that are supposed to be addressed by the
Local Action Plan deal with the identification of investment
types, cost evaluation and studies on particular
parts of the above mentioned areas.

Pila expects different outputs and impacts with regard to
its post-military areas. One focus will be on the revitalisation
project “Sport Shooting Centre”. The most important
expected outputs and impacts for all of the post-military
areas are:
Reuse of these areas for local, sub-regional and
regional functions.
Creation of new jobs
Creation of new social functions: business, services,
educational, tourism, recreation, culture.
Protection of the natural environment.
Development of new housing
Improvement of the quality of life for and with the
local community.
Increase of public safety.
Improvement of the city image.


10. The city of Wroclaw, Poland.

  
In general, different ways to address the relevant topics
in the Local Action Plan could be implemented.The City
of Wroclaw divides its Integrated Urban Development
Programme for the area in three possible levels that can
be implemented.
The first alternative could be the MINIMUM programme
which means that the city will implement
the Local Action Plan and a trade development
strategy for the commercial, service and tourist
route plus all actions that may be co-financed under
ROP [socioe-conomic programme and infrastructural
investments].
The second alternative would be a MEDIUM programme
which could consist of the MINIMUM programme
plus the renovation of tenement houses.
Finally, there could be the MAXIMUM programme
which would contain all actions presented in the
project.
With regard to different subjects that can be addressed
in the Local Action Plan, Wroclaw presents three different
levels of interactions:
In economic respect, the aim is to support entrepreneurial
growth in new areas in which it is currently highly incidental
or non-existent.With the planned actions, functionality
and quality of public space should equally be
improved.
The actions to be taken include:
Preparation of an attractive commercial and service
offer for investors, inhabitants and tourists [development
of a commercial growth strategy for the
neighbourhood], based on performed analyses, the
offer will allow for market diversity and variability –
this part of the project may be entirely financed
from EU funds under the URBACT II initiative;
Creation of new jobs for the local community;
Providing tools to support and stimulate entrepreneurship
such as business incubators, economic
advice centres etc.
Real estate tax allowances for priority investors;
Introduction of attractive, non-conventional means
of transport along the route [e.g. rikshaws as they
are already operational in Lodz city centre].
In environmental respect, the aim is to renovate buildings
and infrastructure which includes the creation of an area
with optimum spatial arrangement and appearance. The
actions to be taken include:
Renovation of tenement houses [using current revitalisation
programmes such as the “100 tenement
houses” programme, the programme co-financing
the renovation of historic monuments with the
Municipal Historic Preservation Office, it is also possible

 Urban Green Labs.

 Promoting citizens engagement in in upgrading urban green spaces.
Introduction 
In a time of continuing urbanization, there is an increasing focus on developing attractive and healthy urban environments. Making cities green and healthy goes far beyond simply reducing CO2 emissions through energy-efficiency and energy-saving measures or via sustainable urban transport. Namely, it is not only technological solutions that can effectively improve environmental performance of urban areas. The larger the cities become, the more traffic routes and environmental pollution influence the daily life of people, the bigger the wish and the need for a green environment. A city only has the right to call itself a “green city”, if in addition to adopting a “carbon-neutral” or “car-free” policy, the cityscape is determined to a major extent by living green spaces. Urban green spaces, such as parks, gardens, tree lines, outdoor sport, play and leisure facilities etc. contribute greatly to the wellbeing of the population and make a far bigger and important contribution to sustainable urban development and living than most decision-makers realize. 
Facing the challenges of climate change, the emerging Green City philosophy implies that instead of considering plants and green spaces as a cost, they should be handled as common assets which bring value from a social, economic and environmental point of view and provide a multitude of benefits to human urban populations. Urban green areas can assist in reconnecting society with nature and offer a public space for environmental awareness raising and informal education thus can play a substantial role in improving pro-environmental attitude of citizens. As communities come to value and “own” their green spaces for the benefit of all, they can generally become more sensitized to ecological behaviour, which is a fundamental prerequisite of living within environmental limits and sustainable development. Green spaces are getting vivid platforms of community building and the emerging number of grassroots initiatives (e.g. urban gardening) indicates the growing demand for community participation in the management of urban green spaces and in the design and delivery of the related policies. In line with these European trends, the Urban Green Labs project’s mission is to foster existing bottom-up initiatives targeting upgrading green spaces and to amplify their impact through new co-governance methods.
The policy challenge to be tackled by the ULG 
Urban Green Labs network focuses on urban green spaces (UGS) as multifunctional resources which play a vital role in sustainable urban development. The key importance of green spaces in making cities more attractive and liveable places due to the multitude environmental, social and economic benefits they deliver, is an increasingly acknowledged and appreciated phenomenon by European cities. 
The cities involved in the UGL network share a different set of the following key problems connected to UGS:

1. Land-use related problems: 
 green spaces (e.g. parks, urban forests) have low attractiveness and are underused due to their poor quality and not adequate functions (traditional functions do not meet new user demands). 
 green spaces have poor quality and are misused (the two factors mutually reinforce each other), therefore do not fulfil important environmental and social functions. 
 abandoned, not utilised and misused urban areas. 
 usage conflicts: conflicting development interests of different stakeholders. 

2. Governance related problems: 
 more integration is needed in the policy area of UGS planning and management as synergies amongst the sectoral (environment, economic, social) development policies and urban (territorial) planning are not perfectly exploited. 
 scarce municipal resources vs. high maintenance costs of UGS. 
 new user demands connected to UGS are not integrated within the strategic urban planning processes. 
 grassroots initiatives connected to urban greening (and also promoting community building and social inclusion) cannot have impact on policy-making as they are isolated with low capacities. 
 low level of community engagement as citizens and bottom-up initiatives are not motivated/ mobilised and/ or supported effectively by local governments to participate in UGS planning and implementation (e.g. co-creation and maintenance) procedures. 

3. Attitude related problems: 
 often not satisfactory level of awareness/ informedness of residents on general environmental issues. 
 often not satisfactory level of pro-environmental attitude and behaviour of citizens. 
 the benefits of UGS are not known and valued by citizens and communities. 
 lacking willingness for voluntarism and self-organisation amongst citizens. 
 often not satisfactory level of knowledge of the municipal staff on the overarching multifunctional benefits and of UGS. 
 a deep knowledge on the strategic benefits of collaboration with citizens, community groups and civil associations has not taken root at city administrations. 
Based on this pool of problems, the common policy challenge for the UGL partnership is built up from three interlinked areas, such as: 
1. sustainable regeneration and upgrading of urban green spaces; 
2. participatory governance arrangements for planning and managing green spaces; 
3. environmental awareness raising linked to green spaces. 
To meet these challenges, partners aim to mobilise citizens and promote community grassroots initiatives in order to blend bottom-up and top-down initiatives and boost collaborative spatial policy-making and practices and realize sustainable governance of UGS through an integrated and participatory manner. 
The below key questions will be analysed during the project within the different socio-economic backgrounds of partner cities: 
 What are the forms of efficient user involvement and methods of cooperation in the fields of strategic planning, design, delivery and management of UGS? How to facilitate collaboration with citizen groups in green issues? 
 How to channel city level green infrastructure projects towards community-based initiatives to meet real needs and reach wider community acceptance? 

 How to collect grassroots initiatives and make them meet with the relevant policy and decision makers and how to facilitate a mutually empowering discussion among them, paving the way towards collaborative UGS planning and management mechanism and more effective public interventions? 
 How to identify and mobilise key actors (predominantly NGOs) able to act as mediators between bottom-up initiatives of self-organised groups and the policy level? What kind of capacities and authority support do they need? 
 How to sensitize and motivate residents for voluntary participation in place-keeping (maintenance of green spaces) through formulation of e.g. neighbourhood groups? What kind of support is needed to strengthen self-management capacities? 
 What kind of regulation is needed to create UGS management mechanisms based on shared responsibility among the policy level and civic/community groups (e.g. maintenance contracts, stewardship agreements)? 
 What can be the efficient communication mechanisms and channels to provide residents information on the overarching benefits of green spaces and their impact on individuals’ life and well-being in order to promote citizens’ pro-environmental attitude and behaviour? 
Within their Integrated Action Plans (IAP), UGL partners aim at developing local strategies for sustainable regeneration and upgrading of UGS in a co-creative process with foreseeing co-responsibility in strategic planning and management between the policy and community level. Beyond empowerment of grassroots, partners will also address promotion of pro-environmental behaviour of the community members which is a cornerstone of newly evolving pro-nature policies. The IAPs will foster the integrated approach within the local administration as well by promoting cross-sectoral collaboration within UGS related policy and planning fields. The uptake of the innovative Green Infrastructure concept, which is a multifunctional planning tool of sustainable urban regeneration policies aiming at creating healthy, liveable cities through promoting the connection of isolated green spaces and substitution of grey infrastructure elements with nature-based solutions, will be also an important perspective.
Urban green spaces as key for liveable cities 
Green space is such a green area that is connected to urban environments. The European Environmental Agency (EEA) defines green space as “a plot of vegetated land separating or surrounding areas of intensive residential or industrial use and devoted to recreation or park uses.“ There is great number of types of green spaces such as publicly accessible parks, gardens, squares, recreational grounds and playing fields, cemeteries, street trees and planting, community gardens, green roofs and walls. 
Urban green spaces (UGS) are an often overlooked component of sustainability, liveability, development and regeneration of cities. In fact, living conditions in cities can be substantially improved by the inclusion of more public and private green spaces which are the most cost-effective supporters of a good urban climate. 
Green spaces are the most important instruments in cities for reducing the negative influences of climate change and for improving the air quality through pollutant absorption. Green spaces like biodiversity-rich parks, greenways not only provide habitats for flora and fauna in the city, but serve as fresh air corridors and lessen ambient noise. Shade of trees cool the air and mitigate the negative effects of summer heat waves. Green roofs have similar effect: the cooling energy consumption of a building can be reduced by about 20 %. Green surfaces also enhance water infiltration and retention and thus ease water run-off. Parks and (peri-)urban forests function as carbon stocks: a city tree stores 3,500 kilogramme CO2 per year which corresponds to the emissions of 11 air-conditioning systems per year. 
Besides cleaner and cooler air, the opportunities provided for relaxation and recreation also improve the health conditions of the citizens. Green spaces in urban areas can create a greater sense of community, strengthen the link with voluntary actions undertaken by civil society, and help combat social exclusion and isolation. They benefit the individual and the community physically, psychologically, emotionally and socio-economically. Community gardens and urban farms address the disconnect between the production and consumption of food and help increase its perceived value and also are efficient tools to educate school children and engage the interest of young people in particular.
UGS also bring sound economic benefits: they can create jobs and make cities more appealing places to live and work. In terms of direct financial impacts, case studies from around the UK suggest that proximity to green space is positively linked to both commercial and residential property prices, with properties overlooking a park being valued around 5-7% higher than equivalent properties elsewhere (A Brief Guide to the Benefits of Urban Green Spaces, UBoC, The Sustainable Cities Group and LEAF research, 2016).

3 The synthesis 
In the process of developing the Phase 2 application for UGL intensive debates took place between the existing partners and the “newcomers”. This fine-tuning process has resulted in an upgraded definition of the policy challenges and learning themes. This has been integrated in a detailed matrix which is considered by all partners as a basis and “engine” for the execution phase of the UGL project. 
Connection between policy issues addressed in Phase 1 and Phase 2 
The policy challenge/issue addressed in the first phase of “Urban Green Labs - Promoting resource efficiency through eco- localism” has been defined as follows: “cities can address the impacts of the environmental crisis, and contribute to reducing the effect of climate change by improving the cities’ physical infrastructure and service systems”. Connecting and engaging the local community with the municipality and its policies and initiatives, particularly concerning civil society initiated ecological activities is a crucial aspect of this challenge. Therefore, improving local forms of governance and raising awareness on environmental issues will help to achieve large scale resource efficiency interventions by making grass root initiatives more effective and to contribute more effectively to the sustainable development of cities. 
As a result of the discussions carried out in the development phase about the policy challenge to be addressed in the second phase of the UGL project, the idea that urban green spaces should be managed as a multi-functional resource will be further explored and strengthened also in relation to improving the environmental consciousness of the society. As set out in the State of the Art Report, green spaces have been recognized by all partners in the UGL project as an important condition for the development of attractive, healthy and liveable urban environments. Secondly the green infrastructure and network in cities contributes significantly to the environmental/ecological values of cities. Urban green spaces are important for citizens because of their contribution to their quality of life in general which is mainly due to the fact that green spaces provide multiple and interlinking benefits from environmental, social and economic point of view and should therefore be considered as an essential part of the sustainable management and development of cities. 
In order to foster citizens’ involvement in influencing decisions on their living environment and creating value together new governance methods and processes will be discussed and explored. This will be accompanied by raising awareness on environmental issues on municipal and citizens’ level. 
Policy framework agreed 
All cities confirmed that in their existing and future policies urban green spaces play its role in sustainable urban development due to the multitude environmental, social and economic benefits they deliver. The UGL project also contributes and will be in line with multiple EU 2020 thematic objectives which were for all participating cities a very important motivating factor to remain and to become a partner in the UGL project.
TO 5 - Promoting climate change adaptations and risk prevention and management. It has been confirmed by all partners that urban green spaces should and can be seen as an important instrument for reducing the negative influences of climate change in cities and have a role in climate change adaptation and urban resilience. This requires specific approaches for the development, management and maintenance of the green urban spaces. 
TO6 – Protecting the environment and promoting resource efficiency. The UGL project is linked to this through its thematic focus: regeneration and upgrading of green spaces 
TO 11 – Enhancing institutional capacity and efficient public administration. New governance models matched with capacity building and community engagement have been considered as one of the most important conditions for a successful implementation of the UGL project. 
Consolidated Partner Profile and common interests 
The common goal for the Urban Green Labs Partners is to improve the attractiveness and liveability of their cities through the creation and regeneration of green spaces in collaboration with their citizens. In the framework of their Integrated Action Plans Partners will address three interlinking policy challenges: 
sustainable regeneration and upgrading of urban green spaces. 
participatory governance arrangements for planning and managing green spaces. 
environmental awareness raising linked to green spaces. 

1. The types of green areas that will be tackled in the UGL project vary per city. In some cities such as Padua, Santiago and Heerlen, there are vacant, abandoned, or underuse areas – due to different historic backgrounds. These cities aim to develop policies to reintroduce these areas in the green network of the cities. What the new use will be, or how it will be managed will be defined in the co-creation process of Integrated Action Plans. In cities such as Galati, Osijek, Rzeszow, Vilnius and Maribor the key issue is to upgrade public green spaces, such as parks, forests, waterfronts or green spaces in residential areas, improving their ambient value for primarily recreational purposes. Then again, for Maribor and Osijek the priority issue is to tackle the problem of irregular use of community gardens. Finally, Salford is the only city in the UGL partnership where the focus of the IAP will be the creation of a new green area and the tree lining of adjacent streets through the involvement of public, private and civil organisations will be in the focus of the IAP. 

Although the functions to be given to the green spaces are diverse the development phase has shown that all cities in the UGL network are in a position to exchange and transfer good practices on the development and management of urban green spaces from one to another. This is detailed in the 'Learning Table' at the end of this synthesis. These differences between the cities in their use of the urban green spaces are even considered by the partners as an added value because of the delivery of new insights and approaches which could have an innovative benefit. 
2. The partner cities all appreciate that green spaces can deliver multiple benefits affecting the wellbeing of the inhabitants. All cities recognize the importance of involving citizens in the decision making process on how to improve the sustainable 
management of urban green spaces. However existing governance arrangements and in particular community engagement programmes require intensive re-thinking in all partner cities. An effective co-creation process involves a wide range of public/private/knowledge stakeholders – including civil society organisations and citizens. All actors, roles, processes, and resources will have to be defined and streamlined for an effective co-creation process. In some cases the culture and mind-set of the Municipality will need to be shifted in order to adopt a more collaborative approach to up-grade green spaces. At the same time, civil society will need to be strengthened and empowered for co-working in an open and transparent way. 
In terms of governance the ULG network includes some less and some more experienced partners. Padua’s Agenda 21 participatory process, Heerlen’s working with community groups and Community Councils in Salford are good practices to learn from. The Rzeszow Participatory budget scheme is a good example for engaging citizens. However, all the partner cities will need to focus on challenges enabling the local government to collaborate with citizens, redefining the relationship with citizens and develop new models for the cooperation. Partners foresee the need for internal institutional changes within the local government and develop new ways of communication with citizens. 
At the same time, collaborative governance of sustainable development at city level, and the upgrading and management of green spaces in particular, depends on the effective participation of civil society. In many cases it will require action to raise the environmental consciousness both of the municipality and of citizens and their civil society representatives. Accordingly, linked to the involvement of civil society actors in urban green planning awareness raising activities will be organised.
Precise definition of the Learning Themes. 
The UGL learning themes set out below were agreed by the partnership at its meeting in Maribor at the end of the development phase. The themes are combined in 2 groups. Group 1 addresses the Municipalities and Group 2 addresses the civil society and citizens 
1. Changing Municipality’s culture and mind-set to move to a more collaborative approach to up-grading and managing green spaces :
 initiating, planning and leading the process ;
 managing and monitoring the process ;
 what kind of skills and qualities are needed in the Municipality, and by whom. 
 institutional changes needed, including a governance model appropriate for each city. 
 communications between Municipality and the civil society sector. 

2. Strengthening civil society and promoting active citizenship to enable co-working between local citizens and the city administration in an open and transparent way in upgrading green spaces:

elaborate a strategy to mobilise citizens/generate initiatives ;
 identifying civil society associations and personnel (existing and potential) to work with ;
 capacity building activity to enhance citizens ability to be involved in improving and managing green spaces ;
 methods and techniques to engage and empower citizens ;
 creating synergies between initiatives ;
 building environmental awareness raising actions linked to green spaces ;
 financial models to support civil initiatives ;
These overall learning themes will form the basis of the project implementation phase. In practice they will involve activities including exchange of good practices, specialised inputs tailored to the situation in each partner city, or group of partner cities. The following table sets out the specific challenges and learning needs identified by each partner city, as well as the experience and knowledge of good practice that each can offer to the other partners.

"URBAN NOSE.
Network of Social Enterprises.
1 Introduction. 
1.1 Aims, objectives and the expected results. 
The main objective of the project is the creation of a network of social enterprise incubators that: 1) supports the creation of new Social Enterprises and the development of existing ones; 2) promotes the consolidation of towns’ social economy, by connecting the initiatives of social entrepreneurship with local development; 3) contributes to local development by supporting social integration; 4) increases the specific competences of social economy operators as concerns the creation, management, and innovation of social enterprises; 5) promotes, among social enterprises, the development of a “community of practices” for transfer of know-how. The main problem tackled in the project is the “Development of clusters of economic activity around new urban opportunities such as culture, care, and environment”, in relation obviously to the cluster of social enterprises, seen like parties that are in a position to meet the need for social services within a town area. Some fundamental keywords that will be faced and developed by Urban N.O.S.E.: 1) Creating new jobs in “non-traditional economy”; 2) Supporting the integration processes between planned social initiatives by city government agencies and activities carried out by social enterprises; 3) Developing sustainable economic activities; 4) Increasing the participation of all actors involved in city economic development. The main project outputs will be: 1) Creation of City Social Plans, which will be the Local Action Plans, seen as city social planning tools. 2) Creation of Social Enterprise Incubators, each with specific competences in relation to an economic field (environmental services, health services, sustainable tourism, protection of cultural heritage, social inclusion/cultural mediation). 3) Activation of a transnational network of existing incubators for the formulation and transfer of city best practices. 4) Construction of European guidelines defining a city standard of “social value”, to be applied to the activities of social enterprises being part of incubators. 5) Development of a web platform for creation of a specialist business plan for social entrepreneurship. The vision of Urban NOSE is to specialize urban areas in social economy. Just as there are industrial districts, our vision is to create “social districts”, i.e. specialized areas where companies, operators, institutions working in a context of market economy “along” a “Local Social Chain” are aggregated. The basic idea of the project is that social enterprises can be the engine of sustainable development of an urban area, according to Lisbon and Gothenburg agendas and their increase and development support social cohesion and improvement of urban economy. 
Synthesis. 
Urban N.O.S.E. in the European, National, and Local Contexts. 
The following pages will show the close connections existing between European, national, and local contexts and Urban N.O.S.E. project contents and related activities. Not only the solid consistency of this project with existing policies, recommendations, and guidelines, but also the huge potential of innovation, participation, and cross-cutting integration of this project are really impressive. By skimming through these pages, what a model of sustainable urban development like this one would be capable of generating in terms of local growth, employment and, above all, quality of life immediately stands out, with its concrete contribution to real updating and improvement of some current economic development models. 
15.1 Urban N.O.S.E. in the European Context.
 “Cities are home to change based on innovation, spirit of enterprise and economic growth. Economic growth is sustainable when it is accompanied by measures designed to reduce poverty, social exclusion and environmental problems. The question of the sustainable character of growth is particularly important in cities most exposed to problems of social exclusion, deterioration of the environment, wastelands and urban sprawl. Cities can register significant differences in economic and social perspectives. There may be spatial inequalities (between neighbourhoods) or social inequalities (between different groups). Frequently, disparities include both dimensions.” The natural conclusion of the analysis at European level leads to establishing how Urban N.O.S.E project is conceptually placed within EU Policies in the field of urban development and understanding the future contribution of project activities for achieving European objectives on cohesion policy. As concerns this point, it is crucial to refer to the COMMUNICATION OF THE COMMISSION TO THE COUNCIL AND EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT “Cohesion Policy and Towns: the Contribution of Town and Urban Settlements to Growth and Employment within the Regions”. Through this communication, the Commission set EU strategic orientations and defined the action fields privileged upon preparation of 2007-2013 operational programmes of cohesion policy. This communication also highlights some specific aspects of the urban dimension, which may be pertinent in this context, aspects on which the construction activity of the project Urban N.O.S.E. is based. For these reasons, it was considered as useful to provide a list – in the following sections – of the main topics highlighted by the European Commission, and compare them with the degree of correspondence of Urban N.O.S.E. activities with these topics. Additionally, the ability of the project of influencing and integrating other “transversal” topics regarding urban development, which may be included in other project initiatives approved within URBACT II, in some specific cases, was also assessed. This additional feature will ensure two further potentials that the project can use: 1) In the construction of Local Action Plans, which do not only concern the development of municipal project in the framework of social services, but have a broader scope, because these are public use services in the context of social economy (environment and public parks and gardens, urban mobility, services for access to labour market, sustainable building planning, ethical finance, responsible tourism, identity culture, fair trade, collection and disposal of solid waste, tutoring services, school services, etc.); 2) In participation and sharing of activities and outcomes of Thematic Poles, in relation to points of contact and integrations that may be transferred from and to Local Action plans of other Urbact projects. 
15.3 Urban N.O.S.E. in the Local Context.
 The evolution process involving local development policies is increasingly characterized by actions, strategies, and practices based on models of “inclusive” networks and partnerships implemented by all parties involved or stakeholders. Public and private parties (profit and non-profit), able to project relationships towards a joint project and project – at local level, in particular – consolidate multicentre systems and inter-institutional partnerships. The so desired welfare community consists of “new” actors, builders of practices and “enterprise initiatives”, able to provide opportunities and share needs. The impact of Baseline Study on project activities regarding the local aspect was essentially aimed at the two following aspects:  The connection between Local Authority and Third Sector;  The role played by social enterprise incubators in the partnership areas;  The role played by Local Action Plan for social economy in the partnership areas. 
15.3.1 The connection between Local Authority and Third Sector.
 Public-private relations, public-private non-profit in particular, will be expressed in original links, where local authorities do not only receive contributions from formal and informal contexts of the Third Sector, and will drive their development in the reference area. The experiences of “Social Enterprise Incubators” propose instruments oriented to the so-called social empowerment and a public-private model, which activates good practices and network actions. There are no doubts on the significant and institutionally recognised role played by the “local” Third Sector in social changes. Local development is strongly connected with the creation of new job opportunities (and inclusion in the labour market), of “other” entrepreneurial formulas helping local development, in particular, in economically depressed areas characterized by serious social, economic, and urban degradation. The recent policies for promotion of “social entrepreneurship” put the theory above into practice. They promote the inclusion of disadvantaged people in the labour market (do not only refer to women, young and disabled people, but also ex offenders, unemployed, migrants, and undeclared workers), and start-up of own social enterprise ideas. However, the connection between local authority-Third Sector does not always include contents and practices, which produce local outcomes. In reality, in most cases, this connection is limited to dedicated days, information campaigns, seminars, and conferences more oriented to marketing of “good intentions” of local councils than to promoting actual development actions. On the contrary, the model offered by Social enterprise incubators will appear as a successful one. Local authorities are initiative promoters, but also trainers and guides. In partnership with other local, national, and transnational stakeholders, the model supports future social enterprises in their becoming “enterprises” and identifying themselves as organisations structurally oriented to recovering, managing, and democratically distributing resources in a stable, efficient, and innovative way for common good. 
15.3.2 The role played by social enterprise incubators in the partnership areas.
 The Social Enterprise Incubator will be a physical space equipped with diversified tools and supports, which is capable to provide:  Essential services for start-up of newly established enterprises ( “incubated” enterprises);  Various kinds of consulting services (commercial, financial, legal, human resource management, marketing) for social enterprises already operating in the “market”. The Social Enterprise Incubator implements techniques and methodologies used for the establishment of new enterprises and will address them to groups of population excluded from job opportunities and to new entrepreneurial actors oriented to creating “social” enterprises in sectors like (in addition to services to individuals) renewable energy sources, fair trade, responsible tourism, free software, ethic finance, and valuing of identity culture. A general incubator purpose will be to support design, development, and promotion of local community through the creation of a network system supporting social economy. This network is aimed at providing information and transforming it into development opportunities for social enterprises, and the improvement of job quality created by them at the same time. The central role of Third Sector organizations in active policies for social services, employment, urban requalification and local reconversion, and, more in general, in the government of social inclusion processes, it suggests new scenarios where the action of Social enterprise is focused. The purposes agreed by the partnership on incubator objectives are:  Facilitate the establishment of new Social Enterprises;  Support the development of existing social enterprises;  Promote and develop a natural environment in urban context included in the actions, but also infrastructures, services, and activities, which is favourable to the establishment and expansion of Social Enterprise Incubators;  Promote the consolidation of social economy in towns and cities connecting social entrepreneurship initiatives with current local development, in order to strengthen the ability to create new jobs, support integration processes, develop sustainable economic activities;  Contribute to local development, promoting the participation of non-traditional parties in economic activities, support social integration of individuals helping the creation of social enterprises (associations, social cooperatives, etc.);  Highlight and disseminate the identity and culture of social enterprise;  Increase the specific skills of social economy operators regarding the creation, management, and innovation of social enterprises;  Promote the development of a “practice community” between social enterprises, which allows the transfer of tacit knowledge (able to create new knowledge, if systematized) for specific thematic topics and professionals considered as crucial for development in specific fields/sectors;  Disseminate outcomes also through news, forum on-line, publications, and conferences. There is also a clear vision of the role of Social Enterprise Incubator for urban social enterprises:  It will be an opportunity for those who want to establish a new social enterprise, or extend/diversify and existing one. Social enterprises can choose whether establishing their headquarters within the incubator or just become members to take advantage of its services. Incubated social enterprises will sign a specific Regulation, which defines the ways to use the incubator and can have access to a number of free and customized consulting services.  It will be a meeting, interaction, and exchange place. The incubator will be proposed as a crossroad able to ensure a space for exchanges and dialogue, promote the formulation and sharing of analysis instruments of the local context within which new experiences may be included, facilitate a kind of cooperation and partnership to form the real and virtual network used for strengthening the other kind of economy.  It will be a support system and qualified reference for those who have a social entrepreneurial initiative or those who already have a social enterprise and want to assess new projects. Qualified professionals offer their support in strategic business decisions, the definition of development plans, planning of activities, and regular analysis of results.  It will be an opportunity to be up to date in the field of social enterprise management. In fact, specific seminars are organized about: designing a business plan and market survey activities; communication, promotion, and social marketing; administrative and accounting management; project design and fund raising; financial management, access to credit and ethical finance; legal forms of the other economy and their evolution; social reporting; quality systems and corporate social responsibility; human resource management and contracts.  It will be a virtual place formed by the network of relationships, contacts, and exchanges between the incubator, its users and local stakeholders, which will refer to similar national experiences in a European dimension. These are the possible services implemented within the incubator:  Technical assistance to social enterprise initiatives;  Organization secretariat;  Logistic services (common spaces: training room and meeting rooms);  Consulting and support during start up;  Customized consulting for social enterprise development (legal, financial, administrative, management, organization, project design, social marketing, quality);  Internal and external networking;  Training and seminars of social enterprise culture;  Partnerships and connection with local development networks;  Assistance in localizing the activity at the end of the incubator period. Therefore, social enterprises will have the opportunity to find one headquarter and, through one interlocutor, answers to their different needs. They can also:  Check for (economic and functional) feasibility of their business initiative with no risk that their initial investment is too big;  Develop relationships and share knowledge within the incubator and network;  Give visibility to their initiative;  Quickly develop the skills of their human resources;  Take advantage of specific privileged channels and facilitations to have access to services, based on agreements and protocols decided by the incubator with the network of local stakeholders. The experiences of Social Enterprise Incubators proposed by local public authorities of the partnership can be a real opportunity for construction of attractive poles for all local stakeholders sharing the same purposes and local development strategies. Therefore, the incubator is considered as a job incentive tool, as one of the institutional solutions in the provision of public services, as promoter of participatory and inclusive processes for public and private stakeholders considered as a whole. The connection between then properly interprets the meaning of partnership between stakeholders at an equal level, with none of them occupying, in fact, a prominence position. 
15.3.3 The role played by Local Action Plan for social economy in the partnership areas Why a town Local Action Plan for social economy: the urban dimension in social policies.
 In urban areas involved in the project, peculiar demands and social needs appear, which may be properly interpreted and dealt with starting from the aspects and size of the town. For this reason, it is necessary to recognize cultural density, institutional pregnance, and programme importance to a unit project of an Urban Welfare System, through the definition of a framework system for social policies, which may be represented by the Local Action Plan of social services, since municipalities are responsible for planning, designing, and creating the integrated local system of actions and social services. The launching of Local Action Plan of social services is – for municipalities – the commitment to redesign urban welfare in its local decentralized and interdependent developments, in terms of system actions for coordination and support of social policies. The purpose of this institutional architecture is to implement a model ensuring the global aspect of town dimension and specificities of local needs (e.g. districts) at the same time. 
Why an Economic-Social Management Plan: coming out of residual aspects of social action.
 The purpose of the Social Plan is to commit municipal authorities in planning, designing, and creating the town system of services and social actions. However, at the same time, the Local Action Plan of social services is designed as the tool to understand town development policies from the standpoint of social needs and demand. Too often, social actions remain limited to assistance, with no real integration with training and active job policy processes. On the contrary, social actions should be included in the context of exclusion risk prevention actions and integrated inclusion measures. The Local Action Plan of social services is the tool through which the ""social"" context calls and transversally directs the following urban policies in a key of real sustainability:  Housing and infrastructures  Schools and child services  Training and labour  Urban environment  Transports and urban mobility  Suburbs and disadvantaged districts  Healthcare, assistance, and inclusion  Equal opportunities for men and women  Culture and leisure activities  Time in town. Through the Plan, it is necessary to implement a support and development policy for social enterprises, which are the best local answers for:  “Non-traditional” urban economic development;  Guarantee of social services to users/residents. It is not enough to improve social services to be more effective and operate better. This is necessary, but not enough. We need to support an overall growth of wellbeing in town, to be more open for all, more agreeable, more “socially compatible”, friendly with children, women, elderly and disabled people, and all people alone and in difficult situations: in other words, it is necessary to improve the quality of living for all residents. 
The Local Action Plan Planning Process for Town Welfare.
 Through the adoption of Local Action Plan of economic-social services, the Municipality lays the foundations to coordinate, harmonize, and support the construction process of district Plans, by adopting a specific organization model for inter-institutional Governance of the entire urban welfare system. This is translated into the identification of stakeholders (ULSG), concerted action and participation processes of organization and timing, such as:  The various institutional parties (Municipality, Province, Region, local Healthcare Units organized in Districts), in the framework of their competences, jointly formulate, implement, and assess social policies;  Local communities, families, individuals are actively involved in social policies and play a crucial role in system design and implementation;  Third Sector parties (non-profit organizations, social cooperatives, volunteer activities, social promotion associations and organizations, foundations) jointly act in planning, organizing, and managing the integrated system;  Production activities; enterprises must be invited to play a social role, with full implementation of ""enterprise citizenship"" jointly working with the Third Sector;  Labour union organizations and user protection associations participate in formulating social wellbeing objectives and assess their achievement;  Research and education, with many opportunities in urban contexts, are involved – through their scientific contribution and knowledge – in the analysis, evaluation, and preparation of human resources;  Finance and credit is crucial for implementing an efficient, ethical, and sustainable system of actions and services. The launching of Local Action Plan of social services must be operated within an agreement process shared between central and local bodies, in order to ensure a balance of powers and relationships between the various institutional parties. Therefore, the promotion of a cooperation context between the various institutional levels, social parties, and productive parties involved is a required condition for setting up and developing welfare of responsibilities founded on the main principles regarding the exercise of social solidarity rights/duties. 
16 Conclusions.
 The conclusions of the Baseline Study are summarized in the following list:  Social enterprises provide services to the environment and individuals also of global and innovative type, within a given area, operating to oppose marginalization from the society and labour market.  Therefore, the opportunity of increasing the social capital of local communities and the national and EU context, as a result, needs local development projects assigning a central and strategic role to social enterprises.  The social capital – which is Third Sector’s economy – is the real added value to local development, and not just a collateral product that produces positive effects. In any case, it is to be said that the contribution of social enterprises is not an automatic achievement ensured just by the presence within the area, but it appears as an ecological opportunity, meaning that it requires specific conditions to come to the surface.  Consolidated practices of Member States and regions belonging to the Urban N.O.S.E. project show that social economy determined and is still able to determine considerable outcomes in terms of unemployment and social exclusion reduction.  From the standpoint of transnational cooperation, there is the opportunity to refine the existing social economy models within the Member States. The diversity of models also provides Member States with a real opportunity to develop solutions, which are able to meet local features of the labour market and national legal system.  The main project items to be developed will be related to: - Promotion of social economy; - Identification and dissemination of good practices identified at the national and EU level; - Increase of knowledge level of the society about Third Sector potential for job creation; - Development of social economy model, definition of its role and tasks in re-launching depressed or marginalized areas also through experiences from other Member States; - Development of effective support systems to social enterprises, obviously first the creation of incubators, testing support models for creation of social enterprises; - Creation of cooperation and information networks between social economy stakeholders, through the establishment of partnerships and innovative operational models; - Study of development perspectives of an environment surrounding Social Enterprise Incubators not only natural, but also with infrastructures, services, and activities, which is in favour of their start-up and expansion in the urban contexts involved in the activities; - Development of new social economy tools and models calibrated on the needs of the various social groups and the aspects of the various areas, so that the development of social economy supports the economic urban growth; - Testing of regional animation models supporting social economy and development of urban areas; - Development of capacity building methodologies in the Third Sector through training of operators and management of social enterprises; - Increase of investment capital availability for social enterprises.  The expected support to development of social economy innovative models does not include the creation of support systems to groups exposed to marginalization risk, but it also aims at re-developing the local context and reducing regional gaps through the integrated approach in urban revitalization processes.

"USEAct.
Urban Sustainable Environmental Actions.
Introduction to the USEACT issues.
The focus of the USEACT project: linking “urban growth management” policy, with high quality intervention to reuse urban areas and buildings.
The general scope and aim of the USEACT project can be summarized as follows: detecting how to achieve opportunities for people and businesses to settle, in a sustainable way, in existing urban areas, without further “land take”. 
This target is expected to be met through integrated policies and tools aimed at improving the “urban growth management” planning framework coupled with implementable, sustainable urban “interventions” for the re-use of underutilized, vacant or abandoned areas of land and existing settlements, both in historic districts and more recently built areas. 
Such an approach is targeted at confronting the obsolescence of urban areas and sustaining the “urban change”, and through city recycling, also improving the city’s environmental, social, economic sustainability, to provide more urban quality to urban communities and, at the same time support the local economy in the short and long-term, to help overcome the effects of the current down-turn.
The conceptual “pillars” of the USEACT project: linking urban planning tools to the support of interventions and to the “quality” of the effects 
The scope and the mission of the USEACT project is surely wide and challenging; however, today the issues faced by the project are crucial for the European development, and in line with the most recent European strategy for sustainable economic growth and governance, defined by the titled “Europe 2020 strategy” (European Commission, 2010). 
Focusing and facing these issues correctly and effectively, defining immediately the field of research and the “conceptual pillars” of the project are the first priority. 
To help define the project scope and the issues and themes to confront in the next phases, three conceptual pillars (to be integrated with each other) have been considered. 
These conceptual pillars can be summarized as follows: 
planning framework and urban planning tools aimed at an effective “urban growth management”, with reduction of urban sprawl and re-use of urban areas; 

managerial and regulatory frameworks to induce, support, control and manage (also in partnerships with other stakeholders) “area based” interventions of urban re-use; 
specific tools to guarantee “quality” of interventions , to cater to communities’ requirements from a long -term perspective. 
Stressing the link between “urban growth management” (UGM) and “interventions”.
As already seen, the main focus of the USEACT project is to support cities (at different scales, in different situations and with different functional targets) implement integrated policies. These policies are on one hand aimed at reducing the pressure of free land consumption (“restrictive” policy component) and on the other hand, to combine such a restrictive policy with “proactive” policy components, oriented to boost interventions aimed at sustainable re-use of underutilized or vacant urban spaces with significant effects on the reduction of the demand for new “greenfield” take. 
This approach is certainly more effective than implementing an independent framework policy for the reduction of “urban sprawl” and on the other hand on policies focused on sustainable urban re-use. 
Focusing on “links” between “urban growth management” (UGM) and “interventions” and enabling them to become a clear working field for administrations can help overcome many typical problems which often arise. Some possible features of this link are shown above.
The quality issue. 
Finally, as a cross-sectional issue, the quality aspect of the urban recycling process is fundamental for the effectiveness of the integrated policies, pursuing the containment of land take and the economic/social growth in urban areas. 
“Quality” issue is a multi-faceted issue, concerning different aspects:  economic sustainability ; social aspects + community involvement ; spatial quality ; sustainability + energy efficiency: ; heritage + identity. 
In relation to this, addressing and controlling the quality of re-use interventions is a fundamental aspect both in the design phase and in the long-term, in order to also guarantee social acceptability of the possible consequences (e.g. urban densification) of UGM policies. 
In particular, when the quality issue is discussed, it is fundamental to have a fully developed evaluation framework to correctly “anticipate” the different impacts of the interventions and better address it from a long-term perspective.
3.1  From the key questions of the partners to the thematic structure of the USEACT project.
3.1.1 / Not “cities” alone: the complementarity of the partners. 
The USEACT project partners, in addition to representing countries with different planning frameworks and urban interventions management, also represent categories of diverse players with different “functions” and, obviously, size. 
This reality does not present – in actual fact – a problem of “incoherence”, but rather quite the opposite, (although the partners are from disparate countries): it is an opportunity to work on the knowledge and development of the roles’ “complementarity”. 
USEACT partnership is formed by: 
partners who represent planning bodies that have power on territories which include several municipalities (Østfold County; Baia Mare Metropolitan Area and Buckinghamshire Business First, Riga Planning Region);  partners who represent authorities governing the “inner-core” of important and more extensive metropolitan areas characterized by wider Urban Morfological Zones and Urban Functional Zones (Naples, Dublin);  partners who represent bodies located within the metropolitan areas (UMZ) but outside the “urban core” (Villadecans, close to Barcelona, and Barakaldo, close to Bilbao; however, also indirectly, the municipalities of Østfold County and Buckinghamshire, which are affected by the Urban Functional Zones of Oslo and London respectively).  partners who represent medium-sized cities, considerably self-contained in terms of the  connection between the administrative areas and the UMZ (Nitra, Trieste).  
The “complementarity” of the roles makes the learning prospective of great benefit. This is true as far as the project facilitates the exchange of experiences, typical problems and the views of the players that represent the various “roles” and “planning powers” in the governance framework whereby the UGM policy and urban interventions is developed. 
3.1.2 / A bottom-up process in the selection of themes. 
In the sphere of general USEACT themes, a framework constituting “key questions” of partners’ interests was identified. 
Based on the information provided by each partner respectively (original situation, challenges, problems, knowledge) and through the creation of a summary listing the challenges and problems, the key questions have been finally collectively drawn together (following a “bottom-up” process) during the “final meeting” (Dublin, 11-12 October 2012). 
In harmony with the “conceptual pillars” of the USEACT project (planning tools for Urban Growth Management integrated with the “management” of urban reuse processes, in a framework of “quality” control) the partners, also identified the ensuing “key questions”. These are ideally traceable to three “main themes”, but have strong reciprocal connections.
3.2  Proposed thematic structure.

3.2.1 / Planning tools and planning governance for Urban Growth Management (UGM) and reusing urban areas. 
Integrating the planning between the different authorities. 
The question of integrating authorities from different levels, for implementing Urban Growth Management at metropolitan/regional level was considered to be a crucial topic by many partners. This is the case firstly for “non city” partners with “supra-municipal” roles (counties, associations of municipalities, agencies), interested in a more efficient implementation of the “guidelines” in the municipalities. However, equal interest was shown by authorities which have planning power on the “city core”, but not on the whole metropolitan areas, which often see the neighbouring municipalities included in the UMZ or whose UFZ tries to autonomously attract new building development. 
The interest in the topic originates in particular from the idea that via suitable urban tools (capable of creating incentives and trade-offs), in addition to “institutional and technical support” (typically in small-scale municipalities), the execution of improved quality “densification” interventions could produce win-win results to everybody’s advantage. 
The partners can exchange experiences of regional/metropolitan management practices and regional co-operation to create regional strategies compatible with UGM and reuse targets. 
Develop “social awareness” towards aims to uphold quality. 
The above mentioned theme of integrating authorities of varying scale on the subject of UGM also surfaced in relation to the need to solve the problem of the often weak “social awareness” of the benefit of applying at municipality-level “higher level” guidelines to reduce land take and to recommend “reuse” intervention (with more densification) within the cities. As a consequence, a more decisive need to explain and share to a greater extent, at “local” collective level, the aims and potential benefits of the UGM policies (proposed for example by the authorities at regional level) emerged. Furthermore, improved capability to demonstrate the possibility to achieve good quality design for “interventions” is needed: several partners have revealed the interest for innovative “visualization tools” and the public communication of aims and projects, for example. 
Additionally, the need to focus attention on the need to work for the optimization of the participatory processes and create “trust” and “transparency” conditions, whilst avoiding the rhetorical mono-directional frameworks and potentially block on the status-quo, was underlined. 
Develop new planning tools and incentives for the new requirements. 
Almost all of the partners interested in urban recycling, are mutually interested in exploring the potential for innovating the technical tools of the UGM, and especially, those suited “to connecting” UGM and concrete interventions to reuse underutilized or vacant areas. Each partner, at administration level, has in fact expressed the need to advance – adapting it to the changing requirements – the traditional frameworks of the “planning tools”. 
The common discussions within the USEACT community highlighted an interest in studying the applicability of innovative instruments such as the transferable development rights. However, it revealed above all an interest in debating the incentivising fiscal tools (contribution schemes/levies, tax incentive systems) and the most suitable instruments to overcome ownership fragmentation in the vacant areas trough planning schemes. 
Moreover, partners underline the importance of considering which “tool-packages” – on a planning level - would enable a better fine-tuning control of the “qualitative” aspects of the “reuse” interventions. Such qualitative aspects, to be “addressed” trough the planning tools, refer to different aspects. 
Sustain the economic local development. 
On the subject of the urban functions to be addressed using planning tools, many partners facing the economic crisis have, as a result, explicitly stressed the need to develop specifically new advanced integrated planning frameworks (coupled with high-quality design control), whereby it is possible to promote, also in (or in close proximity of) inner urban areas, new economic activities capable to guarantee the best long-term local economic impact and employment level. 
A complementary target is also steering planning frameworks capable of bringing about long term “efficiency” and “low costs” (i.e. in energy management) at the level of private, public and environment resources: reducing long term costs and allowing high environmental standards is considered a very important element of “company attraction policy”. 
Often, existing frameworks and tools (zoning, taxes, standards, etc) seem to be uncapable to reach this target, since they have mainly induced large floor retails activities or commercial speculative developments. 
Planning the UGM in relation to transport. 
Lastly, a limited number of partners, currently involved in the redefinition of transport infrastructure interventions on a territorial level, have expressed an interest in working on the issues of transport systems and of planning regulations (density, incentives) based on accessibility. 
Despite interest from only a limited number of partners – for several partners the question of transport is in many cases is already “a given” – the theme deserves attention, on account of its substantial centrality. 
3.2.2 / Interventions to ""recycle"" urban areas: management, partnerships, funding, functions. 
The focus on the “partnership design” for interventions in UGM contexts. 
One of the main problems for the good functionality of the “link” between UGM planning and the concrete realization of urban recycling, on a local scale, relies on how effectively the “intervention” is set up and managed. The partners have, therefore, asked to specifically focus on the theme of the concrete management process of interventions. 
One of the themes considered to be greatly strategic is the “partnership” models in the realization of the interventions. In some cases, in light of the link between UGM and the interventions, the “partnership” policies could already rely on the UGM planning framework (such as in the application of “tradable development rights”). However, the partners have asked, more generally, to delve deeper into the theme of partnership (and in particular Public Private Partnership) for reuse interventions.
They have underlined this as a strategic area for the aspects which concern, for example: firstly, the partnership design (form, contracts, etc.) and the “partner” selection; secondly, the maintenance of an elevated and efficient degree of control by the public administrations to guarantee quality and sustainability; thirdly, the management of tools to attract and address the financing and optimization of the income distribution. 
Develop the capabilities of the PA. 
The partners have underlined the importance - among other things – of developing the “technical capability”, either on their own or via “collaborative platforms” developed at “supra-municipal” level, where suitable, to promote the implementation of UGM policies and the simultaneous implementation of interventions – especially (but not solely) at the level of smaller municipalities falling within “metropolitan” contexts or “regional” areas. 
Improving this capability implies to develop internal administrative capacity (i.e. in terms of culture, skills, expertise and technical support structure, etc.) to better manage the planning development processes and guarantee quality projects, to avoid instances of “weak public initiative” or “excessive weakness” of a private developer. 
3.2.3 / Refitting and regenerating buildings and areas. 
Some partners, especially those who manage contexts in which the reuse opportunities of “free” land are limited, or which in any case, have an important inhabited and deteriorated building heritage (whether it be in the historic centre or more recently built areas), have asked to focus on renewal interventions on this patrimony in concomitance with the application of UGM policies. 
This focus is to some extent partially autonomous with respect to those that have emerged as “core-themes” during phase I of the USEACT project and which are mainly tied to aspects of urban planning and the reuse of “underutilized or vacant areas”. 
Nevertheless, the theme of sustainable refitting and regenerating of inhabited areas integrates perfectly with the general mission of the USEACT project in as far as, several cities, as a consequence of UGM policies, have demanded the maximum improvement of the existent and inhabited patrimony, via integrated action at neighbourhood level, to guarantee the request for “sustainability” and “new quality standards”. 
Some of these cities are mostly concentrated in historic centres, others are in newer neighbourhoods. 
The thematic focus, already tackled (even as an independent issue for UGM) in other URBACT projects enables us in any case to benefit from diverse spill-over derived from the core themes in the USEACT project. 
Principal USEACT themes commonly include: the trial of new incentivising tools; managing the exchange between multiple proprietors; the ability to “persuade” and “draw in” the local community, and external sponsors also; the “internalization” in the short-term decisions of the long-term economic advantages of energy conservation; managing the “quality” control of the interventions (typically on heritage and public spaces); the need to work on the plan not only of the physical intervention but also of social regeneration, etc. However, they are applied to particular contexts such as residential blocks or inhabited historic neighbourhoods. 
Focus on the “economic activities” again. 
With reference to the historic centres, several partners have specifically underlined how due to the historic character and nature of the city centre and the challenges this creates in regard to development management and forward planning, it is difficult to adapt historic buildings (especially) for use by enterprises. There is a lack of public and political awareness about the vital contribution the re-use of buildings can make to employment creation and the strengthening of urban neighbourhoods. Many partners are interested in achieving enterprise in the city centre by reusing historic buildings and places in an appropriate manner and promoting both the residential and enterprise (sustainable for both living and working) in older, historic buildings.

"USER.
Changes and conflicts in using public spaces.

1.1. Understanding USERs approach 
This initial section is somehow a “presentation” of the main assumptions adopted by USER. USER project is focused in public space. Public space can be considered to be more than just the physical space owned by the state based on property regulations. It is the space owned by all, and which, from a socio cultural point of view, is the community expression of the contact and communion among individuals. As a spatial embodiment of the community, the ‘public’ can then emerge spontaneously from the natural dynamics of the city and the behaviour of people, conferring such a characteristic on spaces that were not planned as such. The multiple dimension of urban space can, therefore, be appreciated not only in the quality of its physical form but also, in the intensity and quality of the social relations it facilitates, in its potential to make groups and individuals interact, and in its capacity to encourage symbolic identification. The initial assumptions of USER are how to make a more liveable city in a context where cities: Have to manage a growing cultural diversity,HShould be adapted to an ageing population, Should save and reduce energy consumption,SAre challenged by social exclusion, segregation and social polarization. New urban configuration, the arrival of new inhabitants, new visitors and tourists, the new social and generational relations in the neighbourhoods and communities, the incompatibility /compatibility and conflicts of how public space is used in different urban areas are becoming a current phenomenon in our European cities. Therefore, urban public spaces are the place of a growing range of different uses with constant changes and conflict risks that are challenging the idea of a public space owned by all and where citizenship is exercised. 
Changes and conflicts in urban public spaces is the core theme where USER is focused and in turn it is disaggregated or organized in three sub-themes: Dysfunctions and conflict of uses in the public space • Unsafe (lack of security) public spaces. Management of public space. a) Dysfunctions and conflict of uses in the public space. What kind of changes, dysfunctions and conflicts in urban public spaces should be addressed ?  Conflicts between residential, commercial, touristic uses; Conflicts on schedule of uses (night time / day time) ; Different ways of displacement and transport, vehicles, pedestrians ; Intergenerational conflicts of uses ; Conflict of uses linked to social diversity and new immigrants in the public space ; Temporary uses of empty public spaces ; Private, public and hybrid ownership, Ambiguity of uses ; Homeless and other excluded populations using the public space ; Gender conflict and gender needs in using the public space ; Resident’s interests vs. newcomers or new uses. Nimbyism ; Others ... b) Unsafe (lack of security) public spaces. What kind of insecurity should be addressed ? Spaces that produce anxiety and fear, inhospitable places ; Lighting in public space ; Closed spaces /opened spaces. Flows and circulation obstacles ; Crime and violence ; Uncivil behaviours ; Obstacles to keep order ; Threats for women in the public space ; Isolation and lack of uses of urban areas and spaces ; Others ... c) Management of public space. What kind of management issues should be addressed ? Daily cleaning ; Maintenance of spaces ; Domestic waste management ; Urban furniture maintenance ; Upgrading public spaces ; Renewal of public spaces ; Others ... USER is focused in these themes and sub-themes and it is going to launch an experimentation based in this framework. A core USERs idea is that the design of urban public spaces and the main goals of urban planning are questioned by the rapid changes that are taking place in the city uses. New trends in how public spaces are used, what are the new user’s needs, increasing dysfunctions and conflicts among uses, etc., are questioning the way the city is usually “produced”, designed and managed. All the partners involved in USER will analyse and interpret main challenges regarding conflict, changes and evolution of public spaces in their cities. They are going to analyze the current uses of these public spaces, the kind of conflicts that are taking place and the categories of users than are using those places. This approach entails a process of user’s involvement as a crucial dimension of the whole process. Because “users practical knowledge” is one of the main inputs to understand how the spaces are used and what kind of conflicts are taking place. That’s why each city participating in USER will build a local partnership with the “user’s community” and a local experimentation to evaluate uses, to propose improvement in uses, and to link this evaluation of uses with the daily maintenance, the designing and planning of public spaces. This cycle entails a new and renovated approach to ensure coherence between the real life of public spaces through the practical knowledge of diverse users, the daily management and maintenance and the public space design. The USER experimentation takes relevant factors into account, trying to link practical proposals to improve uses of public spaces, with general policies and institutional frameworks like the following: Ownership of public space (public, private, semi-public) is a very important factor which can be a restriction to the diversification of public space uses. Not always ownership and uses of urban spaces are in coherence and several aspects should be solved to remove the obstacles that different ownerships can impact in the improvement or regeneration of public spaces.tUrban public policies with impact in public spaces. Several public policies have direct links with public space: transport and mobility, urban planning, social services, environment, cleaning and maintenance, tourism and economic development...., among others. The improvement of public spaces and the overcoming of conflicts and dysfunctions are influenced by these policies.  Metropolitan governance. The territorial governance is a key issue considering the differences between the functional, the morphological and the administrative boundaries. The scales and levels of administrative governments don’t meet those “real” boundaries. Planning should be shifted to the correct functional geographical level. Mobility entails flows (social and economic) that cross cut the different “spaces”. A new way of governing our cities and our public spaces is required. People using public spaces in a city, are not only resident people. Users belong to different levels of the metropolitan city. Financing aspects (investments, renewal and maintenance costs). Availability of financial resources and public budget is always a constraint to face public spaces. Coherence between the proposals to improve public spaces and the available financial resources should be ensured. The USER experimentation should demonstrate that a new way to deal with public spaces uses and users should allow a lower cost of maintenance and cleaning of public spaces and increase the sustainability of public investments. In the context of the current economic crisis this becomes a crucial point. Urban planning and public spaces. The guidelines of territorial planning, at regional and urban level, have a clear impact in how public spaces are considered and how the articulation and coexistence of functions and uses should be understood. If urban sprawl approach is the main urban strategy or if the compact city model prevails will have different impacts in the role and function of public space. Zoning will have a relevant importance for public spaces too.  
2. SYNTHESIS. 
This synthesis highlights the relation between the critical themes regarding changes and conflicts in public spaces, the USERs approach and the reality and priorities of each partner city. During the development phase and specifically, during the last Malaga seminar, all the involved cities (October 18th and 19th) partners established a common strategy to value their experimentations on the public space and to facilitate learning’s as an output of networking. This synthesis as the assembling of partners profile with the conceptual framework (state of the art) has been a process that concludes with a final and shared reflection among the partners during the Malaga meeting. During the development phase USER partner’s cities increased their awareness on the nature of the public space concept and of the diverse dimensions included. This wasn’t absolutely clear at the early stage of the project. Progressively cities improved their focus on the issue. The public space use as a core problematic supposes shifting the view of local authorities, because different municipal policies (urbanism, social inclusion, transport, security…) should serve a new and complex “public space paradigm” where physical dimension or urban quality is just a partial aspect of a more ambitious, comprehensive and relevant idea of what public space really means. We have to start from the concept of “convivial public space” that is something more than just arenas in which people can have a jolly good time; they are at the heart of democratic living and are one of the few remaining focus where we can encounter difference and learn to understand and tolerate other people. Without good urban public spaces, we are likely to drift into an increasingly privatized and polarized society, with all its concomitant problems. Despite some improvements in urban development during the last couple of decades, we still produce many tracts of soulless urban fabric that may deliver the basic functional requirements of shelter, work and leisure but are socially unsustainable and likely generators of future problems. Such places should consist of a rich, vibrant, mixed-use environment that does not die at night or at weekends and is visually stimulating and attractive to residents and visitors alike. Public spaces have a huge symbolic value. Their quality and uses reflect the recognition that public policy refers to the user, the citizen. Public spaces are the receptacle of the society with its qualities and dysfunctions. The challenge for these areas is to make places generating shared values and to make them a “common good”, not limited to a value of consumption but to ownership, sharing and citizenship. This cannot be done without the expertise of the users. In a period of crisis, generating social problems and declining resources, the USER approach is looking for efficiency and sustainability. 
3.1. Dimensions of USER topic. 
This core idea of the public space concept has reshaping in a common direction the partner’s cities local projects. The state of the art of the public space issue, and the first USERs definition in terms of sub-themes, has allowed the partners profile preparation focused in public space and in the main associated problems (uses, conflicts, dysfunctions, insecurity, management and maintenance…). If we look to the 9 partners profile we can observe this lace between local projects and thematic framework. Through the “partners profile” section, city partners have already defined, an initial analysis of their local contexts and their main challenges regarding public spaces uses and users. Taking the subthemes and the theme of USER into account and considering the different elements that where already mentioned and pointed during this document, the partners profile show that the different cities belonging to USER address different dimensions of the topic: Regarding the type of urban area where the city partners are going to focus their local experimentation and their participation in transnational exchanges several types are included: suburbs, blocks in peripheral areas, historical centers and inner city areas. This diversity gives a wide panorama that facilitates a real experimentation and comparison. Different elements within each sub-theme are chosen linked to the features of the urban area. Conflicts between residents and tourists are a focus for historical centers, while non-used or abandoned spaces are more usual in peripheral areas. Regarding the dimensions of the addressed public spaces, a wide myriad of typologies is considered among the partner’s cities: squares, sidewalks, spaces between buildings, abandoned or non-used plots, greenery, forecourts (bus or railway stations) playgrounds…. Obviously, the type of solution, the obstacles to be overcome, the users to be involved, etc. are very different. Each category of public space has its own rules and challenges, and is linked to different conflicts, uses and users. Existing spaces vs planned spaces . This is another dimension of the addressed spaces. This dualism entails different ways of facing the problem. In the first case, already existing public spaces will address problems as current conflict of uses, dysfunctions and challenges for the existing urban management. This can suppose the introduction of changes in uses, the diversification of users, and new procedures to improve the daily maintenance of the public space. In the second case, in the framework of urban regeneration processes, new public spaces should be planned and created ex novo. This entails the definition of uses, the involvement of users and a preventive process to avoid future conflicts and dysfunctions. Private-public-mixed ownership and use . All the partners city are concerned more or less in this issue. Ownership can be a huge obstacle to improve the use of public space in our cities. The ambiguity of ownership in several “border spaces” in residential areas can become a difficulty to the good maintenance and cleaning of public space. In the former socialist countries the privatization of public spaces and the atomization of private owners is an obstacle to improve uses. Often, ownership and uses are not coherent, and collective uses take place in private owned spaces. Temporary uses . During our debates and exchanges, this issue became a main one. Several cities have to cope with unused or abandoned plots, that become focus of dirtiness, unhealthy or unsafe areas. Often these places have private ownership but others belong to different public institutions. These places can be recovered for temporary uses as public spaces. At least, USERS as a major dimension of the network: regarding public space, the focus of USER cities covers a wide type of users. Usually cities are concerned with a combination of spaces-uses-users. So, the user’s consideration is not isolated of other dimensions. Cities involved in USER cope with different types of users: residents-neighbors, social excluded groups, tourists, homeless, elderly people, young people, women, children, shopkeepers, NGOs, workers residing outside, temporary students, car drivers, bicyclers, street artists and musicians, etc. The USERs approach includes other kind of users that are included in the partner’s approaches, like several “field-workers” in change of daily maintenance, cleaning, upgrading works, bus-drivers, policemen, social workers and social mediators, etc. 
3.3. Goals and strategy of USER network. 
Partners’ challenges and goals will be organized and classified in coherence with the sub-themes established in the USERs framework. The theme and subthemes will give place to a main goal and different sub-goals: Main goal: Facing changes and conflicts in urban public spaces through users involvement: Sub-goal 1: More convivial and interactive social-public spaces by solving dysfunctions and conflict of uses. Sub-goal 2: Safer public spaces in a friendlier city. Sub-goal 3: Cleaner, better maintained and upgraded public spaces for a more efficient city. These three sub-goals will be the patterns for USER experimentation at the different levels. They will become the references to measure the achievement of a “good public space”. Each one will be filled with several indicators that will be built in a shared way by all the USERs partners. User’s strategy will be developed at 4 different levels. Transnational exchanges, sharing and learning. Thematic seminars focused in each one of the foreseen USER sub-themes. (Conflicts in using public space, Safety in public spaces and Management of public spaces). Sharing challenges and local solutions. USER proposes a “Peer review process”, where cities can learn, compare and generate knowledge on the basis of local practices. Workshops grouping 3 cities will take place. Transnational level should be linked to local actions in each one of the city partners. This is a key challenge. Workshops grouping 3 cities will play this role as intermediate platforms where the local issues, challenges and plans are going to be linked with the thematic dimensions of the network. USER at local level. Finding solutions to dysfunctions and changes in public spaces and mobilizing users. Local actions plans and local support groups will be launched and consolidated in each partner city. At local level, the LAPs (Local Action Plans) should be the main output of an experimentation process to test in a practical way a pilot process of improving the uses of public spaces in the city. Capitalizing knowledge and findings to disseminate at European level at the four levels the USERs central goal is the development of local experimentation processes, exchanges, learning’s and knowledge production contributing to: more convivial and interactive social public spaces by solving dysfunctions and conflict of uses, safer public spaces in a friendlier city and cleaner, better maintained and upgraded public spaces for a more efficient city. Pilot local actions and good practices to be introduced during seminars should be clearly oriented in this direction, establishing clear links between its contents and its contribution to the different subthemes. To achieve this objective, USER should play at the four mentioned levels, establishing bonds that allow measuring this contribution of local actions to the 4 sub-goals. Two dimensions should be clearly integrated in the USERs working plan: Participation of the public space users in so far as practical knowledge providers and as prescribers of needs, contributing to a good understanding of the “real life cities” and the current use of different public spaces. The impact and the functions of cross cutting elements influencing the public space uses: governance, public policies in different fields concerned with public space, financing, urban planning, ownership. Local pilot experiences, practices and knowledge exchanges, should point all those elements that condition the public spaces evolution. It supposes that different stakeholders and involved institutions in all these dimensions should actively participate in USER.

BoostINNO. Boosting social innovation.

What is its capacity to develop the quality of life in our cities?

The Boosting Social Innovation network was co-created by several members of the URBACT II My Generation@Work network, which concentrated on the lack of coherence in the job market, between what schools and higher educational establishments ""produce"" and the needs of the employers. Many experiments were conducted in real life situations called Go For It1. The partners decided that it would be worth pursuing this capacity further in the direction of socially useful innovations. Due to the innovative character of the network and the need to work together nearly all the new partners were identified and invited to collaborate from the beginning, participating in both transnational workshops and on the required documents. The examples quoted in the State of the Art document come mainly from the participating cities and demonstrate existing practices that could be developed and transferred further.
Many thanks to all those who contributed in the conception, birth and development of the network.

1. Social Innovation:
Social innovation is right in the centre of an enormous energy in Europe and on the planet, as perhaps a way to improve quality of life. It is an intrinsic part of efforts to try and resolve the difficulties of our contemporary society, with special emphasis on cities and metropolises. The potential of social innovation is enormous, as long as the right variables can be put together to guarantee success. Many mainstream strategic tools have social innovation within their aims, methods, results and funds to support these efforts.
Social Innovation is based on and its results are felt and often appreciated by citizens – the only form of natural resources, which we do not risk to lack of. It is this ""people power"" (Adams 2014) which is based on a real collaborative model, but where at the same time social entrepreneurs play a new role, not dominated by profit, but having the ambition to tackle poverty and inequalities, and the new role of local authorities ""enabling, supporting and providing the trust that acts as a glue in collaborative settings"".
We should remember, that the role of the public sector is a key in innovations of all sorts. As states Mazzucato (2013), who advises policy makers around the globe on smart and inclusive growth, innovation is a slow process, which requires patient government funding. Examples are the 'I' Phone technology (mainly developed by the NASA and the US Defence Ministry), or the pharmaceutical industry, where the US government finances 75% of all revolutionary new drugs. In all it is the role of government – says Mazzucato – to take the economy in the right direction. She quotes one of her colleagues Professor Andy Stirling: ""The more demanding the challenges for innovation (like poverty, ill health or environmental damage) the greater becomes the importance of effective policy…This is about culturing the most fruitfully cross-fertilising conditions across society as a whole…This involves collaboratively deliberating, negotiating and constructing what ""winning' even means, and just how best to achieve it.""
Stirling clearly indicates the pathway to success in boosting social innovation, which is comprised of collaborative meeting places, the will to listen, building common appreciation of values…
In analysing the state of the art about social innovation there are three possible standpoints which can be taken, pessimistic, optimistic or linking the pragmatic to the intuitive:
1.1 A pessimistic approach – processes and tools for participation and creation of innovative solutions have been tried and experimented since the II World War. The ideas of community and empowerment (Taylor 2003) have been formalised and put into practice, as have ""new meeting places"" (Wolkowinski 2001), essential elements of local social development (Seguier 1999) or participative budgets, based often on Brazilian examples. The result of all this research and very hard work on the ground has not given the fruits that were expected. The increasing polarisation between the rich and the poor is striking: ""As government services have crumbled and more and more ground in the so-called social sectors is left to market forces, there has been an explosion in the numbers and categories of marginalised and excluded people"" (Dey & Westendorf 1996). Bauman (1999) laments the loss of the agora where ""private troubles can be forged into public issues"".
Many countries have made enormous efforts to combat this sliding away of part of the society with minimum revenues or regeneration schemes, which have not breached the gap, which is widening. This seems to go hand in hand with the radicalisation of a large part of our societies, where ""most measures undertaken under the banner of safety – writes Bauman - are divisive…They sow mutual suspicion, set people apart, prompt them to sniff enemies and conspirators behind every contention or dissent, and in the end make loners yet more lonely than before"".
Does the present day extremism of part of our societies not come out of this challenge, terrorists included?
What is more, all these policies find themselves within the tension of the paradigm of the 'included' deciding for the 'excluded', in a situation of stiffening and intransigency of public and quasi-public agencies. This situation is rendered almost impossible by the not so new, but more than insistent paradigm of evidence based decisions and results, imported from the private sphere.
To sum up: ""Communities…are being set up to fail. Involvement in participation, community management and other initiatives diverts the attention of communities away from the issues that contribute to their exclusion and focuses attention away from the inexorable march of global power"" (Taylor 2003).
1.2. An optimistic approach – part of the political elites and part of the business class have realised, that the present situation can only get worse, if they do not address the problem of contemporary societies, which are in some way disintegrating. This causes many decision makers to concentrate more and more on the local situation, taking into account the inhabitants.
Cities collaborate with NGO's, progressively decentralising the services needed by the population, but in a still rather unequal partnership type of relationship. They are slowly also finding allies in ""enlightened businesspersons"" who, as experience shows, are not only motivated by profit, but are in many cases more than willing to invest their time and money in building up the strengths of the local communities. Social enterprises are also playing a growing and vital role in working, through their professions on the general ""quality of life"".
1.3. Linking the pragmatic to the intuitive - capitalising on the social innovation potential of the BoostINNO URBACT network cities, requires identifying or building pathways, which will allow the network to progress towards more vibrant social innovation based on the city eco-systems and contributing to the key elements of a Pan European model.
In contrast to traditional methods and thinking (identification of the problem, finding ways to solve it, planning the action, evaluation etc) it would be necessary to work more intuitively, as do many IT start-ups or social innovation labs by starting with a challenge.
For the network cities this could mean, that the first step would imply the creation of a framework for social innovation (processes and procedures), but paradoxically, without an owner. This would mean working and depending on the project network and our local networks. The role of the brokers (persons and institutions participating in different roles in the network) would be to help in the birth of projects (midwife role) and to give sense and content to the process. Success would be guaranteed by evolving progressively towards the identification of the owners of the process, who must be enlightened, have a sense of the public good and who stimulate the process, in this spirit and not just in their own interests.
This understanding of the present situation is corroborated by Reos Partners (Rodrigues 2014) who suggest that the complexity we face can be understood in 3 ways: dynamic in that the space between cause and effect become further apart in time and space; social in that there are more choices to be made between more people with more perspectives than ever before; generative in that the future is unknown and emergent, and we are tasked with creating the future as it emerges in improvisational and adaptive ways.
Another aspect is strongly linked to ""people power"" (eg. OUIshare4). Very often innovations are in very strong relationships with the existing status quo. This means, that many innovations are adaptations to the existing situation, and the creation of jobs and realities disconnected from practice and street level experiences (Bosschart & Biemans 2015). The mission of the recently created network Social Innovation Acceleration in Cities (SIAC) is to bring back creativity and its ownership to communities and civilians, even if it is highly disruptive. This emancipation or empowerment of individuals is underlined as central to the needed growing autonomy of citizens even if some kind of balance with existing powers has to be guaranteed (Mencwel & Wygnański 2014). This implies, that no one has the monopoly on the truth, everyone has to think and act across borders and silos, people have to share visions and purpose, to know what makes them uncomfortable and have a relationship to power.

""Social innovation can be defined as the development and implementation of new ideas (products, services and models) to meet social needs and create new social relationships or collaborations. It represents new responses to pressing social demands, which affect the process of social interactions. It is aimed at improving human well-being. Social innovations are innovations that are social in both their ends and their means. They are innovations that are not only good for society but also enhance individuals’ capacity to act. They rely on the inventiveness of citizens, civil society organisations, local communities, businesses and public servants and services. They are an opportunity both for the public sector and for the markets, so that the products and services better satisfy individual but also collective aspirations.
Stimulating innovation, entrepreneurship and the knowledge-based society is at the core of the Europe 2020 Strategy"".(European Commission 2013).

1.5 From the URBACT Social Innovation in cities workstream to Boosting Social Innovation
URBACT has already addressed the theme of Social Innovation in Cities in the URBACT II capitalisation workstream (Jégou 2015), in which many aspects of social innovation have been discussed. F. Jégou underlines, that several key questions emerged from this work, based also on other URBACT networks and the two case studies of social innovation in Amersfoort (NL) and Gdansk (PL):
What is changing in city administrations to facilitate collaboration with citizens?
How are citizens helping to build collaborative public services? What are the potential and limits of their involvement?
How can cities create the right environment for social innovation to develop?
How can cities create space for experimentation and facilitate the maturation, deployment and scaling up of social innovation?
How can cities use their purchasing power to facilitate social innovation, orient public procurement and use public money to kick-start new initiatives?
The previous URBACT workstream capitalisation Supporting Urban Youth through Social Innovation (Adams and Arnkil, 2013) indicated that social innovation platforms and ecosystems depended for a large part on the initiatives of cities, which have to facilitate the entry of ordinary citizens into these co-construction spaces and processes. Cities would thus become brokers of social innovation and would have to adapt their own governance in consequence. The report poses questions such as; what practices and roles are played by cities in promoting social innovation? What are the main obstacles and barriers for cities to promote and make the most of social innovation? What steps have been undertaken to overcome those obstacles and barriers and how can cities replicate and scale up social innovation?
As the policy of URBACT is to develop the sustainability of cities it is worth quoting R. Barbato on how he sees social innovation in sustainable city growth:
1. cities need to develop strategies and action plans that are integrated horizontally. This means designing a holistic approach that considers the different dimensions of the same problem (economic, social, environmental, physical) and takes into account all possible (positive or negative) connections and externalities.
2. Second, very often, competencies and resources to develop effective solutions to urban challenges are scattered among different institutional levels. Cities need to focus these competencies and resources on an integrated local strategy by establishing new functional (and open) mechanisms to coordinate the different institutional levels.
3. Third, a genuine integrated approach to sustainable urban development has to build on a real participatory process at local level, with key local stakeholders involved in the co-design of effective urban policies.

2. From social innovation to systemic change:
Social innovation is a concept, which has become popular in recent years. From the research point of view it could be called a ""quasi concept"" ""… a concept which … is more than simply a slogan or ‘buzzword’ because it has some reputable intellectual basis, but it may nevertheless be found vulnerable on analytical and empirical grounds. What is special about such an idea is that it is able to operate in both academia and policy domains"" (European Commission 2013).
From the practitioner point of view perhaps the most well known model for social innovation as a process is the spiral (Murray 2010).

It clearly shows that innovation comes from somewhere and is prompted, sometimes by unknown people, through their everyday needs, and often in social areas far removed from the public or innovation sectors (Pugliese 2014). A successful prompt will produce proposals, which are composed of new mind-sets, new ideas, new evidence base and very often unusual suspects16 (Adams & Arnkil 2013). However the real life test comes, when a process, a service or a product has to be tested, meaning that a prototype is built. This stage implies risk taking, experimentation and coproduction, very probably with the help of brokers leading to new delivery models.
The main actors of this change - says Pugliese - are the citizens, associations, existing businesses, and start-ups that, alone or collaborating in networks, respond to the needs of the territories by building social cohesion and resilience, protecting the environment, and developing prosperity and employment.
Maybe the most difficult level of the social innovation process comes when a prototype has to get to the sustainability level. This obviously requires adequate ""smart"" (Arnkil 2015) financial means and efficient communication. The choice of which prototype to support is a very difficult one and has to be made in a situation, where no one is sure about the boundaries between ownership and use, work and inactivity, private and professional space (Pugliese 2014).
2.1 To scale or not to scale?
Scaling implies that the social innovation will match the need, which it tried to address. This cannot mean that for example, the best pupils of a city will participate in a business week, in order to foster an entrepreneurial stance, but that all pupils of the city can have access to a different form of pedagogy. However changes in scale, in the more marketable products can also provoke meaningful change (gardening vegetables and fruit on rooftops) but may also produce conflicts; for example between producers of goods and supporters of sharing, between hotel owners and intermediaries of private rooms, between taxi drivers and brokers of private cars etc. (Pugliese 2014).
So as A. Pugliese from the Rome Impact Hub underlines, the role of local and regional authorities is vital and should lead to the creation of a systemic acceptance of social innovation within the boundaries of the public good, of which the guardian must be the locally elected authority in partnership with its citizens.

It is interesting to note that knowledge is seen as highly central to social innovation and must be mobilized together with financial capital and human resources (Weber et al. 2015). It is new or newly combined knowledge, which leads to redesigned products or services, both in the commercial and social sectors. The authors distinguish between different forms of knowledge: facts and data (know-what), experiential and process knowledge (know-how) and contact or access to certain persons (know-who). Another success criteria is the emotional link to the sponsor.
Before scaling the authors propose to each social enterprise or other innovator to answer the following questions: what are the resources needed to scale-up, which ones do we have, which partners could provide the ones we are lacking, what would be their expectations in return, can we supply the innovation and do we really want to?

2.4 Conditions for the emergence of social innovations:
Typically for social innovation, it can be asserted, that no one process will be sufficient. To achieve social innovation it is necessary to formulate and put into practice a complex (but not complicated) eco-system, involving all actors simultaneously (Sgaragli 2014). Social innovation cannot take place without convening all stakeholders around the same table, developing a collective open source mentality, capacity building in a horizontal way (shifting towards one that promotes citizen participation), adopting of new ways of doing policy, stimulating private-public partnerships and all types of hybridisation. It is also necessary to build new relationships and a reconfigured landscape, where supply and demand of social innovation can meet in order to start and scale social impact. If a shared purpose is not identified and a new set of values established, no change as to the perspective of the future is possible.
Open innovation is emerging (Paskaleva 2012) and ""it links technologies with people, urban territory and other cities and this approach is likely to be increasingly influential over the next period of time. Using open innovation for sharing visions, knowledge, skills, experience and strategies for designing the delivery of services, goods and policies in cities is effective, efficient and sustainable. However, consistent frameworks, principles and strategic agendas are necessary to optimally bind these elements together"".

3. Social innovation and cities
The specific character of URBACT networks, which are about improving the quality of life in urban areas/cities/metropolises, obliges the partners to refer very closely to social innovation as an element of city life.

Of what is composed this interaction? How does it work? In other words how do we live together? How do we find the ways to improve our lives and progress in the ways we do this? One of the keys is our relationship to nature and what the earth gives us, and in contemporary usage, this can be understood as the ""green economy"" as a fundamental element of development (Jégou 2015).
If the Transition Cities movement proposes social innovation based on individual relationships, the OCDE (2011) on a macro level, states that greener behaviour is required from companies and consumers, to ""facilitate smooth and just reallocation of jobs, capital and technology towards greener activities and provide adequate incentives and support to green innovation”. In that context, food issues … could meet solutions and make food chain more sustainable and base for green economy. Others strongly stress the need to relink rural and urban areas by achieving multilevel governance to reintroduce locally produced food in cities (FAO 2011).
Another question is how we live together in cities, which have over the centuries been created by humans in more or less structured ways. A city is in fact a giant meeting place, which through the very intricate pathways of history, decision making, wars, citizens' habits and urbanisation, produces all the conditions for creativity and public good. However the question we must ask ourselves is do the cities still produce the added value of ""new meeting places"" (Wolkowinski 2001) that many theories and experiences of urban life have shown to be efficient?
In this aspect cities and metropolises are facing one of the biggest challenges of the XXI century, which is reinventing forms of governance, which will allow them, develop and even share their acquis with other parts of the world (Johar & Addarii 2014). This is dependant on building a movement for social change and new social legitimacy, predictive power, putting into place an ecosystem of systems, contextual knowledge vs. abstract knowledge, open design, which will conclude with a new social contract, allowing cities to function in a different mode.
Governance is thus seen as key to success ""innovation must address the social rules and norms for decision-making and its practices…For many projects this issue is at the core of social innovation. The involvement of diverse actors is itself an innovative and original previously unseen social action in western societies which, in itself, makes governance an innovation."" (European Commission & WILCO 2015).

3.2 Knowledge enabling by creating good opportunities for learning:
In the My Generation@Work URBACT network the lead expert R. Arnkil (2013) presented Nonaka's model of learning as a basis to improve the understanding between the young and the systems which surround them. The same lesson can be taken for social innovation, where we see that the learning processes are vital, especially to institutions (cities), but also to persons. Nonaka's learning concept covers four different stages which all need different ""learning spaces"" – socialisation (quality of every conversation), externalisation (from the internal to the external expression or 'speak'), connection (taping into the existing knowledge in the world) and internalisation (learning by doing). The proximity of these concepts to what Tilburg has done is very close.

3.4 Social Innovations for Social Cohesion:
Social cohesion is undoubtedly one of the fundamental motivators for social innovation, as year after year problems persist. The inertia in this area is very widespread, and systems are organised to exist for ever, rather than being results or quality orientated. This question has been studied in the WILCO project on the basis of 77 examples from 20 European cities. Social innovation was found to be new and disruptive towards the prevailing routines and structures (Evers et al. 2014) in the local setting. The results of this analysis allowed the authors to identify five fields and dimensions of social innovation in welfare systems: in services and their ways to address users; in regulations and rights; in governance; in modes of working and financing; concerning the entity of (local) welfare systems. ""…social innovations are characterized by the fact that they bring together what is usually separated, be it ideas, concerns or practices"".

4. Social Innovation and citizens:
As can be seen from the numerous conclusions cited in this text, the role of the citizen, whom we all are, is central. This common wellbeing has been analysed by many. S. Thekaekara, a local developer from India, wonders whether the common good cannot be worked through otherwise than on the basis of financial resources. In an analysis of what 167 local communities think about wealth he obtained the following responses: our children, our forests, our culture, our language, our unity and our sharing (Thekaekara 2003). Financial resources are not even mentioned. He goes further to say, that he would like to work in terms of an economy of justice, or even an economy of hope!
P. Dijkstra claims, that the third sector, which includes social enterprise as the more business-oriented part of the sector, stems from the pattern of values or ""market of values"" of civil society: ""this part of the economy seeks social wealth, social riches and prosperity in a ""businessified"", individualised and socially impoverishing society"" (Dijkstra 2004). Another point of view is made linking responsibility and sustainability. Here it is the term economy of care, which means an economy of enough, enough not only for the rich, but also for the poor...
Our common culture is vital to sustainable development. Progress in developing our societies in a sustainable way means, we have to concentrate on the culture of dialogue, the culture of critical reflexivity, on the culture of authenticity and engagement and most importantly on the culture of freedom, which is an absolute condition for creativity and taking responsibility (Sauvé 2006).
The place made for us as citizens is thus very clear and vital. Without the co-construction of our societies with and by citizens in all their different roles, it appears that we will not achieve the progress and stable development, which everyone wishes. The citizen, as a group still has to find a way to become a really equal partner, as too often he is relegated to the role of consumer (therefore not too intelligent), a negative opinion maker (a hater too difficult to support) or a tester (will what we propose be accepted). The well known Triple Helix model shows this in a more balanced light, where the public, private and research sectors collaborate in many ways, so that the citizen may have a better quality of life. Many texts try to go above this level of acceptance of the citizen as an equal, but in many cases the citizen is still the object of these collaborations and not the partner.
4.1 Quadruple Helix
The Quadruple Helix model concerning social innovation, brings in the citizen as a fully empowered partner, and not the object of the innovative process:

However this is not a simple process and requires explaining, on the basis of work done for the CLIQ project (Arnkil et al. 2010), as it is not simply a question of ""adding a partner"". The key question for the researchers was whether a learning process can be instored between the different actors of the Quadruple Helix? In other words what does it mean when the citizen/user (formulation coined in this research as the citizen has several roles) joins in the social innovation journey.
The Quadruple Helix is a space for innovation, rather than one type of model and public authorities can develop environments, which both support and utilize citizen centred innovation activities. However such a situation requires a long-term cultural change of all stakeholders. In the analysis of the CLIQ project four types of approaches were identified, which are not models as such, but permit a better understanding of the complexity and may guide those who will be experimenting with different forms of social innovation living labs to achieve an appropriate mix. They are:
1. Triple Helix + users. The main goal is to produce commercially successful high tech products and services.
2. Firm Centred Living Labs (Open Innovation). The main goal is to produce products and services relevant for firms and their clients, which are commercially exploitable innovations (technological + social), public sector innovations.
3. Public Sector Centred Living Labs. The main goal is to produce products and services relevant for public authorities and the users of public services. These are mainly public sector innovations, or commercially exploitable innovations (technological + social)
4. Citizen Centred Living Labs. The main goal is to produce products and services relevant for citizens, where the initiators of the process are citizens and not as in the other categories firms, universities and public authorities.
As far as the role of public authorities is concerned, ""promoting the Triple Helix + users - model means mainly supporting the development of high-tech firms with the help of firm-industry R&D projects and financing. To promote Firm-Centred Living-Lab – type of activities means first and foremost supporting network-building of LL actors and promoting the development and diffusion of LL. Promoting Public-Sector Centred Living Lab kinds of activities means supporting the development of public service development.
Promoting Citizen-centred QH development means facilitating citizen innovations, informing and promoting participation, developing decision making interfaces and building individual capabilities"" (Arnkil 2010).
The new roles of local/regional authorities can be summarized as:
Enabler (finances, infrastructure)
Decision maker (steering, policies, incentives..)
Supporter (development, linking, information, education, empowerment)
Utilizer (develop own services and organisation)
Developer (renewing public institutions)
Marketer (raising awareness)
Quality controller (”quality checks” in co-creation
Therefore the idea of ""people power"" and the co-construction with the public authorities appears to fit in ideally with the ""conversation"" link identified by de Moor, the results of which have to be indexed and organised, so that the internal/external learning (Nonaka and transition cities) can really take place for the common good.

5. A longstanding source of social innovation – the social and solidarity economy:
Not all specialists agree, but the social economy appears as one of the key actors of social innovation. A conference on both topics was held in Paris in 2015 on this apparent closeness/confusion. The Policy Review on Social Innovation (European Commission 2013) states clearly that there is a strong trend towards the mixture of social innovation with social entrepreneurship as the main mover for social innovation and the social enterprise as the main venue. The best way to create innovations, involving people and move towards new forms of governance is to focus the efforts and energies towards alternative forms of enterprise.
The European Commission (Social Business Initiative 2011) has produced the following definition: ""A social enterprise is an operator in the social economy whose main objective is to have a social impact rather than make a profit for their owners or shareholders. It operates by providing goods and services for the market in an entrepreneurial and innovative fashion and uses its profits primarily to achieve social objectives. It is managed in an open and responsible manner and, in particular, involves employees, consumers and stakeholders affected by its commercial activities.""
In France the government has recognized 18 ""solidarity areas"" where social and solidarity economy enterprises have a major influence on the economic development of the area, as they are major employers and influence the decision making process historically through the employment of persons in difficulty, but presently through their differing economic activities.
In all these cases social enterprises are centres of social innovation and attempt to use their innovative competences to overcome difficulties, but also to work on the quality of life in general. This theme of the quality of life encompasses the whole of the given community and is a very strong motivator towards actions, where social innovation is partly the method and partly the result of the process.

At the EU level the European Parliament, the Committee of Regions and the GECES are attempting to improve the force and visibility of social entrepreneurship. The GECES is at present working to improve the visibility, the legal framework and the financial resources of social entrepreneurship, by stimulating the mainstream EU policies in this direction.
5.1 Social enterprises and their impact – 3 suggestions:
To many the impact of social enterprises is ""an evidence"" due to their very mission and the mixing of private, public and voluntary resources. However the need to measure their impact is more and more insistent, as the adequacy of their actions has to be measured with the needs and the problems resolved. To do this undoubtedly social enterprises must learn to act together, rather than individually, shifting the impact from an individual to a collective perspective (Huysentruyt 2015). She adds that real progress can only be achieved if corporations, civil society, associations, government agencies and hybrid organisations work together on a common agenda to solve a specific social problem.
Huysentruyt shows, that many social enterprises exhibit a ""home bias tendency"" meaning that they do not want or cannot expand to other cities, or even countries. ""Without deliberate efforts to promote ambitious international growth, we run a real risk that the already unequal distribution of social innovations and ecosystem support will become even more pronounced in the future"".

To conclude, social innovation in the network cities is poised to develop well, because there is already a lot of common culture among the participants, who are very motivated to promote sustainable urban policy making in a new, collaborative and participative way. The commitment is stronger as every city feels the difficulties of the present moment cannot be resolved in the same way as before. Therefore change seems to be with the network in a natural way, which should lead to efficient implementation of the mind set, methods and strategies which will be worked out, impact measurement included.";"7.txt";"7"
"VITAL CITIES.
Urban sports promotion for social inclusion, healthy and active living.

 VITAL CITIES is a network of European cities, funded by the European Union in the frame of the URBACT III Programme. VITAL CITIES seeks answers to how to combat social exclusion through the redesign of public spaces in deprived residential areas by using the power and common language of sport through innovative community and IT based urban sport actions, innovative physical equipment and better orchestrated service delivery.
I. STATE OF THE ART. 
1. Foreword: aims and context. 
This report aims to present the recent research and practice exploring the relationship between the built environment and the use of this environment for physical activity (sports) which impacts on social cohesion and healthy living. It mostly concentrates on the European level, but it also refers to a few globally relevant examples. 
2. Introduction to the VITAL CITIES concept. 
Despite the well-known benefits of physical activity on health and well-being there is a global prevalence of inactivity and sedentary lifestyles across all age groups. Governments and cities should take action to reverse this trend as it causes serious health risks, has high economic and social costs and negative environmental consequences. The built environment can both discourage and encourage physical activity. Cities should thrive for creating an enabling environment that is safe and accessible and can play a role in increasing physical activity levels of the whole population. Especially people living in deprived urban areas should be offered the opportunity and the means to engage in sport activities on a daily basis. 
Therefore participants of the VITAL CITIES network aim to enter into a dialogue and learning process on how to (re)design public spaces using the power and common language of sport for the promotion of healthy lifestyle with a special focus on deprived residential areas. Instead of bringing inactive citizens to sports facilities, public space should be turned into a low threshold facility inviting all citizens to physical activity. Opportunities for physical activity need to be created close to where people live while also creating cleaner, safer, greener and more activity-friendly local environments. 
The network has already identified five key themes to be investigated during the learning process. These can be applied as innovative, low-cost solutions for these areas. The key themes of the VITAL CITIES network are: (1) identifying community-based and/or (2) IT-based actions to redesign public spaces linked to leisure sport activities, (3) better orchestrating the services of the city to promote healthy lifestyle, (4) designing innovative physical activities to promote sport in public spaces and the (5) organisation of innovative events to promote healthy lifestyle. 
3. Sport and physical activity for the promotion of healthy lifestyle 
3.1. Key definitions and principles 
Physical activity is an essential part of human functioning and a prerequisite for health and wellbeing. The European Union (EU) Working Group Sport and Health adopted a broad definition of physical activity, which is used for the purpose of this report. Physical activity is defined as “any bodily movement associated with muscular contraction that increases energy expenditure above resting levels” (EU, 2008). This includes all possible circumstances: leisure-time physical activity (including most sport activities and dancing) ; occupational physical activity ; physical activity at or near one’s home ; physical activity in connection with transport .

Within this framework sports is referred to as “all forms of physical activity, which, through casual or organised participation, aim at expressing or improving physical fitness and mental well-being” (Council of Europe, 1992). 
In a wider social context, sport can be regarded as a common language that cuts through social differences. According to the noted social scientist Zygmunt Bauman, it is “one of the few institutions in society, where people can still agree on the rules” (quoted by Superflex Studio). This is the basis of sport for all principle, which emphasises everyone’s right and ability to participate in sport regardless of their socio-economic status, gender, and/or health condition. The VITAL CITIES framework relies on this principle and aims to capitalise on sport’s potential to overcome social inequalities especially in deprived residential areas. 
The World Health Organisation (WHO) recommends at least 30 minutes of physical activity each day in order to maintain a healthy lifestyle. This is the core principle of active living (WHO, 2006), the promotion of which is one of the objectives of the VITAL CITIES project. 
3.2. Benefits of physical activity 
Physical activity has well-known health benefits.5 Increasing the level of physical activity in Europe would lead to significant paybacks in public health as well as in a range of other areas. Researchers, for example, have shown that life expectancy in the European Region could be increased by 0.63 years if people moved more and led healthier lifestyles (WHO, 2015a, The Lancet, 2012). 
In order to illustrate the potential impact of physical activity let us consider its possible economic benefits. For example, a comparative study that looked at 56 major cities in Europe and North America indicated that more than 76 000 new jobs could be created in the observed cities if the level of cycling was increased to that of Copenhagen, Denmark (WHO, 2015a).
It is well known that sports and physical activity have a much larger spectrum of benefits than health. The Human Capital Model developed for the Active Cities Designed to Move report coordinated by Nike Inc. (2012), shows a very comprehensive overview and lists the benefits of physical activity on physical, emotional, social, intellectual and financial levels. The model was developed based on the input of experts and on a review of more than 500 research articles.
3.1. The problem of physical inactivity. 
Despite these all-encompassing evidence-based benefits, physical activity is disappearing from daily life with a shocking speed. 
Even though there are still uncertainties in terms of the validity and comparability of data, the numbers below are alarming. 
On a global scale, one third of adults do not reach the recommended levels of physical activity (WHO 2015a). In Europe in every 10 people above 15 years of age never or seldom exercise or play a sport. More than half of the population never or seldom engage in other kinds of physical activity (like cycling, dancing or gardening) (EU, 2014). 
Less and less daily physical activity becomes the norm. People increasingly lead sedentary lifestyles with rising rates of excess weight and obesity (EU, 2014, WHO 2015a). According to estimates, between 40 and 60% of the EU population leads sedentary lifestyles (EU, 2008). 
It is a global phenomenon for which people and cities pay a high price. Not just people’s lives are at risk, but the economic and social competitiveness of cities, too. This problem is a cyclic one, meaning that the costs and consequences of physical inactivity are passed forward through generations, until we find a way to stop it (Lee et. al., 2012). 
4. The challenge of tackling inactivity for cities. 
Some of the causes for physical inactivity lie in the urbanisation process and in lifestyle-related changes. “Local environments have become less and less conducive to physical activity. Through decisions impacting urban design, land use and transport, societies have become increasingly car-friendly over time. The growing geographical separation of living and working led to a decline in walking and cycling” (WHO, 2015a). Moreover, the safety of roads in many cases is also a concern that decreases the level of active transportation. Another contributing factor to this decline could be the increasingly ubiquitous nature of technology and entertainment. 
Participation in organised sports is also shrinking, as well as the presence at traditional places of practicing sport, like sport halls and sport clubs (EU, 2014). Parallel to that trend, as the inner city areas are gradually developed, newly built big sport facilities are increasingly built in the outskirts, lending these facilities largely inaccessible.
In many cases sports and urban design are not treated in a cross-sectorial way. Sport city officials do not regularly consult with planning officials. Moreover, when it comes to urban planning, sport politicians are treated as of secondary importance (Valle-Kompier, 2013). 
On the other hand the urban environment provides opportunities for physical activity. As Bjarke Ingels comments in the My Playground documentary: “life in the city is constantly evolving and it is our job as architects to make sure that our opportunities for expression are not limited, and that our cities match the life we want to live”. This documentary brings together architects and city planners, politicians with professional freerunners to comment on the relationship of movement and urban space. It shows how the city can be turned into a playground, with its limits constantly challenged. Of course freerunning is not the most prevalent urban sport, yet it is a great example that shows how new emerging sport types are expanding the boundaries of the city. 
The economic crisis led to the complete reconsideration of the management of shared resources. Parallel to that trend broad movements of citizens have become actors in reclaiming public spaces as a counter-balancing act towards privatization and unbalanced use of public spaces. This global phenomenon has also many examples related to sports and physical activity. Clear illustrations for this are reconquering space for active transportation (Critical Mass movements, No Car Days, PARKing Days, Ciclovias), urban guerrilla gardening and turning unoccupied brownfields into active recreation spaces, like in the famous case of the Tempeholf airport in Berlin, or the autonomous use of small spaces left over after planning where other independent sports related activities may take place. These examples are reinventing the rules of city making as they are challenging some basic urban planning mindsets. They make the most of limited available resources and reshape the very notion and our stance towards urban commons (traditionally defined as spaces and resources that is shared and accessible by everyone). These projects, movements and initiatives even if they are small-scale or spontaneous are reclaiming urban commons and are also reconfiguring the urban ecosystem (Ferguson, 2014). As a result they all pursue a more sustainable, resilient version of community building. Architects and planners and city officials need to respond to this trend. 
In terms of funding this could mean that city officials need to find ways to sustain these auto-organised initiatives delivered by civil society actors (like NGOs, associations, simple citizen initiatives). This would enable for encouraging small-scale sports activities and facilities co-created with the community thus responding to their actual needs as opposed to larger scale, speculative sport infrastructure. 
Consequently, one of the challenges of urban planning is to integrate these new activities within the existing structure (Andersen, 2011) and, of course, to reverse the trends leading to physical inactivity. The city should be as flexible and as accessible as possible in order to provide the opportunity of choosing from a variety of sport types, suitable for the entire population, and especially for susceptible groups, like children, elderly persons, disabled people or ethnic minorities.
5. How urban design can encourage people to move 
Traditionally, the relationship between public health and urban planning was maintained mostly by solving environmental issues. In the 21st century however, the risk of sedentary lifestyles requires planners and urban designers to look beyond this setting and to design neighbourhoods that encourage healthy, active lifestyles (Giles-Corti et al, 2015). This complex challenge requires a cross-sectorial approach and a closer cooperation between multiple sectors such as sports and public health professionals, urban planners, architects, politicians and city representatives (WHO 2015, Lee et. al., 2012). 
This idea reverberates in the policy documents advocating for active living. One of the missions of the WHO, expressed in its recent Physical Activity Strategy for the European Region, is to ensure an “enabling environment that supports physical activity through engaging and safe built environments, accessible public spaces and infrastructure” (WHO, 2015a). 
All the strategies, policy papers and guidelines reviewed for this paper stress the importance of a life-course approach in relation to enhancing the physical activity levels of the population. It is one of the priority areas of the WHO, in addition to being established as one of the strategic targets in Nike’s Designed to Move initiative mentioned earlier. 
It is therefore especially important to improve the quality of the built environment as it is our everyday environment where we spend most of our time with activities related to work, leisure and transportation. This is one of the key challenges for the VITAL CITIES project. 
5.1. WHO Healthy City Framework. 
In order to achieve the aim above, the WHO has developed a useful framework which will be considered as the backbone for the VITAL CITIES project. The organisation’s initiative called Healthy Cities defines such a city as “one that is continually creating and improving opportunities in the built and social environments and expanding community resources to enable all its citizens to be physically active in day-to-day life” (WHO, 2008, p3.). 
In this framework the built environment is one of the focus areas, and is strongly related to the social environment. The two domains reinforce and depend on each other. A comprehensive active living strategy would concentrate on all population groups and pay special attention to neighbourhoods with low socio/economic status.
5.2. The existing link. 
The past 15 years abound in research evidence that shows how and to which extent the physical environment can affect physical activity levels. The following overview lists the most important attributes of the built environment that can contribute to the increase of physical activity levels based on the literature review of Giles-Corti et. al. (2015) and other design guidelines and policy papers studied for this report: 
1. Transportation network. 
A well-connected public transportation network can enhance active living and be supportive for walking and cycling. This quality is affected by the factors below: 
Quality public transit system ; Street-connectivity. 

For example, numerous studies have found that a well-connected, safe street system encourages people to walk. Studies also found that in Germany, Denmark
2. Local access to shops, services. 
If services (schools, shops, sport facilities) are within easy reach people are more likely to choose walking instead of taking their car to arrive at these destinations. The following factors play a key role here: Proximity of services ; Mixed-use developments, neighbourhoods 

For example, the research suggests that neighbourhoods with mixed-use development correlate with lower level of obesity (NYC, 2012). 
People’s perceptions. 

People’s perceptions of public places based on qualities such as aesthetic appeal and perceived safety can affect physical activity in youth and adults (Nasar, 2005). 
3. Access to sport and recreational facilities. 
A number of studies have shown that proximity and access to parks and recreational spaces are crucial in enhancing physical activity levels both in the case of youth and adult population. 
4. Green infrastructure 
Quality and provision of green infrastructure contributes to active living. For example, a study referenced by Greenspace Scotland found that higher level of greenery can increase the activity levels of the population by almost three times. Proximity is also a key factor in this case, as the availability of green spaces also encourages people to move more (CABE, 2008; Arup, 2012). 
5. Network of public open space. 
The quality and provision of public open space is key in promoting physical activity. Public open space, as employed in this paper, refers to outdoor spaces (parks, playgrounds, sport fields, squares) that are publicly accessible. As the scale of urbanization is increasing globally, access to such spaces becomes increasingly important. Studies also found that people living in close proximity of such places leads to an increase in physical activity levels in all age groups. Research also demonstrates that if a place is well equipped with playgrounds and sport infrastructure, after school activities are more likely to occur there. 
A comprehensive active living strategy applies a cross-sectorial approach to develop design and policy measures to influence all the above factors. The mix of measures depends on the individual context that should be researched for each case. Acknowledging the importance of all the built environment attributes explained above, the VITAL CITIES framework aims to specifically concentrate on public open space development and to apply innovative tools to redesign such places that encourage active living.
5.3. Deprived areas. 
As seen above, the increased availability and improved quality of open public spaces and recreational areas can boost physical activity levels. This is especially important for deprived areas, in neighbourhoods with lower socio/economic status. These areas are the least likely to have access to quality sports and recreational facilities. 
Furthermore, people living in neighbourhoods with lower socio/economic status are the hardest groups to reach in terms of physical activity promotion measures (programmes, campaigns). 
Therefore, the VITAL CITIES concept concentrates on neighbourhood development in such areas, in line with the recommendations and policy principles of the WHO and EU aiming for universal access, tackling inequality and maximizing participation. In these areas, the concept will be most effective also because of its urgency. 
Development at neighbourhood scale can entail small-scale interventions to complete the redesign and rehabilitation of public spaces. 
Many examples already show that investment in deprived areas undertaken in order to encourage healthy lifestyles is worth the effort. The case of Merida Youth Factory is a great example to illustrate this potential. The colourful playground was built in the outskirts of a small town in Western Spain, a poor and isolated area. The building which has bright colours and light materials (designed by Selgas Cano Architects) created an open and welcoming space for various activities from skateboarding to basketball.
The municipality sought a cost-effective way to channel the energy of the district’s youth towards physical activity. It commissioned the sport ground that was built from cheap materials and structures. Since its opening in 2010 it is filled with local youths.13 
Another convincing example is the case of vertical gyms, an innovative project by the globally acclaimed studio of Urban Think Tank. The Vertical Gymnasium14 project turned a former soccer field into a vertical fitness complex in the middle of a slum area in Caracas, a very densely populated area. The 1,000-m2 complex includes basketball courts, a dance studio, weights, running tracks, as well as a rock-climbing wall spread on several storeys within the building. The complex receives an average of 15,000 visitors per month. Since its inauguration it has helped to lower the crime rate in the area by more than 30 percent. The success of the idea and the project inspired such vertical gyms all over the world.
5.4. What do cities already do? 
Many cities all over the world have recognised the urgency of action related to physical activity as well as the competitive advantage that stems from making it into a priority of action. Several cities, private companies and research institutions have adopted specific planning and design strategies in recent years in order to promote physical activity in urban settings. 
In the US, the global report coordinated by Nike Inc. entitled Designed to Move is a global initiative created with the aim to reverse the trends and re-engineer physical activity back into everyday life. The report has ringed the alarm bell and inspired many cities worldwide to take the first steps. 
For instance, soon after the release of the report in 2012, New York City followed suit by publishing its Active Design Guidelines for New York City coordinated by the Centre for Active Design, a not-for-profit organization committed to making health and physical activity a central priority in the design and development of buildings, streets and neighbourhoods. The guideline is a result of the partnership of various city departments working with leading experts and professionals in the field. It intends to give designers and professionals concrete tools to encourage healthy lifestyles. 
With a similar intention, Toronto, one of the most liveable cities in the world, released its guide Active City Designing for Health in 2014, in which it developed 10 key design principles to encourage active living. 
In the UK, inspired by the Design to Move initiative an All Party Commission on Physical Activity was created in 2014 that advocates for a new approach in tackling the inactivity problem on a national level. It emphasises a cross-sectional working method and managed to create a nationwide coalition with leading third sector organisations such as the British Heart Foundation or Young Foundation. For the same reasons, the Design Council launched its initiative Active by Design in 2014. It aims to help national and local governments, developers, designers and communities to encourage active living by providing leadership, training and project support for newly designed places and redesigning existing infrastructure. 
Besides these coalitions and initiatives, other city governments are also taking the first steps in the UK. For example, Liverpool has developed a cross-sectorial strategy to combat lower-than-average life expectancy and inactivity, Edinburgh is progressively investing in cycling schemes year by year, while London Boroughs are advocating for the default 20mph limits to encourage active transportation. 
Copenhagen is a European benchmark city for championing active living strategies. It is characterised by experimental, out of the box thinking. The city is working close together with the academia, and the third sector like the Foundation Culture and Sport and the Centre of Sport and Architecture based at the Faculty of Architecture at the University of Copenhagen. The latter was among the first to develop guidelines for better integrating sport into the built environment. Their Activating Architecture report (2012) showcases several best practices along with useful measures and everyday ideas on improving the built environment. The results are already visible. For instance, the increased investment in public space since the 1970s has been linked directly to a 65% rise in the number of cyclists and a significant drop in both the quantity and speed of automotive traffic (Arup, 2012). Copenhagen has also pursued pioneering work on developing schemes to reach out to the most vulnerable groups including ethnic minorities. 
Besides these pioneering examples, the lack of funding for non-organised sport initiatives and measures is also a serious challenge for European municipalities. The literature review conducted for the report showed a common understanding of the arguments for the positive influence which sports can make to a range of social issues and health prevention. On the hand, there is also a lack of systematic monitoring and evaluation of the outcomes of sport or physical activity-based projects. This is partly due to the difficulty in defining measuring outcomes, the spontaneous nature, or short-term duration of such projects and limited funding. There is need for a better understanding of the relationship between participation in sport, the usage of existing sport infrastructure and the measurability of potential outcomes of new interventions. Also city municipalities should look for ways to better orchestrate the services and the budgets of various departments and allocate more funding for prevention and even sport-related infrastructure. 
In many cases sport infrastructures like parks and playgrounds have been destroyed or not well-maintained and are left in derelict, even dangerous state. In the case of socialist playgrounds for example that at the time of their conceptions were praised for their progressive design, have been left abandoned to give space to newly built infrastructure. Considering the realities of austerity urbanism however, revitalising existing infrastructures became a more convincing objective for cities. These spaces could be considered as the target areas for community-based actions to revitalise deprived areas and provide access to sports, for all segments of the population.
7. Themes of the VITAL CITIES Concept. 
Based on the above principles and guidelines, the VITAL CITIES Concept will concentrate on the following themes when designing for physical activity in deprived areas: 
Implementing community-based actions to redesign public space ;
Implementing IT-based actions to redesign public space; 
Better orchestrating the services coordinated by the city to promote healthy life style and contribute to social inclusion ;
Establishing innovative physical (not IT) equipment to promote sport in public spaces; 
Organisation of innovative events to promote healthy lifestyle.

The following chapter describes these themes by highlighting best practices examples from the field. 
7.1. Implementing community-based actions to redesign the public space. 
The Placemaking methodology and all the reviewed guidelines emphasise community participation as a key to success also when designing for physical activity (WHO 2015, Lee et. al., 2012). It is especially important to maximise the future use of the facilities and ensure the care for the space. Successful strategies within this category could entail for example: 
recycle playground for children and adults ; table tennis during the night in the local school/community house ; interactive city games created by residents ; organisation of sport events by local NGOs. 

7.2. IT-based actions to redesign public space. 
IT supported games and other digital technology applications can provide creative means to encourage people to move. Especially among children, it can prove to be a useful tool to make physical activity fun and playful. For example interactive city games supported by IT applications ; Interactive screens, motion sensitive billboards. 

Although its applications are largely untapped in the area of active urban designed, the section below provides a few pioneering examples.
7.3. Better orchestrating the services coordinated by the city to promote a healthy life style and social inclusion. 
When planning for intensive physical activity the guidelines emphasise the importance of a cross-sectorial approach that carefully coordinates the city’s facilities and provides incentives for residents to be active. This increases buy-in, support, resources and opportunities for any project. For example: 
City Sport Cards ; 
Playgrounds equipped with gyms for Mums: volunteers (organised by the municipality) take care of children, while a trainer provides specially adapted gym exercises for young mothers during specific days ;
increase hours of operation, maximising opening hours ; 

innovative safety measures ;
joint programmes with resources to keep facilities well maintained.
 
7.4. Establishing innovative physical (not IT) equipment to promote sport in public spaces. 
It is worth emphasising the idea that even small interventions can motivate people to be more active. The aesthetical appeal and the perception of a certain space are key factors in encouraging physical activities. Eye-catching and innovative equipment, such as the creation of walking routes, innovative wayfinding solutions48, creative staircase markings or innovative paving50 can be all seen as relevant interventions in encouraging people to move.
7.5. Organisation of innovative events to promote healthy lifestyle. 
Especially in the context of deprived urban areas, it is important to provide innovative programming and activities that reach out to the most vulnerable groups and empower and encourage the inhabitants to use the facilities and infrastructures in the neighbourhood. Special programming can also help to increase the image of a place.

"WEED.
Women Enterprise and Employment in local Development.

1. Introduction 
Women’s participation in the economy plays a vital role in the sustainable development of cities. The importance of such an approach is underscored by the Europe 2020 Strategy where great emphasis is put on economic growth and job creation at the same time as recognizing that inclusive growth. The emphasis is essential if small to medium sized cities are to benefit from the existing and potential contribution of all their residents. It is also significant when we recognize that gender equality has been and remains a fundamental value of the European Union. In November 2010 the Commission adopted the Strategy for Equality between Men and Women 2010-2015 (SEMW). The strategy aims in particular to make better use of women's potential, thereby contributing to the EU's overall economic and social goals and spells out a series of actions based around five priorities: the economy and labour market; equal pay; equality in senior positions; tackling gender violence; and promoting equality beyond the EU. When the Europe 2020 strategy is joined together with the SEMW whose stated aim is to ensure the use of “the potential and the talent pool of women more extensively and efficiently, so that economic and business benefits can be gained” the potential for change is significant in Europe. The WEED project contributes making such change possible. It has addressed themes that are of crucial importance in Europe: better engagement of women in entrepreneurship, employment and the knowledge economy. The project has focused on practical methods of mobilising women‟s potential as employees and entrepreneurs at a local level. The focus is particularly important at a time when there is evidence that despite the Strategy the political will to address gender equality in the economic field is weakening. EU funding for gender equality, for example, is decreasing and predictable and independent budgets for gender equality amount to only 0.37% of EU spending within the 2007-2013 multi-annual financial framework. In addition public sector cuts throughout Europe are growing and tend to have a disproportionate impact on women.

The basic assumption of the WEED project was that in a post crisis era, at a time when women across Europe are more directly exposed to the impact of economic change than ever before addressing gender inequalities in the labour market and entrepreneurship can provide an important key to social justice and economic growth. At the same time the project recognised it is not automatic that women‟s talents and skills are effectively used or that women automatically share in any benefits of growth: local level strategies to improve women‟s role and reduce gender segregation in employment, business creation and the knowledge economy are essential tools that need to be developed if current blockages are to be removed. Institutions and strategies to address gender equality issues at municipal level are key to effective local action and there is a will to increase them. The European Charter for Equality between women and men, for example, was drawn up by Council of European Municipalities and Regions in 2006 and had been signed by 1020 municipalities by 2011. However actions are often organized without reference to economic matters; they are often not well connected to local economic development policies and the challenge for cities involved in the WEED project was how to make better links between actions and organizations involved in equality and local economic development. By drawing on and developing concrete examples of successful gender strategies, the project has been able to identify best practices and explore real evidence-based choices for action. It has resulted in clearer proposals for local activities that can be taken forward by municipalities and their partners at local level. It thus supports future and ongoing efforts to promote gender equality in local economic development.

2. WEED, an URBACT project 
WEED was part of the URBACTII programme. URBACTII is jointly financed by the European Union (European Regional Development Fund) and the Member States in the framework of the Obj. Territorial Cooperation of the European Cohesion Policy 2007-2013. It is a European exchange and learning programme promoting sustainable urban development. It enables cities to work together to develop solutions to major urban challenges, reaffirming the key role they play in facing increasingly complex social and economic changes. A key focus in the programme is the help given to cities to develop concrete and pragmatic solutions that are new and sustainable and that integrate economic, social and environmental dimensions. It enables cities to share good practices and lessons learned with all professionals involved in urban policy throughout Europe. Under the programme WEED gathered eight cities from six countries that wanted to work both locally and with their European partners to identify more clearly the challenges they faced and the potential to improve performance in relation to gender inequality and economic development. The project comprised a two level approach: European and local. At the European level the project gathered, evaluated, compared and reviewed local policies and actions that have a proven positive impact on gender equality in enterprise and employment. The knowledge gained was made accessible to partners and a wider community of interest through workshops, sub theme reports and newsletters. At the local level the aim was for partners to benefit from the experience of all the involved cities in order to develop a Local Action Plan that provides an effective solution to real local issues. This plan was to be developed with the help of a Local Support Group that included key stakeholders on the ground. For the WEED project this meant the key issue was to develop both networks of key stakeholders and effective and sustainable responses (Local Action Plans) to the key challenges of: how to promote and support women in entrepreneurial activities, how to improve women‟s position in the labour market, how to promote and support women in science, research and the use of new technology. 

Policy lessons for cities 
The process of gathering and evaluating the information about good practice and about concrete actions has been an important part of the project. It has allowed their potential for use at local level to be explored and constitutes the basis of a range of policy lessons that partners felt were relevant for themselves and others trying to develop concrete actions to address gender inequality in employment, enterprise and innovation. The policy lessons are listed below but it should also be noted that the parallel process of developing increased commitment from local stakeholders was key to clarifying the areas where change was needed and could be achieved in the city partners of WEED. Without it innovative ways of thinking about how to increase local initiatives promoting women‟s involvement in enterprise creation and growth was difficult to consider and following the section on the key policy lessons gathered during the WEED project the lessons regarding how to improve the planning process at city level i.e. some lessons about how to achieve change are also presented. 
Policy lessons to increase women’s involvement in entrepreneurship at local level 
Whilst each partner city of the WEED project has developed specific and concrete actions for future action at local level it is worth remembering in this final report that in most ways local issues mirrored those found at European level, particularly those highlighted earlier in the report. All partner cities reported significant differences between male and female entrepreneurs, with women tending to own smaller businesses, operate with lower levels of capitalisation, manage firms in different sectors than men and have slower growth rates than firms owned by men. Gender specific barriers such as cultural norms and lack of access to finance were commonly reported but the gender gap was also explained by the sectors of business activity in the city where women currently worked and the age and size of female owned business. The following represent policy lessons the project felt could assist them in drawing up their local plans to address these gaps but can also be seen as useful points for others if the entrepreneurial potential of women is to be recognized and the Europe 2020 targets achieved. 
; Adopting policies to break ingrained attitudes towards boys’ and girls’, men and women’s entrepreneurial potential in school years and tertiary level education is a long term but necessary strategy 
; Providing easy, practical and flexible access to policy guidance and information services for both start up and growth phases of businesses increases women’s confidence in their entrepreneurial capacity 
; Promoting awareness amongst politicians and business leaders of the economic case for encouraging women into entrepreneurial activities is important for a sustainable gender equity strategy 
; Improving women’s access to finance, particularly micro finance is an important first step for business start up, especially when combined with innovative training and support 
; Introducing entrepreneurial training and support to unemployed women has a positive impact if realistic and sustained 
; A better balance of men and women in business networks and more female role models for female entrepreneurs increases women’s interest in starting and growing businesses 

Policy lessons to improve gender equality in employment at local level 
In all the WEED cities, as in the rest of Europe, the picture of women‟s potential to contribute to economic development is strong. Women have gained higher qualifications than in the past, they have entered the labour force in greater numbers, their place in the board room has begun to change. However overall, differences in labour market outcomes for men and women are wider than gender gaps in educational outcome, their labour market position is not equal to men‟s and although some see the economic crisis as one that affects men more than women austerity measures and public sector cuts mean that women are now more vulnerable. There is a risk that measures to address the still lower participation rates of women, the higher unemployment rate for women and their weaker position in the labour market are not sustained or extended. The policy lessons offered by WEED are, therefore, still highly significant and include :

Covering the additional costs that families incur when starting training or starting work is an effective way to reduce the marginal costs of working for mothers 
; City wide media campaigns generated by a municipality but involving employers increases awareness of gender segregation and inequality 
; Integration of labour insertion and training strategies with support for employers (demand side enhancement) can improve employment opportunities for women as well as men if it is gender sensitive 
; Municipal led active gender equality initiatives can improve employment conditions for men and women and increase the earnings of women 
; A continuum of childcare is essential for sustaining women’s employment and progress to better quality employment 
; The availability of reliable gender disaggregated statistics is key to enhancing evidence-based decision-making and policy development 

Policy lessons to improve women’s involvement in science and innovation at local level 
The European Commission‟s Europe 2020 Strategy identifies a need to develop an economy based on knowledge and innovation at the same time as prioritizing inclusive growth. Crucial to getting the knowledge and innovation of this equation up and running are three things:- 
; Providing the right environment for generating new ideas, whether in technology, ICT or less resource intensive innovation 
; Making sure that people have the right training and education to come up with new ideas and use the opportunities that innovation offers such as exploiting the potential of ICT 
; Securing broad based partnerships that break boundaries between industry, government and universities to ensure that commercial development of ideas/ innovation has both a positive social and economic impact 

The ways in which cities can contribute to such developments and how they can make sure such developments are inclusive when it comes to gender were the questions addressed by WEED partners. The following are some of the policy lessons they consider worth drawing on when developing local strategies:- 
; Creative changes in curricula and out of school activities that encourage girls and boys to engage in science, technology and ICT increases confidence amongst girls and boys to choose less gendered studies and careers. 
; Networks at local levels between public and private actors (chambers of commerce, universities, banks, municipalities) can help reduce the low involvement of women in the commercialisation of innovation if a gender perspective is added. 
; Local Accelerators that include mentoring can help women contribute to the diversification of a local economy and sensitise economic development agencies to women’s participation in existing programmes. 
; Municipal led active gender equality initiatives in science and technology can increase women’s interest and success in the ITC area. 


9. Planning lessons 
WEED is about promoting a more gender balanced economic environment in order to draw on the positive potential of women in local economies. The project has done this by developing new insights into women and men‟s routes into entrepreneurship and employment; developing and disseminating good practice in reducing gender specific segregation; and finally by developing Local Action Plans to sustain positive action for gender equality in local economies in the future. The evaluation of the Urbact I 2002-6 programme highlighted that, whilst the programme had been successful in mobilising participation in the programme, its outcomes had less impact at a local level than had been hoped. The URBACT guidelines state that local action plans should be developed by each URBACT partners in response to local issues. Their inclusion was aimed at increasing the impact of URBACT exchanges on local policies and practices. “Each plan should provide pragmatic, precise solutions based on the results of the transnational exchanges and should be jointly produced with the Local Support Group on the local level and with all the project partners on a transnational level, who examine the options, enrich the proposed plan”. Has this been achieved in WEED? The process of transnational exchange certainly focused on „pragmatic and precise solutions‟ so that whilst each partner city had their own priorities concerning the project themes from an early stage partners identified what lessons they could share with other cities and where they wanted to concentrate their efforts to achieve further progress. Involvement in joint planning of the transnational workshops and in planning and delivering on-line events driven by partner interests helped to create some highly effective synergies between local and transnational activities. For example a video that was created by the EntreprenörCentrum in Vasterbotten, a member of the Umea Local Support Group, for a WEED on-line session on inclusive enterprise creation is being used across Sweden to promote the type of actions they found work successfully.

The different experiences of LSG formation and working amongst WEED partners are reflected in the lessons that WEED offers for this way of working. The key lessons were: Partnership at local level brings focus and trust when it: - 

; develops a dialogue between stakeholders at local level, particularly as exploring possible solutions allows a stronger understanding of how agencies and organizations fit together. 
; reduces competition between agencies and opens up possibilities of engaging with new stakeholders and potential beneficiaries of policy change. 
; focuses on the development of a local action plan: it encourages a joint strategic agenda.

The conclusions from transnational work were that it can play an important role in giving a chance to exchange ideas and learn from each other when it involves: - 
; study visits, online presentations, newsletters with information about partner activities and funding opportunities; they all help to inspire partners to see their own work from another perspective. 
; exploring other experiences: it reduces the fear of new and innovative ways of doing things. 

The impact at local level was viewed positively by all partner cities. All partners felt significant changes had been achieved –the process of local planning and its capacity were seen to have improved, and in ways that suited the different environments of different cities. Led by municipalities but charged with developing partnerships at local level meant the LSGs and their outputs – integrated plans – are positively connected to real successes in terms of additional funding and, important at a time of public sector cuts, new approaches to doing more with less. The real added value though is the apparent commitment to sustain the long lasting working group that was created and showed itself capable of carrying on the action plans, of identifying opportunities offered by a Managing Authority through their calls, and of maintaining the creative synergy established between the stakeholders. 
10. The Local Action Plans 
The content of the final Local Action Plans shows the varied context and issues faced in different cities. Some are prioritizing actions to help women start up and develop enterprises, others to reduce gender segregation across the world of work and business. None are the same, each responds to local needs and local possibilities. Some are outlined below. The Umea LAP, for example, is interesting because it shows how a multi year, multi action strategy can be developed when local partners get together. The Celje LAP is another interesting example as it shows how closer connection with the Managing Authority and its calls plus the identification of service gaps alongside a focus on women, employment and enterprise can produce effective plans that attract significant funds. 
The Local Support Group in Umea produced a joint action plan for the Vasterbotten region. It focuses on equal opportunity in the workplace and the labour market. The main focus of the action plan is gender-specific segregation. It identifies the importance of reducing gender segregation for the region, for employers, for employees, for entrepreneurs and for a fair division of resources, power and influence. The action plan is signed by the Mayor of Umea, the County Governor of Vasterbotten, the Director of Swedish Public Employment Services, the Director of Leia Accelerator and the Director of ALMI (the lead partner and initiator of several programmes which assist in the starting up and development of new businesses). This commits all signatories to work together to implement the activities drawn up in the plan based on our specific and shared experiences and perspectives. The action plan is a multi-year strategy for the region‟s continued work toward reducing gender segregation of the labour market in Västerbotten. It includes ten areas of action including measures to increase mobility between female and male dominated sectors in the labour market (which has attracted funding from the Agency for Economic and Regional Growth) and also incorporates actions to draw attention to women‟s entrepreneurship and the male norm in the business world. Developing an integrated gender equalities plan also featured in three other cities: Celje, Santiago de Compostela and Amiens. In all three cities the adoption of gender equality policy at national and regional level represented the background to the local action. In Amiens the appointment of a Vice-Présidente responsible for developing actions against discrimination and for equality co-incided with the beginning of the WEED project and ensured a strong driver for assessing the needs of women in relation to employment and enterprise within the equalities strategy of the city. In Santiago de Compostela the existence and demands of national and regional equality action plans meant a strong commitment on the part of all the stakeholders involved in the Local Support group to the development of an integrated time specific equalities plan. In Celje a female coordinator for equal opportunities who provides advice and momentum on actions to achieve gender equality works in line with national gender equality priorities. In all three cities the WEED project contributed to action plans for achieving equalities in the economic sphere and helped to clarify the realities of what could be achieved and when. 
The main focus of the Local Support Group in Celje, which comprises members from the local Social Services, Employment Department, Chamber of Commerce and NGOs, was, however, the development of an integrated plan to produce greater gender equality in employment and entrepreneurship as well as the improvement of the quality of life of families living at a time of demographic and economic change. The Local Action Plan aims to meet a gap between the needs of families and public sector capacity to meet their needs: a gap that has been growing with the economic crisis and with wide ranging changes in traditional family structures. Based on an initial analysis of families, unemployed women in the city and local social service, training and employability resources the LSG worked on a project proposal for a Centre for Information, Consultancy and Education. The plan comprises an analysis of the quality and quantity of existing services, a clear outline for the establishment of a new educational programme for workers to support the elderly and families in crisis. The programme was to recruit and train unemployed women alongside the establishment of a register of available workers who had completed the training but also includes a programme of training for those who wish to be self employed in the sector. By the time the WEED project was finishing funding of 300.000EURo had been attracted from European Social Fund. Other action plans developed during the WEED project included proposed actions on three objectives: reducing barriers to female entrepreneurship, reducing inequalities at work and increasing women‟s involvement in innovation and new technology. Objective 1: To reduce barriers to women‟s entrepreneurship (Alzira, Enna, Crotone, Santiago de Compostela). Local action plans included:- 
; Extending mentor support for women entrepreneurs 
; Programmes to increase interest in entrepreneurship from school age to older age 
; Micro finance initiatives to encourage social enterprise in the knowledge economy 

Objective 2: To address the inequalities in the nature and quality of work available for men and women (Umea, Karvina, Amiens, Celje). Local action plans included:- 
; Developing training initiatives to open up new less gendered pathways 
; Measures to increase women‟s take up of employment training 
; Projects to change attitudes amongst employers towards more family friendly employment practices 

Objective 3: To reduce the underutilization of women‟s knowledge and skills in innovation and the knowledge economy (Santiago de Compostela, Enna). Local action plans included:- 
; Projects to change attitudes to science and IT amongst the young 

  A joint university/ municipality initiative to increase uptake of the enterprise route by female undergraduates, postgraduates and faculty members in knowledge economy 
; New training opportunities in new employment sectors (care) 
11. Challenges that remain 
This final report highlights the diverse and innovative way that WEED partners are responding to the challenges of reducing gender segregation and inequalities in employment and enterprise and ensuring the skills and talents of women are fully used for an inclusive, strong, sustainable growth in European cities. It is clear that no „one size fits all‟ approach is being adopted but it is also clear that, with commitment to gender equality, smaller city-based approaches can establish strategies and tools to address what are local as well as national challenges. Nevertheless a number of real challenges exist if those strategies are to be effective. These include making sure that new ways of working involving social and public economy are fully exploited and that promoting gender equality is seen as a positive way forward for local economies. It is clear from reviewing the work of the WEED partners and others that the commitment to equal opportunities and protection of the economically weakest can be achieved and indeed has been relatively advanced in the public sector but unless this is protected at a time of public sector cuts and transferred to the private sector progress will be limited. Women are increasingly likely to be the ones working in an economy fast changing to one where services are expanding rapidly, and where the need to counterbalance the loss of male employment has increased women‟s entry to the labour market or to enterprise. Ignoring women‟s economic potential is short sighted and cities have a role to play in ensuring this happens. 
In all the cities involved in WEED there is a recognition that gender equality strategies and actions are still necessary and that there is a need to make sure that the gender impact of local economic development policies and actions is considered and addressed. It is essential if women, families and cities are not to lose out. The partner cities of WEED enabled the cities to achieve a level of planning and commitment from key stakeholders that would not have been possible without the project. It highlights that even with limited resources new solutions can be explored, and they can be ones that do not involve additional resources but rather new approaches to old problems.

"WOODFOOTPRINT.
The urban footprint of wood industry.
1. The Project. 
The “Wood FootPrint” network is one of the 19 projects funded in the third call of the URBACT II programme for Urban Development, on the topic challenge: Promoting innovation and the knowledge economy. The project will try in particular to answer the question of how to conciliate the manufacturing sectors need for, and eventual abandon of, massive suburban space, with the notions of quality urban development, sustainability and economic competitiveness. The main added-value of the “Wood FootPrint” project will be that of developing urban policies that can both address the manufacturing sectors and the citizens’ priorities in terms of sustainable development. The goal will be to develop and share methods and practices for assessing the industrial ecological footprints of European cities, starting with the wood furniture sector and in particular with its heavy urban inheritance of abandoned showrooms, and sequentially extending to other ecological and sustainability aspects of the footprint and also to other manufacturing sectors. The exchange of visions and experiences should lead to new and innovative ideas for recycling, minimizing or completely erasing the industrial footprints, while continuing to promote, or fostering, both the economic development and the well-being and quality of life of the citizens. The manufacturing heritage in Europe is a strong one that can be felt in many European cities. Many European cities have followed a specialisation path along one particular industry – there are the “textile cities”, the “automotive cities”, the “ceramic cities”, the “wood furniture cities”. In these cases, the ties between the sector and the city are intense and can be felt in many ways – not only in terms of economic indicators and employment patterns, but also in aspects of urban development, including construction patterns. This is particularly visible for sectors that require large portions of land, either in order to manufacture their goods or to sell them, or both. The wood furniture sector is one of these cases. While manufacturing often takes places in small or medium sized factories, the size of the goods produced calls for the need of large warehouses to store them and massive showrooms in order to display them and sell them. Such showrooms in particular have strongly affected the urban development pattern of the cities characterized by this sector. They are large buildings, often multi story, more often of doubtful architectural taste, with large windows to display the merchandise inside and as such normally inefficient in terms of energy consumption, with ample car parking zones and placed along the main roads for easy access by car. As people who wish to buy furniture normally go by car – as they need to carry with them what they will buy – access by public transport to those areas has normally been neglected. Such showrooms are by no means exclusive of the furniture sector. They are common in several other sectors, such as ceramics and kitchen and sanitary equipment, construction material, machinery and also textile and fashion. Such buildings have popped-up in many European cities, deeply transforming the urban landscape, between the 70s and the late 90s, when purchase power was growing and production and sales were rising. But most of the traditional manufacturing sectors have been hit hard by the crisis and globalization since then, with most of the companies either displacing their production (and consequently their sales) or changing their business model, dropping direct sales to final clients and becoming suppliers to larger companies. In the particular case of furniture, the IKEA phenomenon has of course played a key role in this transformation. As a consequence of this, many factories and especially showrooms have been closed down, leaving a giant industrial footprint of “ghost buildings” in many cities. Other factors have added to this footprint: pollution, disforestation of surrounding areas, and unemployment and lack of qualifications of a large blue collar labor force. During the kick-off-meeting held in Paços de Ferreira on the 14th and 15th of June, the partners made a detailed analysis to the project focus and in order to make the project feasible within the limited resources (in time and in budget), it has been decided to maintain the original strategy of involving cities with links to wood industry supply chain but focus the project on what is the main innovative and challenging characteristic “Find solutions for empty urban buildings (industry and showrooms) and avoid others to become vacant”. 
However, other sub-topics, which are directed linked to the main topic, will be addressed, such as: Job creation: Job training and career advice, which facilitates the rapid vocational rehabilitation of unemployed people from wood sector (and others); Public Funding Management: Find public funding to move urban industry to industrial parks and identify tools to increase attractiveness of Business Parks and promote business parks to encourage inward investment and new business growth; Public/Private actions: Produce a strategy or methodology/consultancy involving the owners of the industrial buildings to make them interested in using their industrial buildings and sites as investment objects now and in the future. The reasons for choosing the Case Studies presented in this document were that they were being carried out in cities across the world that are facing the urban changes that are not too dissimilar to the Wood FootPrint partnership cities. Furthermore, they have all been under way for many years and are widely seen as being successful or being a lesson to learn. The case studies show in some cases potential directions and in others paths that should be avoided. The Wood FootPrint focus covers the three cross-cutting issues to be addressed by all the project proposals defined by the URBACT II Monitoring Committee: In terms of “Urban development management in the context of the economic and financial crisis” – since its focus stems directly from the economic and financial crisis and its impacts in cities (with declining manufacturing industries) and searches for alternative innovative ways to minimize its effects and reposition European cities in a path of sustainable growth with a social dimension; In terms of “Fostering of integrated and sustainable approaches to urban development” – since the core of the project is at finding new innovative solutions for empty urban buildings (industry and showrooms) and avoid others to become vacant promoting a sustainable urban development between the public and the private owners; In terms of “Effective partnership and multi-level governance processes” – the problems created by abandoned industrial buildings or vacant showrooms cannot be contained within property boundaries or city limits; they spillover to affect surrounding communities. As abandonment increases in a neighbourhood, property values decline and owners become less willing, and perhaps less able, to maintain their real estate. In turn, more and more properties fall into disrepair and eventual abandonment. It is this selfperpetuating dynamic that makes the word “blight,” with its association of disease and contagion, an apt metaphor for neighbourhood distress. Only effective partnerships (public and privates) and multi-level governance processes can solve such a complex problem for the European cities. 
2.2 The scope.
 Under the umbrella of “Wood FootPrint” topics and subtopics 5 transnational Working Group will be created: 
Thematic Group 1: Abandoned Buildings: the definition that will be used is “any commercial or industrial buildings that post a threat to public safety or that exhibit traits of neglect on the behalf of the property owner”. The land use of such properties can range from under-performing commercial properties known as greyfields (such as underleased shopping malls and strip commercial properties) to contaminated industrial properties commonly referred to as brownfields. Vacant properties are detrimental to cities and burden communities in a myriad of ways. Fundamentally, they are costly and wasteful. The resources that compose the properties themselves, including the infrastructure, and in many cases, the abandoned buildings that occupy the lots, put a strain on both the systems and the community that surrounds them. Leader: City of Viborg. Other cities involved: All the other cities. 
Thematic Group 2: Skills and Employment: addressing the topic of promoting requalification and re-integration of lay-off workers from declining sectors into the new sectors with growing potential, through training, advice, incentive measures and pushing the private sector to adopt measures to facilitate the requalification and new employment opportunities. The involvement of the local education system in this Thematic Group is vital to achieve positive outcomes. Leader: Municipality of Yecla. Other cities involved: All the other cities. 
Thematic Group 3: Industrial Parks for entrepreneurs and growth: addressing the topic of promoting industrial parks at international level to support the creation and growth of new companies and new jobs, which may enhance the competitiveness of the cities while contributing to improve the quality of life of its citizens. A further challenge in transforming people and places together is how to raise skills and aspirations in neighbourhoods that have lost large amounts of industrial employment. For many decades, postindustrial towns have also had to cope with population loss as well as economic decline, which has increased polarisation. This has left behind not just brownfield land but also people who lack the skills or opportunities to benefit from the new jobs without considerable support. The continuing decline in manufacturing has only partly been compensated for by the growth of financial and business services in the larger centres. Leader: Municipality of Wycombe. Other cities involved: All the other cities. 
Thematic Group 4: Diversification: The image of Europe as a manufacturing centre for traditional industries has been decaying over the last 20 years, but Europe and European cities are still home to many of such industries, such as furniture, textile, ceramics, machinery, and others. The reuse of abandoned structures can represent an opportunity for the economic growth and recovery of a diverse range of urban areas. For a city rapidly growing in population with the ability to expand political borders, or for a city with fixed boundaries that is losing population, vacant buildings remains a key competitive asset for implementing a number of economic development strategies: diversification of economic tissue (Tourism, Renewable energy, etc) creating jobs, increasing tax revenue, improving transportation infrastructure, and attracting residents. For those working on smart growth issues, the strategic reuse of urban vacant structures can represent a key opportunity for encouraging greater density and reducing the push to develop suburban greenfields. Leader: Border Region Authority (Monaghan). Other cities involved: All the other cities. 

Thematic Group 5: Public Private Partnerships (PPPs): this Thematic Group is considering 2 sub-themes: Legal Framework and Funding Management. The challenge is not just the collapse of traditional industries like furniture, textiles, construction, ceramics, shipbuilding, and other, but also that these places often lack other employers and investors to fill the gaps. Spreading the benefits depends on influencing the private sector and creating a new mood of confidence that will encourage new private investment and break the vicious circle of urban decline. Industrial investors want to invest in the prime locations, where demand is thought to be strongest. Funding Management focus on aspects of company incentives and support programmes across the whole value chain (from producers to final consumers), awareness and promotion campaigns, and linking Horizon 2020 pillars. Leader: City of Paços de Ferreira. Other cities involved: All the other cities. The objective of the working groups will be that of analysing good practices in the respective topic and produce suggestions for concrete actions, that once validated within the network and discussed within each city at ULSG level, can make its way into the Local Action Plan that each city will develop within the project. 
2. State of the Art at International level The Focus. 
The purpose of the state of the art report is to gather information and evidence that can support the Wood FootPrint baseline study. The report will highlight any gaps in knowledge, and identify significant opportunities and also barriers to carry out project options. An analysis of the State of Art Report will inform an evidence-driven vision and will be used to produce the final baseline study. The project focus is the wood industry supply chain and the main addressed topic is to “Find solutions for empty urban buildings (industry and showrooms) and avoid others to become vacant”, taking in consideration other sub-topics, such as:,Job creation: Job training and career advice, which facilitates the rapid vocational rehabilitation of unemployed people from wood sector (and others); Incentives management: Find incentives to move urban industry to industrial parks and identify tools to increase attractiveness of Business Parks and promote business parks to encourage inward investment and new business growth; Public/Private actions: Produce a strategy or methodology/consultancy involving the owners of the industrial buildings to make them interested in using their industrial buildings and sites as investment objects now and in the future. 
The Definition.
 There is no standardized definition of abandoned structures and the definitions imposed by municipalities vary greatly. For example, some cities contend that a structure is abandoned (and therefore presents an “imminent danger” to the community or threatens the city’s “health and safety”) if it has been unoccupied for 60 days; others use 120 days or longer as the threshold. In addition, much of the difficulty in obtaining an accurate count of abandoned structures resides in the rapid turnover of properties and the city’s administrative capacity to count - and therefore to know about – abandoned structures. Finally, a lack of reliable, comprehensive local data often translates into inconsistent definitions with the same kinds of structures being considered abandoned in one city and not in another. For the purpose of Wood FootPrint, the definition that will be used is “any commercial, or industrial buildings that post a threat to public safety or that exhibit traits of neglect on the behalf of the property owner”. The land use of such properties can range from underperforming commercial properties known as greyfields (such as underleased shopping malls and strip commercial properties) to contaminated industrial properties commonly referred to as brownfields. Vacant properties are detrimental to cities and burden communities in a myriad of ways. Fundamentally, they are a costly and wasteful. The resources that compose the properties themselves, including the infrastructure, and in many cases, the abandoned buildings that occupy the lots, put a strain on both the systems and the community that surrounds them. Vacant properties—dilapidated showrooms, abandoned industrial buildings, and vacant industrial lots—present communities with a complex problem and a compelling opportunity for neighbourhood revitalization. In some cities, the problem may be an isolated showroom or industrial building that deteriorates to the point where the property owner decides to evict the tenants yet fails to board up the windows. Derelict dilapidated showrooms, abandoned industrial buildings, and vacant industrial lots, however, can quickly become havens for crime and squalor. According to the brokenwindow theory, a few abandoned buildings can trigger a spiral of decline and disinvestment that strains local budgets and encourages businesses and residents to flee inner-city neighbourhoods and declining suburbs. A growing number of cities are pioneering holistic and policy strategies to abate and rehabilitate their vacant or underutilized industrial buildings. Most conversions are taking place in industrial buildings located in industrial cities1, as “furniture cities”. A few cities have gone even further by making the adaptive reuse of vacant industrial buildings an integral part of their infill development. The opportunity to reuse obsolete facilities in the urban core supports sustainability and smart growth initiatives designed to focus redevelopment in cities in an effort to decrease urban sprawl. Adaptive reuse offers a sustainable building site with existing infrastructure and materials. Adaptive reuse is the act of finding a new use for a building. It is often described as a “process by which structurally sound older buildings are developed for economically viable new uses”2. Industrial buildings and big showrooms are especially well suited to adaptive reuse due to their large, open spaces. Many of those buildings are significant primarily for their architecture, as vernacular relics from the industrial age, and may be less so for their association with prominent people and events. Adaptive reuse should be the preferred strategy for an industrial when no other industrial option is available, and should always be favored over demolition and redevelopment. There are countless reuse options available for industrial buildings. Some of the more popular conversions of industrial building and showrooms are to museums, art studios, live-work units, offices, residential units, schools, retail, and increasingly more are combining several uses together. 
The Context.
 Since the early 1960s European cities have experienced shrinkage in population and a rapid increase in wasteland and contaminated land. As human activities have spread over territories of unusual dimension, huge industrial zones, former military installations, and outdated infrastructure—the sites of nineteenth- and twentieth-century modernity— are suddenly empty. The change has been particularly acute with regard to sites of industry. Many small factories within old areas of dense urban fabric have been abandoned, their activities spread to more peripheral areas or relocated outside Europe. Today many quarries, harbors, railways and canals—much of the infrastructural network accumulated over more than two centuries—have fallen into disuse. Such abandonment has had important impacts on employment, demographic growth, and the social, functional and symbolic geography of cities. This story is not new. Again and again through history, European cities have been partially abandoned by their inhabitants and their activities. But each time a rebuilding has taken place that has made selective use of the old. Indeed, the Wooden European city and its countryside is a good example of the changes that European cities are facing. Wooden businesses could cut costs by moving to less expensive labor markets. At the same time, the technology base and the geopolitical framework of the European metropolis were changing. The world economy was restructuring, and the rise of new countries was creating a global market, creating ruptures with Europe’s urban and social past. During the 1980s many European cities started to react to their decline and look for answers to the social and economic problems caused by the growing wastelands they contained. In particular, they began to compete against each other to employ newly vacant land to attract substitutes for lost functions. Museums, theatres and exhibition halls; office buildings and sports facilities; congress halls, airports and shopping malls were proposed as ways to fill these urban voids. But their construction has frequently led only to further fragmentation of urban territories. Such urban restructuring has also given rise to a redistribution of monetary and symbolic value. The world of global consumption is built on the skeletons of former global production sites. As manufacturing has left Europe, the deindustrialized sites have become points of specialised and spatialized consumption in order to survive. In many cities, this may result in little more than a museum for the former product in the location of the former factory. As a result of this transformation process, many European cities tied to a specific sector now face a dilemma: on one side they must enhance economic development and create employment, either by reinforcing the main sector of activity or by diversifying into other sectors; and on the other side they must address the industrial footprint that has remained from the huge investments made until the 90s, and that is seriously jeopardizing their image as well as the general well-being and quality of life of its citizens, creating an atmosphere of decay and decrepitude that is not tolerable with the image of growth, dynamism, innovation and competitiveness that cities must project in order to compete in the modern, global economy and be able to attract investors and qualified people. The image of Europe as a manufacturing centre for traditional industries has been decaying over the last 20 years, but Europe and European cities are still home to many of such industries, such as furniture, textile, ceramics, machinery, and others. Furniture, in particular, and more specifically wood furniture, is still a big business in Europe, where the most renowned brand names are located and have their production. All over the world, thinking of wood furniture is thinking first of a particular European brand, and of Europe in general, and this is one of the sectors where Europe keeps a clear “image and recognition” lead above all competitors. The European furniture sector comprises around 150,000 companies, generates a turnover of almost €126 billion and an added value of €38 billion and employs around 1.4 million people (EU27, 2006), with the wood furniture sector being particularly important in countries such as Portugal, Italy, Spain, United Kingdom, Greece and Sweden. Manufacturing and selling big items requires big spaces such as factories and large showrooms. During the prosperity years of manufacturing sector in Europe, industry dependent cities have witnessed a pop-up of such buildings along the main road axis and suburbs, strongly marking urban development. Nowadays the rapid transformation of these sectors led to the abandon of most of these, leaving a giant urban footprint that is a serious challenge to cities that have inherited it and a warning to others. 
The Public role.
 The best way to solve a problem is asking the right questions. Asking the question ‘what has this building been?’ in addition to ‘what could this building become?’ will result in a conversion that does not hide the building’s past. A successful adaptive reuse project of industrial building or unused showrooms can bring redevelopment, tourism, and new life into a community. The problems created by abandoned industrial building or vacant showrooms cannot be contained within property boundaries or city limits; they spill over to affect surrounding communities. As abandonment increases in a neighbourhood, property values decline and owners become less willing, and perhaps less able, to maintain their real estate. In turn, more and more properties fall into disrepair and eventual abandonment. It is this selfperpetuating dynamic that makes the word “blight,” with its association of disease and contagion, an apt metaphor for neighbourhood distress. In the worst cases, the downward spiral of deterioration and abandonment continues until entire blocks and neighbourhoods are rendered virtually uninhabited. Vacant and abandoned commercial buildings (greyfields), unlike brownfields, these sites generally do not have any or only insignificant amounts of environmental contamination. Yet they can still create a blighting influence on an entire neighbourhood. Unfortunately, local governments do not always have the same legal tools to abate commercial structures, and different standards and procedures often apply. Moreover, the economics of the regional market place comes into play more with commercial buildings, thus, local governments have to modify their negotiations and other compliance strategies. Few local governments have actively engaged in acquiring these sites and doing the redevelopment on their own. The stabilization of vacant properties is an important part of the revitalization cycle and infill development process. The cleaning up of debris and graffiti can have a positive effect on the blight caused by vacant properties. In addition, it is important to prepare these sites for rehabilitation or redevelopment. It is especially critical to stabilize buildings which might be rehabilitated, so that all deterioration is halted. It is apparent that local governments must have the ability to take a variety of actions in order to tailor the remedy to the facts of a particular property. More importantly, local governments need to build consensus with the community about their vacant property programs and the specific applications of these legal remedies. Certain properties demand more aggressive actions, while other properties may only need a simple notice to the owner or some financial assistance. The challenge is not just that the collapse of traditional industries like furniture, textiles, construction, ceramics, shipbuilding, and other, but also that these places often lack other employers and investors to fill the gaps. Spreading the benefits depends on influencing the private sector and creating a new mood of confidence that will encourage new private investment and break the vicious circle of urban decline. Industrial investors want to invest in the prime locations, where demand is thought to be strongest. Hence secondary locations, such as industrial areas, often lose out in attracting new offices or residential development, and there is no way that current levels of public funding can close more than a few of the gaps. A further challenge in transforming people and places together is how to raise skills and aspirations in neighbourhoods that have lost large amounts of industrial employment. For many decades post-industrial towns have also had to cope with population loss as well as economic decline, which has increased polarisation. This has left behind not just brownfield land but also people who lack the skills or opportunities to benefit from the new jobs without considerable support. The continuing decline in manufacturing has only partly been compensated by the growth of financial and business services in the larger centres. With certain problem properties and complex cases, a city may pursue demolition or force the transfer of the vacant property to industrial parks. Cities generally view demolition as last resorts and property transfer to industrial parks as a suitable solution, however, would prefer to work with the existing owner to perform the necessary repairs and rehabilitation. Beyond the abatement and rehabilitation of individual vacant properties, cities should integrate vacant properties initiatives with relevant community-wide revitalization efforts. Instead of working one vacant property at a time, cities could achieve greater neighbourhood stability through these traditional planning strategies. Vacant property prevention programs present the best hope of permanently addressing the problem of vacant properties. Cities are facing this challenge and a few have even made vacant properties an integral part of their smart growth approaches to infill development. Even successful communities, however, continue to battle against vacant properties in relative isolation. Vacant Properties Revitalization Cycle is a strategic framework for revitalization3. The cycle can serve as a self-assessment tool for local vacant property programs as a gauge of how to best allocate resources. Involves the following actions:IPrevention: Work with property owners, buildings inspection, pro-active code enforcement, etc.; PAssessment: Know the territory and understand particular local conditions affecting abandonment; Stabilization: For most cities, the immediate goal is to stabilize the site or neighbourhood. Cities generally use a wide array of abatement powers and code enforcement strategies to get the owners to clean up and secure these properties. A major objective is to attract private reinvestment back to these blighted neighbourhoods by using city resources to stabilize a few target sites; dAbatement: The first responsibility is to abate those unsafe and unhealthy conditions that create public nuisances on the property and for the surrounding neighbourhood. Investigation and owner’s profile: A critical step during the preliminary investigation is to find out why the property owner let the property deteriorate. Does he or she have the interest and the commitment to make the necessary repairs to bring the property back up to normal conditions of use; aNeighbourhood inventories: Vacant properties tend not to exist in isolation. Municipalities should routinely inventory vacant properties throughout the city to assess possible patterns within neighbourhoods and among property owners. Such inventories also can provide a list for possible investors. rRehabilitation resources: After stabilizing the site, cities often provide property owners with a wide variety of resources to encourage them to rehabilitate eligible vacant properties: Financial resources: CDBG funds, rehabilitation loans, tax credits, tax abatements, waiver of municipal liens; Technical assistance: permit streamlining, flexible rehabilitation codes, referrals to private sector consultants and contractors, coordination with nonprofits and other local agencies; tProperty transfer or demolition: With certain problem properties and complex cases, a city may pursue demolition or force the transfer of the vacant property to industrial parks; lLong-term revitalization policies and prevention programs: Beyond the abatement and rehabilitation of individual vacant properties, cities should integrate vacant properties initiatives with relevant community-wide revitalization efforts.  
The growth opportunity. 
Much of the story of globalization is a tale of winners and losers. Older manufacturing sites such as some western European cities deteriorate physically, socially, and economically and return to the prairie from which they developed. Those cities with old manufacturing and showrooms sites could have been abandoned in face of globalization or courted a new industry to occupy its downtown, but instead its leaders took a unique path: fully investing in the service sector of its former manufacturing industry, not analyzing what that choice looks like and the consequences it has on urban space. Globalization is happening, but local actors can shape the relationship. Local growth coalitions can sacrifice cultural and economic particularities to grab a piece of global capital. The reuse of abandoned structures can represent an opportunity for the economic growth and recovery of a diverse range of urban areas. For a city rapidly growing in population with the ability to expand political borders, or for a city with fixed boundaries that is losing population, vacant buildings remains a key competitive asset for implementing a number of economic development strategies: creating jobs, increasing tax revenue, improving transportation infrastructure, and attracting residents. For those working on smart growth issues, the strategic reuse of urban vacant structures can represent a key opportunity for encouraging greater density and reducing the push to develop suburban greenfields. It’s not that cities have failed to do anything to deal with vacant property. In fact, many cities, regardless of size and geographic location, expend tremendous resources trying to “abate” public nuisances associated with vacant and abandoned properties. However, this attention to regulating and managing vacant land has often resulted in short-term fixes rather than long-term solutions. No one really knows the depth of this resource. It still remains unclear how much urban vacant or abandoned industrial and showrooms buildings exist in European cities, as there have been no comprehensive, systematic studies assessing these conditions. Consequently, recent national data on the amount of vacant or abandoned industrial and showrooms buildings do not exist. The reuse of such structures is critical to the economic growth and recovery of older areas. For any city to take advantage of this resource, its public and private decision-makers must first know how much vacant property exist within its borders, where they exists, and the condition of their supply. 
6. Synthesis and Main Expected Outcomes for Implementation Stage.
 The analysis of the state of the art in clearly highlights the vertical approach of Wood FootPrint project. The feedback from the Evaluation Assessment Panel (EAP) highlights the coherence of the main objectives, while stressing the need to ensure that a focus is maintained on wood sector and that the outputs and results are concrete and relevant to the specific needs of the partners. The implementation phase of Wood FootPrint should be conductive to the developing of urban policy measures that may lead to economic developing and urban integration of abandoned buildings within the partner cities, resulting in the creation of jobs and the reduction of the social pressure over local administrations. The main added-value of the “Wood FootPrint” project, will be that of developing urban polices that can both address the manufacturing sectors and the citizen’s priorities in terms of sustainable development. The goal will be to develop and share methods and practices for assessing the industrial ecological footprints of European cities, starting with the wood furniture sector and in particular with is heavy urban inheritance of abandoned showrooms, and sequentially extending to other ecological and sustainability aspects of the footprint and also to other manufacturing sectors. The exchange of visions and experiences should lead to new and innovative ideas for recycling, minimizing or completely erasing the industrial footprints, while continuing to promote, or fostering, both the economic development and the well-being and quality of life of the citizens. The transnational exchange and learning activities should be coordinated, integrated and aligned with a clear and measurable end goal. That is not to be a set of disconnected activities, but a program of activities which follow a common line capable of encouraging the participation of cities and relevant stakeholders in presenting ideas and concepts from theory to practice, and that will be more easily assimilated. Each program shall be designed as an integrated program, with various steps to develop a common theme incrementally and appropriately to the age range of the public they are addressed to. The goal is the creation of integrated, development oriented partnerships (private or/and public), able to offer sustainable solutions for empty urban buildings (industry and showrooms) and at the same time avoiding others to become vacant”. However, other subtopics, which are directed linked to the main topic, will be addressed, such as: Jobs creation, Public Funding Management and Public/Private actions. Exchange of knowledge and mutual learning is mainly made by gathering people together under a common theme of interest and as such, the project will put a great focus on the organisation of thematic events at the different participant cities and also in the organisation of missions for making contact with relevant success factors and initiatives within the Wood FootPrint context. In addition to the continuously scrutiny of relevant initiatives and measures, which may or not be the subject or further studies, and may or not be retained for the final report which will suggest measures for adoption in the cities’ LAP, each working group should select and develop 1 particular measure for further development, under the shape of a case study. The measure to be retained should be considered by the WG as particular relevant for the objectives of Wood Footprint and very suitable for adoption under the LAP of a significant number of project partners.

"INTRODUCTION. 
The State of the Art is the first part of the Baseline Study on the CIA 7 network which also includes the Partner Profiles and a Synthesis. It reflects on the experiences and debates of integrated urban development which became the reference framework of the current European funding period 2014-2020. The focus is on Article 7 of the ERDF regulation which introduced innovative tools of implementation and funding of interlinked actions. Managing Authorities (MA) and cities in this context need to act as partners to fulfil the objectives developed in the Operational Programmes. Innovative approaches of multilevel governance and co-production have to be applied and shared. New roles have to be tested based on an analysis of interests of the involved stakeholders in the decision-making processes. The step from planning to implementation and funding with shared responsibilities is a joint policy challenge which all partners of the CIA 7 URBACT Implementation Network are exploring. The exchange and learning activities on the promotion of attractive and strong urban areas and social inclusion in a way that enhances the quality of the natural and physical environment and the quality of life of the inhabitants will develop around this common policy challenge. The urban dimension of cohesion policy in the programming period 2014-2020 has been strengthened by new instruments in the Operational Programmes for sustainable development in cities. An allocation of a minimum of 5% of the national ERDF envelope was foreseen for this purpose with Article 7 of the ERDF regulation N° 1301/2013 (European Commission 2013a). From a recent DG REGIO overview, the total allocation is about EUR 14.5 billion which is 7.8% of ERDF, exceeding the minimum clearly. Half of the Member States spend much more than 5% (Matkó 2016). Many expectations are being raised on these new instruments in terms of efficiency and improvement of the implementation of sustainable and integrated urban policies and practices, also in terms of governance empowering cities by delegating some MA functions – at least project selection. The ‘integrated approach’ has become a recurring topic in European cohesion policy developing over more than two decades. The Urban Acquis (2005) based on the experiences with the Community Initiative URBAN I (1994-99) and URBAN II (2000-06), the Leipzig Charter on Sustainable Cities (2007) and later the Toledo Declaration (2010) laid the ground with the definition of principles of integrated urban development. This philosophy fostered and structured a debate on a stronger role of cities and the needs of integrated urban regeneration in European mainstreaming. From a European overview five years after adopting the Leipzig Charter emerges a general shift towards integrated approaches, even though still with different speeds and activities. “This can be attributed to the fact that there is no single urban model in Europe – environments, problems and potentials differ not only from country to country, but also from city to city. On top of this, urban policy has a different relevance in the various EU member states, its candidate countries as well as in Norway and Switzerland, and is therefore not supported to the same extent at national level.” (BMVBS 2012, p. 21) In his 2009 report for the European Commission Fabrizio Barca argued that an integrated territorial (or placebased) approach should be used to revitalise cohesion policy, helping the EU reach its economic and social objectives. “A place-based policy is a long-term strategy aimed at tackling persistent underutilisation of potential and reducing persistent social exclusion in specific places through external interventions and multilevel governance. It promotes the supply of integrated goods and services tailored to contexts, and it triggers institutional changes.” (Barca 2009, p. VII) Facing the economic crisis, in June 2010 the European Council adopted the Europe 2020 Strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth which was also the economic policy background for the 2014-2020 EU budget (European Commission 2010). Cohesion policy under this influence has shifted to result orientation with more efficient and effective interventions and a cross-cutting dialogue between stakeholders, a necessity in front of the major challenges stressed also in the URBACT study on Cities facing the crisis, “the challenge of unemployment and the challenge of managing our cities in a period of major cuts in public expenditure” (URBACT 2010, p. 5). In the Cities of Tomorrow report from 2011 the multilevel governance challenges have been further developed: “New relations are being forged between different levels, e.g. between the European and the local levels. The range of actors involved in policy-making and policy shaping needs to be widened to include diverse stakeholders, including citizens. In essence, policies have to operate in a multiscalar governance framework.” (European Commission 2011, p. 93) A place-based approach is challenging because it demands cross-sector and cross-department thinking and acting, at all administrative levels, together with a mixed and integrated funding. The outcomes from the study on 50 good practices on urban development funded by ERDF in 2007-13 stress how „physical regeneration is still a major driver in creating multi-stakeholder cooperation in the integration of policies. However, in the best examples, both people and place-based approaches are combined at relevant administrative levels. This combination of place-based and people-based approaches is most visible in those cases where the national level is committed to developing the two approaches together.” (European Commission 2013b, p. 59) Area-based interventions within an integrated city-wide urban development strategy are most effective means, as the findings from URBACT II confirm: Cities need to act in a comprehensive way, coordinating policies (e.g. spatial intervention on housing, urban planning, mobility with cultural, social and economic interventions), and the work with the community, civil society organisations, with the private sector and other relevant stakeholders. But this is not yet mainstreaming: Integrated urban development needs a radical shift to demonstrate the effectiveness of area-based and cross-sector approaches. “The integrated approach demands a management innovation in local government – it demands a paradigm shift in the way local government manages policy fields, multi-level governance and functional areas” (European Commission 2013b, p. 31). This is in brief the context and the starting point for the “Cities in Article 7” (CIA 7) Implementation Network with the European Metropole of Lille, France as the Lead Partner. With a strong will of ‘learning by doing’ it goes to explore how cities benefiting from ERDF funding for the implementation of integrated urban strategies under Article 7 of the ERDF regulation are facing the mentioned challenges and making use of the potentials in terms of management innovation in local government. 
2. OVERVIEW OF KEY IMPLEMENTATION CHALLENGES AND HOW THEY LINK TO THE POLICY FIELD The main aim of the URBACT Implementation Networks is to improve the implementation and delivery of cities’ integrated strategies or action plans. Challenges related to implementation within Article 7 are in the focus of CIA 7 exchange and learning activities. The following 7 implementation-related challenges have been defined by the URBACT programme, out of which 3 mandatory challenges (to be explored by all Implementation Networks) and 4 optional challenges (every network to select the most relevant for their partners). Additionally, communication can be considered as a transversal tool in all challenges. In this overview these challenges are discussed with policy documents, research and practice examples. 
3.1 DELIVERY – Ensuring the integrated approach in the delivery of the strategy and their related actions/projects (mandatory challenge no. 1) 
The participatory approach shall improve the implementation process and the delivery of the urban strategy or local action plan (strengthening the evidence base, ensuring ownership of the problems identified and of the solutions/ policies developed, creating the conditions for a successful delivery, etc.). The integrated sustainable approach for urban development has already been practiced since the URBAN I and II programmes (1994-2006). URBACT drew on this experience when designing the URBACT Local Support Group approach to Local Action Plans. From the experiences of the URBACT network RegGov, local, horizontal and vertical cooperation are crucial elements of integrated delivery (RegGov 2011, p. 16): Local cooperation: Relationship between different actors within the neighbourhood and between neighbourhood and city. Horizontal cooperation: Relationship / networks between cities within a determined area. Vertical cooperation: Relationship between cities and Managing Authorities A lasting and efficient “horizontal cooperation” between all relevant actors on the local level and making sure that all relevant key players, associations and organisations contribute to the development and implementation of Integrated Local Action Plans can guarantee that all possible resources are activated and integrated and all possible synergies are realised. A mayor challenge using Article 7 tools is how to achieve improved and more reliable forms of “vertical cooperation” from the neighbourhood across the city level to the level of managing authorities. Vertical integration can provide political and strategic support and supply concrete advice on how to bundle different programmes and funding opportunities. The challenge when implementing the urban strategy or local action plan is to create an integrated operational framework. The whole strategy has been developed in an integrated way, but how to manage to get integrated projects/actions out of it is another challenge. Urban problems faced in the strategies are complex and can only be solved with a tight project pipeline for the catalogue of actions and measures from social,

Vertical integration can provide political and strategic support and supply concrete advice on how to bundle different programmes and funding opportunities. The challenge when implementing the urban strategy or local action plan is to create an integrated operational framework. The whole strategy has been developed in an integrated way, but how to manage to get integrated projects/actions out of it is another challenge. Urban problems faced in the strategies are complex and can only be solved with a tight project pipeline for the catalogue of actions and measures from social, arrangements); Social inclusion, participation, empowerment; Attractiveness & Competitiveness (including promotion / marketing). City regions and metropolitan areas, like the forced creation of metropolitan authorities (such as the first French Communautés urbaines), and the creation of a new legal framework for metropolitan cities (such as 14 Cittá metropolitane in Italy which in 2014 substituted the provinces), add another important governance level to the multi-level system. Within the CIA 7 network some partner cities with no tradition in inter-municipal coordination had to establish and delimitate agglomerations or functional urban areas for the ITIs under Article 7 (e.g. the Czech and Polish partners). The participatory approach with a broad engagement in policy-making and delivery gives more consensus on the strategy, and is needed not only for restricted resources but because of the convincement that no single organisation has the know-how and the capacity to do everything. Consultation and coordination of a variety of actors are a management activity which needs a structural framework. The participatory approach is crucial to be continued for implementation and delivery. Maintaining involvement of local stakeholders during the implementation process is a mayor challenge. There are various stakeholder groups, with more or less capacity to represent their interests who need different tables and formats of involvement. Stakeholders can be grouped as follows (URBACT Summer University Krakow, LAB 1 presentation, 2011): Territorial level: Neighbourhood, City, Region/Intermediate level, State, European level. Sectors and departments: Urban development, Economic affairs, Social affairs/Welfare, Employment and Professional Instruction, Education/Schools, Culture, Sports etc. Public sphere: Public administration, politicians, decision-makers, public companies. Semi-Public: Welfare organisations, (partially, especially public) housing companies. Private economic actors: Companies and entrepreneurs not locally based, Local business owners, (partially) housing companies, individual property owners. Civic actors: Civic organisations representing (parts of) the community: youth/children, families, migrants/ethnic groups, handicapped, elder people etc., Associations of inhabitants, Engaged individuals and inhabitants Engaging all stakeholders in coproduction and gathering them in the URBACT Local Group (ULG) can strengthen the active involvement in transnational exchange activities and in the development of concrete solutions to the implementation challenges identified by the city, in relation to maintaining the integrated and participatory approach during the implementation, funding, selection of projects, etc. Questions of interest for the CIA 7 network. Maintaining the involvement of local stakeholders and consultation and participative issues in the implementation process, what are the intentions and capacities of active involvement in decisionmaking? How to integrate the involvement in the decision-making? If you want to empower citizens and other stakeholders there is no “one size fits all” way, how do you develop tailor-made formats for different local stakeholder groups (citizens, businesses, third sector)? How to integrate these stakeholder groups in the URBACT local group (ULG)? When is the right moment, what are the right tables for involvement in the process? They are a critical success factor of implementation, but it is a long-term process, how to maintain interest and enthusiasm? How to coordinate conflicting interests? How to access NGOs? Organising decision-making within the public institutions involved, which resource management forms between city, city region, region, managing authority are needed? According to the different levels: national/regional (e.g. city networks), city (round tables, forum), neighbourhood (management)? How to achieve better cooperation with the managing authority for the action plan to be implemented?
 3.3 IMPACT – Setting up efficient indicators and monitoring systems to measure performance (mandatory challenge no. 3) 
Some cities are experienced in measuring and monitoring the effectiveness of activities and the achievement of objectives. Where city-wide monitoring systems have been developed, they fulfil an important role for the selection of priority areas for intervention and for assessing progress at project and programme level. They sometimes can be considered an “early warning system” of critical socio-economic situations at an early stage. The Dutch city of Nijmegen has established a municipal department of research and statistics which every two years undertakes a city-wide and neighbourhood monitoring report, together with an annual monitoring of the inner city because of the city centre’s economic importance. They also do a special form of qualitative research. In all parts of the city covered by the neighbourhood monitor, a list of professionals and representatives of the local population gets compiled. All persons listed receive a mail in order to inform the Department about the most important local changes. The Monitoring Report is communicated to all departments and to the representatives of the neighbourhoods (RegGov Seminar Report on monitoring progress and achievements in integrated neighbourhood). Programme and project-related monitoring systems are important, the methodology to measure impact under Article 7 needs yet to be discussed: In some cities there are broad OP specific indicators to be followed, in others ITI tailor-made indicators have been developed. A continuous and detailed feedback system and a clear organisation structure in the municipalities are an important challenge, even for the mid-term evaluation of the ITI strategy. Besides the output indicators, the definition of result indicators which are the variables to measure the intended change is crucial. The increased emphasis on results orientation in cohesion policy also means that cities will need to improve their capacity in measuring results. There are experiences with regional indicator-based monitoring systems in North Rhine-Westphalia combined with self-assessment of projects at city level within the Socially Integrative City Programme. The URBACT network TOGETHER used participative methods to build indicators of well-being with the citizens themselves. The goal is to enlarge the impact of public and private actions considering these criteria and to develop pilot actions of social inclusion around the idea of co-responsibility of the actors themselves (TOGETHER 2011). Qualitative results, like behaviour change, image change or awareness, are hard to measure, but this is more and more needed due to the complexity of implementation of integrated strategies. There are methods to create feasible indicators, e.g. building target trees, conducting monitoring visits and creating participative processes. The OECD Better Life Index has identified 11 topics of material living conditions and quality of life (http://www.oecdbetterlifeindex.org) giving valuable hints for a qualitative dimension of monitoring and assessment. Questions of interest for the CIA 7 network. How to frame output and result indicators of an urban strategy or action plan in a meaningful and relevant way? What about integration in monitoring and evaluation of actions to be implemented? Where does it take place? How to make monitoring the target a core work of the stakeholder group? If you need city-wide monitoring, on what base and at which frequency? Which data are available, from national statistical sources broken down to local level or data developed at local and neighbourhood level? There are only few ERDF/ESF result indicators at MA level. Reporting of output indicators and impact evaluation with qualitative territorially sensitive indicators, e.g. quality of life, are needed. How to measure change?
 3.4 QUALIFYING PROCESS – Moving from strategy to operational action-plan (optional challenge no. 4)
 In the UDN peer review on the city of Brno, one of the Czech ITI metropolitan areas, the organisation of the selection system of actions was an important challenge. Recommendations were made about creating transparency at and between all governance levels, early communication with all involved local authorities, early start of the negotiations with the national level, and exchange with other metropolitan cities using ITI (UDN Brno 2016). This exchange is needed also in other national contexts, in the Czech case meanwhile it is being organized by the national managing authority combined with city visits. What is important and becoming more and more state of the art in European cities is to use the integrated urban development strategy as an opportunity, not only in the function of a specific funding programme but providing a thematic and strategic framework for a cyclical implementation process of all potential projects and actions emerging in the area. This link from the local strategy to an overall integrated framework for a broader area can be an important aspect in order to develop the leverage effect of European funding. The strategy of the European Metropole of Lille and its Managing Authority to use the ITI within Article 7 as the European “branch” of implementation of the national programme “Politique de la ville” concentrating on the parts of the metropolitan area most in need is exercising this kind of integration. Article 7 requirements, especially concerning the capacity building during the Integrated Territorial Investment organisation in the cities, should be analysed in terms of efficiency of the process from strategy towards operational action plans. An integrated urban strategy that combines actions from different thematic axes and includes other beneficiaries requires more than the implementation of technical works or actions derived by the city alone. It is a challenge how to create processes of controlling, objectively evaluating and managing different types of projects, actions and works beyond the communal procedures.  The organisation of calls for projects in some cases according to Article 7 is delegated to the cities as intermediate bodies, but often the procedure of selection with a given time line is quite ambitious. Questions concerning the roles of cities and managing authorities arise with a need to improve the process in order to maintain the quality of the integrative and participatory approach at operative level. Questions of interest for the CIA 7 network. Eligibility guidelines and rules are complicated, how to make a detailed implementation plan fit into them? Cohesion policy is the main funding opportunity for some cities, but often connected to many other (national, regional) programmes with different rules. How to coordinate this mix of programme logics including different time frames, risks and delays at operative level? ERDF funded activities receive support from the Managing Authority, which is often a question of policy visibility for the integrated strategy. But concrete actions have to be adapted at local level. How to improve this step? In the MA calls for projects, the group of potential beneficiaries is limited, but for the selection of actions the time line at local level is often narrow. How to work on this challenge? 
3.5 PPP – Setting up Public Private Partnerships for delivery (optional challenge no. 5)
 Private actors and civil society, like (citizen) foundations, local business associations, welfare organisations, (municipal) housing and real estate economy are key stakeholders, as mentioned in chapter 3.2. When implementing an integrated strategy the support of all relevant groups is necessary. Framework conditions for successful local development are complex, making it even more urgent that all players communicate effectively with each other. The dialogue between new and/or established partners in the area is an important success factor. This should be distinguished from classic Public-Private Partnership schemes as a contractual cooperation form between public domain and private enterprises. The RegGov report on public-private partnership in integrated urban policy quotes a definition of the Danish Enterprise and Construction Authority stressing the shared risks and the long-term perspective: “Public-Private Partnership is a method to handle public tasks that require long-term investment. The idea is to invite bids for design, financing, construction, operation, maintenance and services as one project up to 30 years. The private and public partners share the risks related to the project, which means that every risk is handled by the party that can do it in the best and least expensive manner.” (RegGov 2009, p. 12) Motivations of Public Private Partnership can been reassumed as follows (Ramsden 2016): Source of potential investment in the face of limited public budgets. Move infrastructure funding off the public balance sheet. Finance and deliver infrastructure better / deliver Value for Money. Realize more value from public assets (value creation and capture) – More efficiency / effectiveness in services (poor public performance record). Lack of alternatives (human and financial capacity) to deliver infrastructure by public sector In a recent study on PPP and good practice in Italy eight cases on different activity fields have been described, parking areas, photovoltaic facilities, public illumination, kindergarten, cemetery services, tourist ports, sport facilities, social housing (EPAS 2015). In the same study one of the main challenges of PPP is highlighted. Public administration is not always prepared for financial issues or contractual negotiation concerning big infrastructure projects, competence and capacity building needs are high. The recommendation for city administrations is to experience even smaller PPP projects which might have a positive impact on the local territory with an effect in terms of capacity building (EPAS 2015, p. 19).
 3.6 PROCUREMENT – Designing smart public procurement frameworks (optional challenge no. 6) 
Procurement is used by public purchasers at local level (e.g. city councils, universities, hospitals) to commission goods and services from private and social sector organisations. Neves (2009) highlights the opportunities of the European level moving to an innovative public procurement approach. The EU public procurement strategy adopted on April, 18 2016 includes new opportunities for integrated urban development. Social and environmental goals (social procurement, green procurement) and public procurement of innovation are encouraged (Rok 2016). Procurement is an important part of the implementation and delivery process. “With public expenditure on goods, works, and services representing approximately 14% of EU GDP with an annual value of nearly €2 trillion, public procurement is critical to the European economic recovery. Transparent, fair, and competitive public procurement across the Single Market creates business opportunities for European enterprises and contributes to economic growth and job creation.” http://ec.europa.eu/growth/single-market/public-procurement/ strategy_en The URBACT network PROCURE - Creating a good local economy through procurement, in the state of the art document (March 2016) stresses the importance of working on smart procurement strategies of cities. The purpose of the Procure network is to support cities to enhance procurement processes so that they bring greater benefits for their city economy and in social and environmental terms. Lublin, one of the CIA 7 partners, is also participating in this network and can link to the contents where useful and necessary. In the procurement process, PROCURE identifies ways of maximising benefit for city economies in socioeconomic and environmental terms across Europe: Developing procurement strategies with a common narrative. Developing accessible portals. Packaging contracts to make them more accessible. Streamlining procurement documentation. Using social and environmental criteria (PROCURE 2016, p. 16-17) 
3.7 FINANCIAL INNOVATION - Enhancing funding of urban policies by exploring financial innovation (optional challenge no. 7)
 The use of innovative financial instruments can give new opportunities and impulses to urban development strategies. This issue always concerns questions of transparency and accountability. There is a variety of financial tools which are being tested and need to be further explored. With the complexity to be tackled under Article 7 and the timing of the performance from strategy to implementation challenges and benefits of new financial instruments and arrangements need to be carefully analysed. Is it targeted for the local needs? In terms of risk assessment, how are benefits and losses distributed? Some of the CIA 7 partners have made experiences and exchanges on innovative financial tools in different contexts. The European Metropole of Lille and the City of Seville participated in the CSI Europe network. Their conclusions include the fact that financial instruments are less flexible than grant in terms of the types of project they can support due to their requirement for repayment. Projects must be able to deliver value which will ultimately enable the project promoter to repay the investment (CSI Europe 2015). The first continental European Social Impact Bond, for social programmes run by an agency and financed by investors, was applied in Augsburg, Germany in 2013. An agreement was made with the public sector stipulating payment of a premium if predefined, empirically measurable objectives are achieved (pay for success). Implementation was made possible through the support of non-profit financiers, whose upfront funding plus a small amount of interest would only be repaid if the project was a success. The pilot project focused on disadvantaged, unemployed adolescents, a defined number of them had to be placed in apprenticeships or gainful employment. In this case, the recirculation of funds increased the possibilities for social engagement (Juvat 2016). Micro financing, micro credits and peer-to-peer lending have been tackled at neighbourhood level in the RegGov Case study of Duisburg on micro-credits (RegGov 2011, p. 55-62). In this case a financial instrument has been used to connect issues of local economy and unemployment with spatial problems in deprived neighbourhoods. Establishing a microfinance system at neighbourhood level requires partners at different levels, and it needs to be stimulated by public subsidies. From these experiences it can only be seen as an additional instrument to strengthen local economy. Crowd funding or crowd sourcing are new ways to activate and encourage shared funding from the citizens. Even if the use in urban development projects is still experimental, the Rotterdam Luchtsingel bridge case shows a very special idea and project design which has led to a success. http://inhabitat.com/rotterdamswooden- luchtsingel-footbridge-is-a-fantastic-piece-of-crowdfunding-architecture/ These kinds of innovative funding tools are examples of the potential lying in them for integrated urban development strategies. Still they are often in an experimental or pilot phase, and in need of strong ideas and a local participation culture. These new financial tools in most of the CIA 7 partner cities are an additional option which rises regulation and coordination issues and time frames to the complexity which most of the Article 7 arrangements are dealing with. 
LEARNING BY DOING – CITIES IN ARTICLE 7 
The urban dimension of cohesion policy in the programming period 2014-2020 has been stressed by new instruments in the Operational Programmes for sustainable development in cities. The emphasis on territorial approaches has been reinforced compared to the period 2007-2013. Cities are given more attention within the ERDF regulation, functional and (sub-) regional areas with specific challenges and topics are taken more into account. It is demanding for cities to take over “learning by doing” new administrative responsibilities and the lead for participative processes within innovative arrangements and often newly established functional areas, like required within Article 7. What remains to be explored is if and how cities can make best use of the new and ambitious tools at their disposal when at the same time they have to adopt new selection procedures and fulfil additional administrative responsibilities. The flexibility of regulations intended at European level opened space for national guidance. This did not always lead to simplified and tailor-made solutions for the involved urban areas but to an extension of requirements to what is already perceived to be a rather complex mechanism. The empowerment of urban areas giving them more responsibility in the implementation of the OP (e.g. as intermediate bodies) is a big opportunity but also a big challenge to cities. In fact, the development of urban integrated strategies requires many competences such as knowledge on European funds and their management but at the same time on the cross-sector strategy's themes. To summarise it briefly, the Implementation Network CIA 7 shares integrated practices from planning to implementation and funding under Article 7 of ERDF regulation which gives cities the capacity to develop livable urban areas through integrated strategies: This is a very challenging quality shift and management innovation, but at the same time a huge opportunity strengthening and empowering cities.

"CREATIVE SPIRITS.
BOOSTING CREATIVE ENTREPRENEURSHIP THROUGH CREATIVE-BASED URBAN STRATEGIES.
CREATIVE SPIRITS is a network of nine European cities, funded by the European Union in the frame of the URBACT III Programme. The nine CREATIVE SPIRITS partner cities have a common need to improve the implementation of their existing integrated urban strategies/action plans by including novel approaches linked to creative and cultural industries (CCI) – creative places, people and businesses. The joint policy challenge for the network is to better facilitate the above “creative ecosystem” to be able to attract (more) creative entrepreneurs and boost creative entrepreneurship in dedicated urban areas.
INTRODUCTION: CREATIVITY AS A NEW PATHWAY TO LOCAL DEVELOPMENT. 
Almost all Europeans know that culture and creativity are essential elements of the European identity, but only few of them have been enlightened that they are just as essential for the European economy as well. This “knowledge gap” or misbelief has deep roots in our history and indeed politicians as well as professionals have long overlooked the importance and potential of the cultural and creative industries (CCI) too. 
Since the adoption of the European Agenda for Culture in 2007, a key objective of the European Commission has been to promote Europe as a global hub of creativity and culture, while safeguarding and promoting European cultural diversity. In a 2012 policy communication, the Commission invited EU countries, regions and major cities to promote their cultural and creative sectors for creating opportunities and enhancing growth, and in the past few years, an increasing number of EU countries and cities have been developing strategies to fully tap the potential of these sectors. 
In addition to this, cultural and creative industries are strongly dependent on location and feeding on local traditions, and therefore they are especially suitable for the dynamic use of the inward energies of a city and the generation of truly bottom-up development processes. This is why CCIs are increasingly viewed as a key component of local economic development. At the crossroads of art, business and technology, they act as a catalyst and an innovation engine, with benefits that strengthen the broader economy. 
This is the point where cities and municipalities as the most local forms of the government have a key role. Cities are a privileged terrain because of their dense networks of interacting people, markets and activities. The city as a whole functions as a sort of creative field, in which information flow with special intensity between the diverse units of economic and social activity contained in the urban space. 
The nine CREATIVE SPIRITS partner cities have a common need to improve the implementation of their existing integrated urban strategies/action plans dedicated to a given “creative place”, by including novel approaches linked to creative and cultural industries (CCI) – creative places, people and businesses. The joint policy challenge for the network is to better facilitate the above “creative ecosystem” to be able to attract (more) creative entrepreneurs and boost creative entrepreneurship in dedicated urban areas. 
This paper, as the first chapter of the Baseline Study - which also consists of partner city profiles and a synthesis -, presents a broad and practical picture of the current state of play related to the above policy challenge. By highlighting economic and urban trends, introducing policy guidelines and successful policies and good practices related to the implementation related challenges partners potentially cope with, it intends to help partner cities to overcome these challenges and contribute to the improvement of their existing urban strategies or action plans. This paper hopefully will establish the existing knowledge base on which the CREATIVE SPIRITS network can build an effective exchange and learning process.
1. THE CREATIVE ECOSYSTEM AND WHAT IS BEHIND: CREATIVE INDUSTRIES, CREATIVE PLACES AND CREATIVE PEOPLE. 
1.1. The cultural and creative industries. 
The economic weight of cultural and creative industries is significant. According to the latest, comprehensive report done by Ernst and Young (2014), the creative and cultural industries contribute 4.2% to Europe’s GDP, and account for nearly 7 million jobs, primarily in small businesses. CCIs are the third-largest by people in employment, after construction and food and beverage service activities. In 2013, the CCIs employed, on average, more 15-29-year-olds than any other sector. What is more, the sectors in the creative economy have been resilient during the economic crisis and in particular as a source for youth employment. In Eastern and Central Europe, the trend is even more pronounced where on average, young people account for 1.3% more jobs in the creative economy than in the rest of the economy. Interestingly, the highest revenue is generated by a purely cultural sector: visual arts (much more than for example, the film industry). 
The resilience of CCIs was evident during the economic crisis: job creation in CCIs grew on average by 3.5% a year from 2000 to 2007, and continued to grow at 0.7% annually between 2008 and 2012, even as the number of jobs in the rest of the economy fell 0.7%. Regarding urban policies the untapped potential for youth employment needs to be emphasized because CCIs are both highly attractive for young people and open to young workers and can absorb them easily. As this report shows, with regards to reinforcing CCIs politicians’ ambition is to re-position Europe as a global hub of creativity and talents. 
At the crossroads of art, business and technology, CCIs act as a catalyst and an innovation engine, with benefits that strengthen the broader economy. Regarding cities, it is worth mentioning the example how CCIs can contribute to tourism: across the EU, the holiday plans of one out of every three tourists is heavily shaped by available cultural attractions. If a “creative district” exists in a city, it may attract the majority of visitors. 
1.2. Creative people 
The so called ‘creative class’ consists of creative people and it is not strictly associated to qualified people, but comprises all type of workers whose job is to create meaningful new forms, independently of their formal education. They can be craftsmen, makers, organisers, IT specialist, cultural entrepreneurs – but the focus of the creative entrepreneur differs from that of the typical business entrepreneur or, indeed, the social entrepreneur in that s/he is concerned first and foremost with the creation and exploitation of creative or intellectual capital. Essentially, creative entrepreneurs are investors in talent – their own or other people’s, and often they do not identify themselves as entrepreneurs. This is why traditional SME support approaches do not always work in the field of CCIs.
1.3. Creative places 
Creative place is a location where creative and cultural industries are present and active. In a creative place “inspiration comes from interaction between creatives, from a vibrant scene and, most often, from the proximity of cultural institutions that are usually a flagship in such areas”. (Cerar (ed.), 2013) Creative place can be on various territorial scales such as creative cities, districts, quartiers or hubs. Practically, creative-based development “was born” some decades ago during the redevelopment processes of abandoned industrial sites - that had once served crafts production (textiles, ceramics) - towards creative hubs. 
According to Charles Landry (2000) the creative city “identifies, nurtures, attracts and sustains talent so it is able to mobilise ideas, talents and creative organizations. The built environment – the stage and the setting - is crucial for establishing the milieu”. A creative milieu is a place that contains the necessary requirements in terms of hard (built environment, institutions and services that provide the atmosphere) and soft (skilled and flexible workers, dynamic thinkers, makers, creators and strong communication flow among them) factors – infrastructure - to generate a flow of ideas and inventions. A milieu can be a building, a street, an area, a city or a region. A creative district can be defined by applying the above noted definition at the district level whilst emphasising the importance of community. “The creative milieu is not just about bricks and mortar; it is about the flow of ideas, which takes place within and between creative communities. The emphasis is on the notion of bonding and bridging social capital” (Cerar (ed.), 2013). A creative district is a place (physically) shared by different creative communities, providing them with the possibility of getting together, mutual inspiring and testing ideas. 
Creative districts have often been developed as a slower step-by-step process, based on local resources and local demand. City authorities should seek to transform empty buildings and lands into spaces dedicated to the creative industries and rent them at preferential rates. City centres are also often attractive for creative people as well as bottom-up “creative hubs” equipped with the above characteristics have the best potential to create an inspiring environment for dynamic companies, entrepreneurship and open innovation. 
1.4. The creative ecosystem. 
The growing relationship between creativity and territory leads to the introduction of the concept of creative ecosystem which is, as described in the final study of the URBACT Creative Clusters network, “an environment of excellence based on creative assets that generates socio-economic growth and development, and comprises three interlinked components: economy (creative industries), place (creative spaces) and people (creative talent). Such interaction depends largely on the specific governance systems and institutional arrangements, and that of their position in the spatial system and urban hierarchies, and their level of access to information and communication technologies” (INTELI, 2011). More simply: creative places (translated into the urban space) can attract talented, creative people as they appreciate open, tolerant and vibrant atmosphere. But building up a creative urban space is not enough: providing space for collaboration and nurturing creativity and entrepreneurship in such a supportive and free environment is also essential.
1.5. How cities can manage the creative ecosystem? 
Municipalities, as the most local forms of the government having a deep knowledge about local needs, should have a reinforced role in the above innovation cycle as facilitators or brokers. They can mediate new relationships and initiate new connections between different competences, fields and sectors. 
Due to the lack of shared values and goals resulted also in different working methods, way of thinking and languages between politicians and creatives often there is a “creative policy gap”. Institutional cooperation at the cross-section of urban development and the creative industries is important and needs to be strengthened at all levels. The role of integrated urban development plans in the establishment of creative industries needs to be elaborated and specific planning measures defined, both at the strategic level as well as in implementation. 
During implementation effective leadership is needed which is not about striving to control what is uncontrollable, rather, it is about creating the conditions for groups, teams, organisations and (even informal) communities to effectively and creatively cope with threats and build opportunities for the whole city. 
Academic research also underpins the required shift in public policies: “in this context, some authors have advocated that it is critical that cultural and creative policies adopt alternative forms of governance (O’Connor & Shaw, 2014 as cited in Romeiro, 2016), “a mode of governance very different from a rule-bound administrative approach or a style of planning and management locked into a culturally homogeneous concept of what a city region should be like” (Healey, 2004 as cited in Romeiro, 2016, p. 13). 
As for the concept on creative cities, the following attributes could be taken into consideration while laying the foundations for a creative milieu and providing a “space” in which creative milieu can flourish. 
Be ready for experiments: similar to social innovators creative people brings an experimental approach to public policy. New initiatives are treated as hypotheses to be tested through prototyping, piloting or other means in order to build enough knowledge about effectiveness to have the confidence to deliver an initiative at scale or more permanently. 
Listen well: public managers can help create an open environment promoting and supporting creativity. Worldwide, a growing number of cities are organising democratic innovation platforms, round tables, pecha-kucha evenings, boot camps, marketplaces or similar matchmaking events to connect citizens’ good ideas with each other and with the administration, to refresh thinking, and to make silent voices audible (the unusual suspect). 
New indicators of success: vast risk assessment literature for investment decisions, but the equivalent for more socially oriented projects remains undeveloped. This means that indicators of cost-effectiveness that go beyond traditional cost-benefit analysis need to be developed. 
Making the most of creative individuals: creative projects are usually driven by committed individuals that cannot work in rigid frameworks. In local authorities this might mean that space and grants for innovation and pilot projects are made available, deliberately shaped to encourage experiment, in which trust is the glue.
Right balance between multiculturalism and localism: in line with Richard Florida’s 3T model (2002), beside talents and technology, the third T refers to tolerance: an open, tolerant atmosphere which is often interrelated with multiculturalism. But do not forget that creativity is often based on local traditions and these can act as a never-ending source of inspiration for creativity. Deep historical legacies that connected a form of crafting to place formed the basis of a contemporary industry. Historical legacies were adapted to enable the cultivation of new markets. And this could occur in performing arts, design, fashion, handicraft, etc. 
Using catalysts and achieve quick-wins: catalyst events and projects can create opportunities for people with different perspectives to come together and share ideas. What the former mayor of Curitiba, Brazil, Jaime Lerner said in connection with ‘urban acupuncture’, meaning that smaller symbolic projects can have an effect in creating points of energy and initiating a snowball effect in a city, is especially relevant regarding CCIs. 
Off culture - in culture: a wide range of academic literature underpin that alternative, underground culture has a strong role in fuelling the creative industries; and close links are built between mainstream knowledge (re)production and underground creativity (Romeiro, 2016). While the in culture is organized and planned, the off one is often said to be spontaneous, it is free of any constraints, so that it becomes extremely creative and innovative. And also there are hundreds of examples how off culture become in culture, but regarding the network topic, the key is how public authorities can manage the process. This is also linked to creative activism. Boosting creative places needs critical balancing between high-level and institutionalised art spaces (e.g. galleries, museums) and grass-root artistic initiatives in order to engage the public. 
Developing creative spaces as incubators: finding buildings to serve as the core infrastructure where creative workers can meet, network, or be trained is rather essential. It may refer to artistic activities as well as other forms of creativity. Many new art forms cannot develop without the creation of some new specialist provision. Clustering such activities in one place or building creates a sense of community and stimulates peer-to-peer learning. 
Creative spaces do not necessarily contribute to rehabilitation: An important assumption often underlying projects stimulating creative entrepreneurship in deprived neighbourhoods is that the presence of creative entrepreneurs contributes to the regeneration of these neighbourhoods. Besides contributing to the economic development of the neighbourhood (Florida, 2000), creative entrepreneurs are also assumed to bring more ‘buzz’ to the neighbourhood, which has a positive effect on the establishment of new cafés, restaurants and shops (Landry, 2000). This is supposed to be important for the quality of life of present and future inhabitants, as well as for attracting visitors, new inhabitants and new enterprises (Montgomery, 2007). However, there is a lot of ongoing debate if initiatives stimulating creative entrepreneurship actually contribute to urban regeneration (Nijkamp, 2016). Based on research in Raval (Barcelona) and Mile End (Montreal), Tremblay and Battaglia (2012, p. 66) mention several characteristics that a cultural quarter should have in order to contribute to the regeneration of an area in the city: 
1. Improve the regeneration of a geographical area; 
2. Cluster, as a physical and creative hub, cultural, social and economic activities; 
3. Act as a catalyst for the production and consumption of cultural services; 
4. Facilitate the participation of local communities; 
5. Support and maintain artists’ galleries and studios, while at the same time protecting the quarter from intensive gentrification and real estate interests; 
6. Improve the quality of life for people living and working in the quarter; 
7. Reinforce local development through partnerships between local institutions and other economic and productive sectors. 
Transformation of dedicated urban areas to creative districts or hubs may also generate city-wide problems, especially if related urban policies behind the transformation process are not managed well. Depending on the location perhaps the biggest risk is gentrification as creative districts often become popular and trendy. People want to live in them and spend their free time in these districts, and thus the amount of ‘city users’ increases. This could eventually lead to a gentrification process.

6. PRELIMINARY CONCLUSIONS.
In chapter 5 the lessons learnt from previous EU cooperation projects, academic research and various case studies with relevant outcomes for the Creative Spirits objective are connected to the implementation related challenges defined by the URBACT programme. These recommendations are to be discussed during the city visits and will be reflected in the city profiles. Accordingly, the Synthesis will fine-tune the project goals as well as the Implementation Challenges to be focused on during Phase 2. Some general overarching conclusions are: 

1. Many creative areas developed on an organic way, starting with temporary use and artistic squatters, but also many of them became more formal over the time and at some points a rather sensitive, conscious and flexible intervention from the municipality is needed. In these areas non-intervention approaches are usually enough to start things up, but after a critical point more policy-driven assistance is also needed, mainly by an intermediate body established by the local government (see Rotterdam’s Creative Factory or Jyväskylä’s consultancy service) who is willing and capable to take a facilitative leading role. This is an important issue to be discussed during the debates in the ULG on how to organise and streamline the participatory approach and multi stakeholder engagement processes. 

2. Creating creative hubs by bringing in creative people from outside will not always result in revitalisation and greater social cohesion. Specific actions are needed to avoid the situation that a new sub-culture is created without a good connection and involvement of local inhabitants and to avoid the risk of gentrification. 

3. The objective of the Creative Spirits network is focussed on creating an environment in which entrepreneurship within the sector can get a boost. This is what partner cities have in common. The sub-objectives however may vary. This requires specific attention during the city visits and the upcoming ULG debates because the variety of sub-challenges creates a more precise basis for future knowledge transfer and learning. 

4. The defined Implementation Challenges in this call are of a general character. It would make sense to also define more sector specific challenges. For the Creative Sector this could be for example the contribution of developing creative clusters or districts to social cohesion of neighbourhoods, the extent to which transfer from voluntary work and activities to real jobs in the sector is a substantial aspect etc. These elements should also be discussed during the City Visits. 

6. The objectives of the partners should be further clarified and specified related to whether creative clustering is expected to contribute to the rehabilitation of deprived areas. This should impact strongly on the (type of) actions to be integrated in the Operative Implementation Frameworks and also in the composition and working methods of the ULG’s. 

7. The integration challenge is quite essential for the Creative Spirits partners because the spill overs from CCI’s to other sectors are quite considerable as shown in many of the case studies. This spill-over effect, the fact that creative-based strategies can interconnect and interact other policy fields, shall be reflected in the composition of ULGs as well.

"INT-HERIT.  
IMPLEMENTATION NETWORK OF HERITAGE STRATEGIES IN SMALL AND MEDIUM-SIZED EUROPEAN CITIES.  
INTRODUCTION.  
The role of culture, heritage and creativity, and their relationship to economic development has been the subject of renewed attention in the European political agenda over the last four decades, in the context of the policy for competitiveness and sustainable development (e.g. the successful case of Bilbau). Cultural heritage is a shared resource, and a common good. Like other such goods it can be vulnerable to over-exploitation and under-funding, which can result in neglect, decay and, in some cases, oblivion. Looking after our heritage is, therefore, our common responsibility. While heritage protection is primarily a matter for national, regional and local authorities, the European Union has a role to play in line with the EU Treaties and in respect of the principle of subsidiarity. (EC COM(2014) 477).  It has been recognized economic benefits and impact of cultural heritage as an economic factor capable of create jobs, catalyse technical innovation and also as a useful tool for regional development. We have also highlighted the social benefits that promote sustainability as well as providing social cohesion and improving the quality of life of citizens (Europa Nostra 2009). Culture plays an important role ""in the production process of places"" (Harvey, 1989), as well as in its differentiation and is also a connecting link between the rural and the urban and an inspiring element of initiatives linked with the economy of the experience.  The development of management strategies is a basic task in public policy. Particularly, in the field of cultural heritage management it has the double sense to ensure the preservation of resources and facilitate their sustainable use through a management process. From a territorial scale, we can distinguish three levels (Rypkema, 2016): a macro-level where structural and regulatory measures are programmed from the state; a second one, starring regions , districts or other territorial units through the creation of regional plans and strategies and finally, there is a third level or micro-level by municipalities or entities responsible for managing individual sites, proposing in this case action plans and local management, combining measures of protection and use, usually with an eye on the medium term and with community participatory processes. 
1. THE 5 DIMENSIONS OF CULTURAL HERITAGE  
When thinking on economic development in small to medium size cities, cultural heritage always plays an important role in any city strategy, particularly in historical towns where the valorisation of cultural heritage remains as one of the best tools to promote social and economic development. However several factors such as lack of funding, lack of management expertise, etc, are preventing these cities to fully exploit its potential, limiting the capacity to valorise these important assets.  Small to medium-size cities are facing, in a context of crisis and institutional reorganization of local government, different challenges linked to the revitalization of cultural heritage through innovative actions, which are able to provide operational tools and tracking systems, encourage alliances between stakeholders, promote employment and entrepreneurship in the creative sectors, experiment with innovative public procurement initiatives and attract new funding and governance models.  The following diagram illustrate these dynamics where the 5 identified Project Dimensions run in a flywheel that rotates around an operational framework composed by the Strategic Plans of the cities (as input), methods to engage stakeholders according to the selected dimension, explore solutions to tackle implementation challenges under a Results Framework, linking actions to results and a Monitoring system to measure performance of the implementation. The EU policy to support cultural heritage as a tool for development provided the means to rehabilitate extremely important patrimony across all European countries. Through existent financial tools (structural funds, etc) and better governance models (administrative reforms, etc), city authorities are more and more in charge of important cultural heritage sites, many times initiating the process of rehabilitation or being responsible for managing it afterwards.  However, this puts pressure on the city budget and new models of managing cultural heritage should be sought in order to work around the limitation of resources and assure the continuity of projects. By exploring these 5 dimensions, cities will look for better ways of fully explore the potential of the targeted sites and through knowledge exchange will receive support to tackle implementation challenges ahead.  In the following sections of this document will discuss the 5 Project Dimensions, concerning their function, utility, economic potential, etc, in order to help INT-HERIT partners to integrate their local sceneries to a network that will share a set of common goals and an operational framework to better assess the implementation hurdles faced by cities, particularly small to medium-size cities as in the case of the INT-HERIT network.  
1.1 CULTURE for DEVELOPMENT.  
Cities throughout the world are exploring the ways that arts and culture can serve as an economic engine, build name recognition and become a source of civic pride. Through a mix of policy, branding and economic development, these cities have the opportunity to create economic growth and a more vibrant quality of life by incorporating public art, theatres, festivals, cultural districts, the repurposing of buildings and land, and other amenities into their planning and policy implementation in order to promote job creation and entrepreneurship.  
1.1.1 CULTURAL HERITAGE MANAGEMENT IN SMALL TO MEDIUM-SIZE CITIES? 
 Currently almost every EU city has included cultural heritage in their strategic plans as an important tool to foster development. From the renovation of historical buildings, rehabilitation of decaying areas (e.g. the docks projects in London and Lisbon) to recovering of the immaterial heritage as traditions, ancient know-how, craftsmanship, gastronomy, etc., almost every strategic plan explores one or several aspects of conservation and valorisation of their cultural heritage. Successful cases are not hard to find across Europe and they provide evidence of the importance of cultural heritage as one of the best tools available to foster social and economic development of cities (e.g. the «Jacobeo» tourism strategy of Galicia in Spain, taking advantage of the St. James pilgrim route to Santiago de Compostela). Initially it seemed that these innovative approaches could be easily transfer to other cities or regions, including smaller cities, as the ones participating in the INT-HERIT network, that outnumbers big cities and consequently could have an important impact in the territorial cohesion of EU countries. In fact, despite their size, many of them have quite important cultural heritage to preserve and manage (e.g. the partner city Dodoni in Greece, with only about 10.000 inhabitants, has one of the most important archaeological sites of ancient Greece, classified as World Heritage by UN). However, due to several factors as lack of critical mass, resources, etc, small to medium-size cities struggle to reach sustainability of projects on cultural heritage. It’s not just a matter of money, as regional, national and EU funds have always give attention and supportive of projects around cultural heritage due to the obvious importance of keeping our common heritage for future generations. It’s also a matter of given a good use to the buildings or areas to be rehabilitated, manage efficiently the allocated resources, promote entrepreneurship and related businesses (namely in in tourism sector) and explore the spill overs of the project such as changes in the involvement of citizens and their perception of the cultural heritage of their own cities, to name a few.  A common concern on any city is how to assure the sustainability of projects. Available funds provide the financial capacity to move projects forward but they cannot provide knowledge or solutions on how to turn them sustainable, leaving municipalities with the difficult task to find ways to explore the multiple dimensions of development projects around cultural heritage. This model of financing projects usually leads to a situation where municipalities have to assume all operational and maintenance costs that can rapidly growth to unbearable figures for their budgets. This means that in this model there are a limited number of projects they can promote before running out of resources. This limitation leads to a paradox where municipalities can get the money to renovate or rehabilitate the sites but no enough money to keep them operating and have to drop them. This is particularly important in small to medium-size cities where resources are usually scarce and the chances to reach sustainability are hampered by the lack of critical mass in the city to make them viable. In the European and national area of historical cities, it has already been recognized (see for example the results and recommendations of HerO Project - URBACT II), the need for a new management approach in the field of integrated urban development to unclog the potential of cultural heritage to be widely transformed into benefits on the territory. 
1.1.2 PROMOTE EMPLOYMENT AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP.  
The Strategies or Plans to be implemented must rely on different prototypes already tested in small and medium sized cities, to gain scale and disseminate new arguments to support a change in the cultural heritage management model. In short, there’s the need to activate a spiralling strategy of social innovation applied to small and medium sized European cities. Also creating local groups to boost employment opportunities around cultural heritage is an interesting strategy as it was proposed by the URBACT project JobTown. Enhance learning, validation of skills and qualifications, as well as the development of learning strategies and entrepreneurship should be foreseen. By exploiting best practices in other areas such as entrepreneurship and micro-enterprise and SME competitiveness, for their adaptation in the field of cultural heritage management and promote training experiences in an area of culture heritage where professional certifications are underdeveloped, potentially leading to initiatives that may serve as a test for their ability to be translated and subsequently implemented in specific sectorial policies at the regional and national level. To foster development in small cities through cultural heritage a new slim approach is necessary, an approach that’s highly efficient in spending resources while targeting specific results, surely less impressive that the results obtained in big cities but that may create effective impact on the local community by promoting business, tourism and social innovation. This game of alliances connected with the forms of participation and governance area the core of every cultural heritage management strategy. 
1.2 CULTURE for ENGAGEMENT  
1.2.1 COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT. “Conservation is increasingly geared towards preserving and enhancing a whole cultural landscape rather than an isolated site, and also becoming more people-centred. Old approaches sought to protect heritage by isolating it from daily life. New approaches focus on making it fully part of the local community. Sites are given a second life and meaning that speak to contemporary needs and concerns. “(EC COM(2014) 477).  One of the main objectives of the project is to raise awareness among actors to new strategies for cultural heritage management, namely to how an integrated approach could maximize their results in terms of rehabilitation and maintenance of cultural assets as well as in the involvement of the city communities, from business to citizens, in order to produce an endured impact in the social and economic landscape of the city.  This is particularly important for in small and medium- sized European cities as those that form the INT-HERIT project consortium, as the cultural heritage’ projects will have a greater impact in these cities rather than in a big city. This will also favours metrics since it will make it easier to measure impact of the operational action-plans. Each city has its own different projects but all partners want to take advantage of the INT-HERIT Implementation Network to “inject” in their projects a participative and integrative approach to cultural heritage management in order to provide a clear path from strategy to the operational action-plan. Rather than relying only on hard indicators that are easy to collect but that are many times entirely out of the scope of a project time period (and therefore should not be turned into expected results), it is also important to look for the intangible results and spill overs of a project as INT-HERIT, for instance by “measuring” the changes in perception of all stakeholders and in particular of citizens towards the importance of preserving our cultural heritage. In fact, if a project has a deficient engagement of the local community it often leads to citizen’s opposition to the project and ultimately to affect the potential impact of the project. It is very common to hear such complaints as “excessive” investment, bad architectural options, wrong reuse of the building, etc. This lack of stakeholder management since the starting point of the project is critical in cultural heritage as this is an area where the sense of belonging is quite strong among citizens. As community members, they feel they own their share of that heritage and being a kind of “shareholder” means they also want to take part of the decisions. By involving the local community in a project from the start provides the best guarantee of success as possible pit-falls will be identified early in the project and therefore easy to avoid or at least more cost effective to work around than at the end of timeline. But most important is the promotion of a sense of co-responsibility and ownership among citizens that will be crucial to achieve the sustainability of the project in the long-term. 
1.2.2 VOLUNTEER STRATEGIES.  
Volunteers are found in every area and level of cultural heritage work. Some organisations involve volunteers in small numbers; some have extensive and well-established volunteer programmes which complement the work of paid staff; others may be staffed entirely by volunteers.  Volunteering represents an important resource and a meaningful indicator of participation and awareness as well as of personal and social development; it is one of the bricks which compose the complex building that we call active citizenship. Furthermore, cultural institutions – and particularly museums - have dramatically changed in the last few years. They provide public services and have a social function which is more enhanced today than in the past. They relate to new audiences and new ways of communicating; they promote social cohesion and inclusion; they offer cultural mediation for visitors who come from different backgrounds and cultures, who have diverse previous knowledge and use different interpretative strategies. 
1.3 CULTURE for VALUE.  
Cultural heritage provides an important contribution to economic growth and social cohesion. Its value - both intrinsic and economic – comes from exploring several dimensions; cultural, physical, digital, environmental, human and social. As political and economic schemes fail to solve the problems of development, inequality, and citizen participation, policy makers are asking culture do what other activities can’t.  
1.3.1 CREATING VALUE THROUGH CULTURE HERITAGE.  
According to the European Construction Industry Federation, in 2016 renovation and maintenance represented 27.7% of the value of Europe's construction industry1. UK studies have shown that the historic environment can offer a high return on investment: each £1 invested generating up to £1.60 of additional economic activity over ten years2.  Heritage has spill-over effects in other economic sectors. Tourism is estimated to contribute €415 billion to the EU GDP3 and 3.4 million tourism enterprises account for 15.2 million jobs4 – many linked to heritage, directly or indirectly. Cultural heritage is a key factor in choosing a travel destination. According to the Eurobarometer Survey on the attitudes of Europeans towards tourism published in March 2016, ‘Sun/Beach’ is still the main reason to travel abroad with 39% of the preferences but ‘City Trips’ with 27% and ‘Culture (e.g. Religious, Gastronomy, Art) with 26% are right behind meaning that the selection of their holiday destination is more and more based on the cultural heritage of the site. Furthermore, 31% of choose cultural heritage as the main reason to return to a place (against only 26% in 2012), meaning that cultural heritage factor is gaining importance at the time of deciding where to go on their holydays1. Cultural heritage can therefore help brand cities and regions while attracting talent and tourism.  
1.3.2 PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS (PPP’S) AND NEW FINANCIAL MODELS 
 Conservation of cultural heritage requires the involvement of multiple players across the public, private and third sectors, not only to initiate and carry out conservation but also to foster the sustainability of projects. The conservation of historic urban environments poses specific and urgent challenges that require a multidisciplinary approach, where conservation actions are embedded in economic, social and environmental development strategies. The private and third sectors are increasingly playing a pivotal role in these processes (Macdonald, 2011).  Financial Innovation became a crucial tool in the scope of cultural heritage management. It is widely used today in all EU countries, however new and innovative ways of making PPP’s arrangements namely through active participation of citizens will provide new solutions for the sustainability of cultural heritage. PPP’s play a key role in our strategy for cultural heritage management as it will impact greatly on the capacity of raising financial support and to maximize the social economic impact in the city, namely in the promotion of new business around the sector and ultimately in job creation. Knowledge exchange between cities, i.e. learning from others’ experiences will provide cities with new arrangements and new form of agreements never though before providing them the capacity to build long-term PPP’s. However it remains a challenge to involve private partners without losing grip on quality, identity and sustainability of the concerned heritage.  Each sector can contribute in multiple ways: Public Sector: by providing sufficient incentives (ownership of assets, additional co-funding) and a secure legal framework to attract private capital transaction; establish a system of protection of economic long-term assets; promoting formulas of total or partial occupation of the sites; make improvements in the surrounding areas; rethink public policies, etc. Private sector: private initiative can contribute in different ways; debt financing; add its sectorial experience; participation in shared forms of use and management, etc. Third Sector: identification of heritage sites in poor condition, use and management; pressure and political support; experience in conservation; support in the communication of the plan or strategy; contribution to a position of equilibrium in the presence of a new sector among stakeholder, etc.   
1.4 CULTURE for MEASURE.  
The cultural sector is one of the most refractory when it comes to generating hard data on economic impact, employment, and social benefits. To be sure, many claims are made in these regards, and just as many critiques. Cultural administrations generally have been more interested in supporting production, with little regard to distribution and reception. The valorisation of cultural heritage carry many positive external effects; however they don’t always impact transversely and in the long term on other sectors, most notably in tourism and creative industries. Understanding and measuring these impacts is therefore mandatory to make these policies more effective.  
1.4.1 BUILDING AN OPERATIONAL FRAMEWORK.  
The cities in the INT-HERIT network share a lot in common but they have quite different levels of development and are in different stages of application of these multidisciplinary approaches, leading to different strategic plans and expected results. Therefore, the operational framework will be adapted to the situation of each city although sharing the same methodology of measuring and monitoring. The main goal here is to connect actions to concrete results in a comprehensive way. This will allow cities to effectively address the challenges they have identified in relation to the implementation process. This output will be composed of the concrete solutions and policy instruments that were adopted. This operational framework will thus be both a driver to the exchange and learning activities and a key concrete output that will lead to an enhanced delivery of their urban strategy/ action plan. It will allow cities to effectively address the challenges they have identified in relation to the implementation process and measure its impacts in the life of citizens.  
1.4.2 MONITORING AND EVALUATION  
A priority area is development of cultural indicators, which will presumably displace the overemphasis on the economic impact of cultural investment. Indicators research includes information on the diffusion or concentration of cultural practice and consumption; gauging security defined in terms of social cohesiveness, conviviality, voluntary work, aspects of spontaneous cultural initiatives, occupation of public spaces, with a focus on the degree to which people associate in public; cultural quality of life (not to be understood as exclusively quality of cultural life), measuring the extent of communication among people, the existence of good cinemas, good heritage (memory), proximity to artists, enjoyment of public space; cultural rights, a factor not usually found in States’ charters and institutions, includes but is not limited to freedom of expression since there should also be a right to be listened to, a right to diversity of language and expressive modes, and even the negative right that one’s cultural space should not be used for publicity, which is a problem in tourism.  Several different set of indicators could be used to assess the social and economic impact of culture and creative sectors worldwide, however there is no single index that could be accepted and used across the globe. As a consequence benchmarking cities in these sectors become quite a difficult task to handle.  In this context, the European Commission through its Joint Research Centre (JRC), together with the OECD, has published a “Handbook on Constructing Composite Indicators: Methodology and User Guide” which has become the reference report for practitioners constructing composite indicators in a variety of fields as for instance the Global Innovation Index (INSEAD & World Intellectual Property Organisation). Recently, the European Commission has promoted the development of a monitoring tool for the culture and creative sectors in convergence of interests of several stakeholders, establishing a common evidence-base for understanding and monitoring cultural and creative initiatives resulting in the creation of Cultural and Creative Cities Index (still a working name).  The key features of the index are: full transparency and availability to the public; detailed interpretation of results and city profiles; benchmarking with peer cities based on economic level and population size; conceptual and statistical coherence; availability in two complementary versions - a “standardised” and a “flexible” one. The Cultural and Creative Cities Index will hopefully provide a workbench for research, e.g. of cultural potentials of different segments of the population.  The project Cultural Heritage Counts for Europe: Towards an European Index for Valuing Cultural Heritage, funded by the EU Culture programme and launched in 2013 is another attempt to build a new index to assess impacts of culture heritage in the socio and economic development of the EU.  On 3 February 2016, the European Commission’s Competence Centre on composite indicators and scoreboards (COIN) was launched. COIN brings together scientific and analytical expertise that can be applied across policy areas. The competence centre examines available methodology within its remit, and provides Commission services with quality-controlled tools that support the conception, implementation and evaluation of EU policy. COIN includes the provision of support and assistance to policy DGs, as well as technical training. Best practices are to be shared across services via communities of practice. Furthermore, COIN will strengthen and extend its strong networks with academia, external research organisations, and practitioners in other policy-making institutions, to remain mainstream in its expertise and to provide the Commission with state-of-the-art scientific methodology (https://ec.europa.eu/jrc/en).  In conclusion, results indicators will provide a proxy to measure the change in development to be achieved in the future through the policy intervention. It will provide evidence and guidance throughout the implementation and will help to address challenges in a methodological way by establishing a tool to measure success, identify gaps and knowledge needs and build a comprehensive analysis on the sustainability of projects beyond its pure financial performance.  
 1.5 CULTURE for POLICIES. 
 In 2007, the concept of Cultural Heritage became an official EU priority with the European Agenda for Culture. The Council of Europe highlighted in its “Conclusions”1 cultural heritage “as a strategic resource for a sustainable Europe” and listed the social and economic benefits of policies regarding heritage, calling increasing attention to the topic. The European Parliament strongly supported the idea, and consequently, the European Commission presented its first proposal for a European Year of Cultural Heritage in August 2016. On 9 February 2017, a provisional agreement was reached by the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament, declaring 2018 as the European Year of Cultural Heritage.  The main goals of the European Year are first of all “to promote cultural diversity, intercultural dialogue and social cohesion”, highlighting the importance of economic contribution of our cultural heritages to both the cultural sector, as well as the creative one, and emphasizing the role of our cultural heritages in the EU’s external relations.  Definitely the INT-HERIT project comes in good timing as its implementation will be simultaneously with this initiative, creating opportunities to maximize its outcomes and it will not only directly benefit the participant cities but ultimately many other cities of similar size in the EU that may apply the knowledge and the tools (e.g. monitoring system) that will be developed within the project in order to better manage and valorise cultural heritage in these cities.  
1.5.1 GOVERNANCE MODELS FOR SMALL AND MEDIUM-SIZE CITIES  
Most academic studies, theoretical models or policy documents that focus on the relationship between cities, heritage and integrated development concentrate on metropolis and big cities, in detriment of small and medium cities. Even developed analysis models are not suitable for implementation in the process of analysing these cities. It is true however, that there some exceptions of small and medium-sized cities that introduce a change in their local strategy (see URBACT Project Creative Clusters), incorporating the field of creative industries in their vision, which undoubtedly affects their governance model. The recognition of the potential role of small cities in the creativity movement is particularly relevant because these territories have a huge quantitative importance in terms of population and land area. For example, in the European Union (EU) approximately 40% of the population lives in small urban areas (from 10,000 to 50,000 inhabitants) and 20% in medium-sized cities (between 50,000 and 250,000 inhabitants). The integration of the role of culture in the plans and strategies of small and medium-sized cities can provide the framework for understanding their current context and its peculiarities where heritage can be a natural catalyst (Tomaz, 2011).  In recent decades, many small and medium-size European cities have used Community funding (ERDF in particular, but also LEADER in small and medium-sized cities) to carry out conservation actions and valorisation of cultural heritage. Unlike large cities that include these activities in integrated plans and strategies, small and medium-sized cities rarely articulate plans that can be designed, implemented and evaluated.  Cultural heritage processes involves so many stakeholders that many times it becomes impossible to address all of them. Several governmental agencies and other related organizations play crucial roles in these processes turning horizontal and vertical integration a key challenge of the network. Cultural heritage management is often under a very strict legal framework requiring a strong interaction between local authorities and regional/national authorities to move projects forward. Another crucial aspect is territorial integration particularly when addressing tourism development as it usually falls under a regional or trans-regional strategy.  An integrated approach would help them to maximize the results both in terms of rehabilitation and maintenance of the cultural heritage and as well as a better involvement of the city communities, from business to citizens, in order to produce an endured impact in the social and economic landscape of the city. This is particularly important in small and medium- sized European cities as those that form the INT-HERIT project consortium, in which cultural heritage projects usually have a greater impact in relation that happens in big cities. Each city has a different strategy plan but all partners can take advantage of the INT-HERIT Implementation Network to “inject” in their projects a participative and integrative approach to cultural heritage management in order to provide a clear path from strategy to the operational action-plan. 
1.5.2 LINK WITH OTHER SECTORS.  
Valorisation of cultural heritage always has positive effects in the tourism and creative industries.However in the digital era that we are living today innovative approaches are required to fully exploit the potential of these external effects. Today more and more cultural heritage institutions are beginning to explore the added value of sharing data and the open data movement is now a reality, becoming a true catalyst for bringing other sectors to cultural heritage management and exploitation. In Europe, the British Museum of London was the first English museum to develop databases available online. Since 2007, indeed, it implements a Collection Online by means of which it is possible to search images and records via a “work in progress database”, as defined by the museum itself. In Amsterdam, since 2011 the Rijks Museum has been working at the “Open Archives Initiative”, including digital images and over 110.000 metadata, such as ID number, date of creation, title and subject of the work. Accessing these data requires the user to authenticate on the Rijks Studio website. In Turin, the Fondazione Torino Musei opened its data under CreativeCommons Italia licence with the aim of «transparency, spread information, usability and knowledge sharing on art and cultural heritage»1. More recently (on the 7th of February 2017), the Metropolitan Museum of Art, one of the largest art museums in the world announced its release of 375,000 images to the public domain. Their open access program sets a new gold standard for digital museum practice. With it, they recognize that their collection is made up of artefacts created by the peoples of the world. By releasing their digital copies they are placing that collection where it belongs — in the hands of the people. When a heavyweight like The Met embraces open access, the rest of the museum world is bound to follow its lead. As Ryan Merkley (CEO of Creative Commons) clearly put it: “Sharing is fundamental to promote discovery, innovation, and collaboration in the digital age.” All these initiatives exposes cultural heritage to a lot more people than before fostering synergies and collaborations with other sectors and citizens. The positive side effect is the involvement of other stakeholders in the preservation and valorisation of culture heritage, namely through the creation of new enterprises and expose the sector to extremely dynamic industries around web development. By making the results of human creativity from all times and all corners of the world accessible to all citizens, we’ll be able to foster new knowledge and inspire new creativity.  The concepts of an “opened” and “shared” culture is not limited however digitalization of collections and share them online, it means also to bring the open data philosophy from the digital world to the real world, i.e. to promote and implement policies towards cultural heritage management that are more collaborative and open to citizens. For instance, more and more sites are open to public fruition even during regeneration works or excavations (minding always security and other restrictions), allowing an inter-action between the promoters and the “final clients” all along the process.  Active policies are then required to facilitate this change in cultural institutions, moving the sense of ownership from these institutions to the actual citizens which are in fact the ultimate “owners” of the city heritage.

IMPLEMENTING LOCAL APPROACHES TO YOUTH EMPLOYMENT AND OPPORTUNITY. 
1. GENERAL SITUATION.  
The International Labour Organisation describes youth employment (YU) as a global challenge and a top policy concern, decrying an international state of affairs wherein 156 million young workers live in poverty and there are 71 million unemployed young people.  In the EU-28, Eurostat calculates there were 4.219 million unemployed under 25 year olds as of December 2016, 2.957 million of whom in the euro area. This represents a year over year decrease of 196 000 in the EU-28 and of 88 000 in the euro area.  The EU had 6.6 million young people aged 15-24 in NEET situations in 2015 (i.e. greater than the population of Denmark). 
2. DYNAMICS AND TRENDS IN EUROPEAN YOUTH UNEMPLOYMENT.  
2.1. Down but still high. 
 In percentage terms, the December 2016 youth unemployment rate was 18.6 % in the EU-28 and 20.9 % in the Eurozone, down from 19.5 % and 21.8 % respectively in December 2015. This is even further down from the peak of 23.9 % (EU-28) and 24.6% (Eurozone) in the first quarter 2013. Conversely, the numbers are still significantly above the pre-crisis low of 15.1% (EU-28) and 15.2% (Eurozone) in the first quarter 2008. 
2.2. From place to place  
EU-level aggregate numbers don’t tell the whole story; youth unemployment rates vary enormously across the EU’s Member States (MS), and even across regions within the Member States, though there is a broad European trend whereby youth unemployment usually hovers at something near double the general unemployment rate. As of December 2016, Eurostat puts the lowest national YU rate at 6.5% for Germany, versus the top rates of countries like Greece at 44.2 % (October 2016), Spain at 42.9 %, and Italy at 40.1 %. For 2015, Eurostat finds a variation across the EU’s 276 NUTS-2 regions going from 2.5% for Freiburg, Germany to 79.2% for Ceuta, Spain. 
2.3. Which young people are most likely to be affected. 
 Unemployment is affected by wide range of factors involving gender, health, ethnicity, social-economic issues, and so forth. Moreover, these factors do not lead to the same outcome or even in the same direction, from country to country.  For instance, being male or female can make you both more and less likely to fall into a NEET (Not in Employment Education or Training) situation, depending where you are in Europe (see accompanying Eurofound graphic).  Note, while being unemployed and being in a NEET situation are not precisely the same thing, the two issues greatly overlap and this document will refer to data and trends in relation to both concepts. By definition a NEET situation young person is not employed, however a key distinction to be aware of is that unemployment numbers are calculated over the active population (of any age group), whereas NEET numbers are calculated over the total population of the age group in question.  Similarly, the correlation of level of education with NEET situations varies greatly; in some Member States those with low levels of education are the most likely to be in a NEET situation, in others they are the least. While there is great diversity across Europe, with regards to how youth unemployment is experienced, there are certain clusters linked by broadly similar trends.  Eurofound’s research (see accompanying graphic) identifies 3 such general clusters. The first is a mix of Nordic and West European countries: Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Slovenia, Sweden, the UK and, as southern outlier, Malta.  Main characteristics: Flexicurity policies. Dual educational system. Liberal economies. Quicker and smoother school-to-work transitions. Lower NEET rates. NEET situations mostly stemming from low education levels. Lower share of long-term unemployed and discouraged workers. Unemployment more short-term than EU average and job seekers less far from the labour market/less difficult to employ. Inconsistent patterns with regards to gender; where female rates are higher this seems often linked to family/care responsibilities.  Above EU average for unemployment due to health or disability. The second cluster is mostly southern or Mediterranean: Croatia, Cyprus, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Spain and, as northern outlier, Ireland.  Main characteristics: Hard hit by economic crisis. Lots of problems and delays in school-to-work transitions. Structural barriers to labour market access for young people. Above average NEET situation rates (except Portugal). More long-term unemployment and discouraged workers. Below EU averages for NEET situations due to illness, disability or family responsibilities. The highly educated at above average risk of NEET situation (except Spain and Portugal). Males found disproportionately in NEET situations.  The third cluster, more heterogeneous than the first two, is mostly Eastern: Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania and Slovakia  Main characteristics: Above EU average for NEET situations stemming from family responsibilities. Majority of females in NEET situations (except Estonia). Middle level of education most likely to lead to NEET situation. Inconsistent closeness to labour market, i.e. Czech Republic, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland above average for NEETs who less far from the labour market (‘re-entrants’/coming back into work and short-term unemployed). Conversely Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia have above average rates of long-term unemployed and discouraged workers.   
2.4. Europe-wide risk factors.  
While there is great variance in unemployment and NEET situations and causes across Europe, there are some major risk factors, which are consistently significant across Europe. Earlier Eurofound research (see accompanying graphic) identified a set of primary risk factors generally pertinent throughout Europe, these being: education, migration backgrounds, health disability, divorce and family issues, intergenerational transmission of unemployment (growing up in a workless household), low income/poverty, living in disadvantaged remote location. 
2.5. Consequences of youth unemployment.  
In personal terms, the damage caused to people by going through extended experiences of youth unemployment and NEET situations can be considerable.  Extensive research literature points to the negative impact of unemployment on those experiencing it, in terms of mental and physical health, social and family ties, and so forth.1 Unfortunately, the impact of an experience of unemployment can go well beyond the actual period of time of that experience – this is known as scarring in the general literature and hysteresis in economics.  1 McKee- Experiences of extended (6 months or more) youth unemployment are shown to correlate with poorer mental health outcomes throughout later life.2  Youth unemployment also makes reduced personal income, higher unemployment and generally poorer life chances more likely in later life3. It is also associated with a greater likelihood of later problems with health, socialising, the justice system and substance abuse4.  The longer unemployment goes on, particularly in a formative time of life, the farther from the labour market person becomes and thus increasingly damaged and difficult to reintegrate5.  
2.6. Damage for society as a whole.  
Hysteresis means the skills and qualifications of young people going through extended unemployment erode; they are not as employable at the end of the unemployment period as they were before it started. Skills, generic competences, morale and social connectivity are all harmed. All this in turn affects the economy’s potential output, by lowering it.6  The harm hysteresis causes to the supply side of the labour market (lower skills, less qualified workers) ultimately impacts employment dynamics, raising the so-called ‘natural employment rate’ or lowering the level of ‘full employment’ – i.e. what starts as a conjunctural situation morphs into a structural problem.7  There is no small debate among economists and researchers over how best to calculate the economic costs of large scale youth unemployment and large numbers of youths in NEET situations, however there is generalised agreement that there are such costs and that they are significant. Roughly, these costs divide up in terms of increased public expense – unemployment benefits payments and so forth — and lost public revenue – taxes not paid, reduced economic potential and productivity, etc. In 2012 Eurofound estimated total cost of NEET situation youth in the EU as a whole of €153 billion for the year of 2011, or more than 1.2% of EU GDP1. Similar estimations were produced on a per country basis – see accompanying chart.  Similarly, Eurofound calculated economic costs of NEET rates in relation to Member State GDP – see accompanying chart.  While European youth unemployment has gone down since 2011 (2011: EU 21.7% and 21.3% in the Eurozone versus 18.6 % in the EU-28 and 20.9 % in the Eurozone as of December 2016) and changed in nature (currently unemployment is becoming more long-term) complicating an extension of these numbers to the current situation, the broader point – that these costs are not economically insignificant – remains established.  Moving to longer-term considerations, unemployment, youth unemployment and declining economic productivity are issues of major concern for Europe’s ageing societies. Dependency ratios – the number of people working to support those who are not working (retired, disabled, children etc.) – are in decline and projected to decline considerably across the EU. The EU -28 ratio of persons aged 65 per 100 persons aged 15-64 was 28.8 for 2015, and is projected to grow to 39.0 by 2030, and 49.4 by 2050. This means less and less people working to support more and more who aren’t. Society, and the public purse, will need as many people of working age as possible to be in work, and ideally as economically productive as possible.  Large numbers of unemployed young people, NEET situations and workers with reduced productivity due to scarring/hysteresis are, quite specifically, the opposite of what is needed. Moreover, there are other considerations to do with the quality of democracy and social inclusion in European societies. Lengthy experiences of unemployment and NEET status correlate with less trust, less democratic participation and civic engagement. “NEETs aged 15–29 years have a considerably lower level of trust in comparison with their non-NEET counterparts in all the variables considered… The lowest levels of trust are felt towards politicians and political parties…  NEETs are substantially less engaged in politics than the rest of the young population. At EU level, almost 65% of NEETs declared a disposition to vote, compared to more than 75% for non-NEETs… The lowest rate was found among NEETs who were unemployed, at only 62.4%... the English-speaking countries recorded the lowest share of unemployed young people who would participate in elections, at 32.9%. A high proportion of young unemployed people said they would participate in elections in the Scandinavian and Mediterranean countries, at 93.8% and 74.4% respectively.  Approximately 40% of non-NEETs are interested in politics, compared to 28.7% among NEETs…  At European level, young non-NEETs have a much higher general social participation rate than that of NEETs: 46% against 26.7%... NEETs have a significantly lower likelihood of participating in any kind of organisation than the non-NEETs1” 
4. YOUTH EMPLOYMENT POLICIES AND ACTIONS. 
 Eurofound1 identifies 5 basic policy categories to support young people along a pathway to employment: Measures to prevent early school-leaving.  Best Practice example: Learning Communities, Spain. Pupils and school communities in disadvantaged areas. Works mainly through the development of alternative and innovative pedagogical approaches. Key feature: bottom-up approach, involving the whole community with setting targets, and designing and implementing a plan to foster educational success.  Measures to reintegrate early school-leavers. Best Practice example: Youthreach, Ireland. Early school-leavers aged 15–20 years, divided into 2 priority groups: unemployed young school-leavers aged 15–20 years with no or incomplete qualifications. 2nd target group: young people with more complex needs, e.g. lone parents, released from detention, or Travellers. Approach: very individualised education plans, career counselling, work placements and apprenticeships. Flexible curriculum. Emphasis on development of literacy and numeracy, personal development and health.  School-to-work transition policies. Best Practice example: Job guarantee for young people, Sweden. 48% of all young unemployed people in Sweden participated in the scheme in 2010. Policy aim is to minimise the time young people spend without a job, education or training, thus improving long-term chances on the job market, reducing ‘scarring’ and ‘wage penalties’. Focus is on job search activities, e.g. guidance and coaching, work internships, apprenticeships and work experience placements. Measures to foster employability. Best Practice example: Supra-company apprenticeships, Austria. For young people unable to find regular apprenticeship places and ‘older’ young people, who have been searching for an apprenticeship placement for over a year, low-skilled young people and young people facing particular social problems. The idea is to provide an alternative form of apprenticeships as a ‘safety net’ for young people unable to find apprenticeships in companies, thus overcoming the gap between supply and demand of apprenticeship places.  Measures to remove practical and logistical barriers to employment. Best Practice example: Chances Card, Finland. The practice helps young people find employment with the help of a work subsidy. Young people could take the card to employers and show that if they were hired, the employer would receive a government subsidy for up to 10 months.  The same Eurofound research outlines the strengths and weaknesses of a range of approaches under each of these policy categories.     
5. CONCLUSION.  
Young people coping with unemployment and NEET situations is a multifaceted issue and a range of quite varied actions can be equally legitimate policy responses.  In JobTown 2, the partners know what projects and actions they are trying to make happen, and are all wrestling with how to do it. JobTown 2 is a way for them to share and learn from each other and to acquire the very specific capacity building they need to better face the challenges of this juncture.  This will involve simultaneously struggling with a mix of ‘content’ issues – e.g. making support services for young entrepreneurs more effective, improving data available about local labour market skills demand, and so forth – and the more ‘process’ related Implementation Challenges – e.g. maintaining stakeholder involvement and commitment or refining indicators for monitoring implementation.  We believe the potential ‘market’ for learning from this network, on how to successfully implement strategies/actions/policies at the local level, in support of youth employment, is large.

IMPLEMENTATION CHALLENGES IN THE FIELD OF EARLY SCHOOL LEAVING.

1. Introduction. 
1.1. Stay Tuned and URBACT Implementation Networks. 
The transition from policy and strategy into delivery of tangible results remains a challenge for cities and governments. The creation of a new type of network to support cities in making this transition is a major step for URBACT. It signals a willingness to move into what is traditionally more difficult territory. 
To this end, the URBACT III Programme has introduced a new kind of transnational exchange network, to focus on implementation of strategy and local action plans within cities. The Stay Tuned network is one of seven new networks approved in autumn 2016 and this network will focus on the theme of reducing Early School Leaving (ESL). 
This report sets the context for this project, including a overview of the current position of ESL-reducing schemes, as well as covering the implementation challenges that are likely to be experienced by city partners. References in the text are listed at the end of the report.
Figure 1 
2. Early School Leaving. 
2.1. Context and Definition. 
Early School Leaving (ESL) is not a new problem. There have always been differences of opinion on the value of schooling and on the form that schooling should take. The breadth of educational options on offer to young people is now greater than ever before, incorporating a wide variety of opportunities to suit different learning styles and aspirations. This should ensure that a large majority of young people will successfully complete their schooling. 
However, there is still a significant number of youngsters starting their adult life with few or no formal qualifications or skills as a result of leaving school early. This has significant consequences for both the individual and society more generally, including an increased risk of unemployment, poverty and social exclusion, as well as the mental and physical health problems that that may cause. 
The definition of ‘early school leaving’ at an EU level refers to ‘those young people who left education and training with lower secondary education or less, and who are no longer in education and training’. This is measured as young people (18-24) who reach early adulthood without upper secondary qualifications and are no longer in education or training. Figure 1 shows the rates of ESL in nation states across the EU.
There are variations across EU member states in the practical meaning of ESL, but there is broad consensus that it is a shared challenge. In 2012 more than 2 out of every 5 early school leavers were unemployed; of whom it is reported that approximately 70% would like to work. However, as an increasing number of jobs lie within the knowledge economy, only around one in ten jobs will be accessible for them in the future. This rapid change in the nature of work and the gradual demise of the traditional “career-for-life” leaves many young people with an unclear view of the world of work and leads to a challenge in aligning educational achievement with choices for future employment. 
Further action in the area of Early School Leaving is clearly necessary if we are to ensure the future prosperity of European cities and their populations.
2.3. An Integrated View of ESL. 
The EU measure of ESL provides a solid reference point for measurement of those who have left school and reached early adulthood without upper secondary level qualifications. However, active measurement of the drop-out rates at different levels/ages is also important if we are to understand the exact nature ESL within a particular city context. This understanding is necessary if ESL is to be tackled effectively. 
The time for the full results of policies to be seen is often 5+ years in the case of monitoring at the EU-defined (young adult) level, particularly if the root causes are to be tackled earlier in school. For that reason, a more in-depth and more widely inclusive definition and set of measures needs to be used if it is to support effective implementation of integrated action plans.
In addition, any ESL-reducing project must recognise the importance of developing relevant knowledge, skills and abilities in young people, not solely on completion of a number of years in school (school participation being only a proxy indicator of the employability of an individual). There is also the related issue of making assumptions that completion of upper secondary or further level (formal) education is necessary or indeed appropriate for all young people or all career paths. Furthermore, with the economy in many countries shifting to a more entrepreneurial and SME-driven model, the role of traditional qualifications is coming more and more into question. For the purposes of this project, this cannot be tackled in the mainstream, however, it must be acknowledged as a relevant consideration if a truly holistic approach is to be taken. 
We should also be mindful of the need for ESL reduction to be fully integrated into the local development plans of the city or region. An increase in skills and qualifications across the board does not de facto result in instant, wholesale increases in employment prospects. Staying in school longer and gaining a higher level of qualifications and skills benefits the individual directly, increasing their confidence and employability. They are more employable than others around them. But on a systematic level, if the number of qualified young people in a city increases, an increased employment rate will only follow if there is a sufficient supply of jobs at an appropriate level in the right places. Geographical mobility is less typical amongst many groups who also have higher risks of ESL. 
The challenge for cities is thus to understand their desired results for any ESL-reduction project: is the result to simply increase the skills of its population or to also employ those skills within the local city economy? A city which wishes to retain the skills locally will, for example, need ensure that their local economy evolves to make best use of the increased skills base or risk young people leaving the area to find employment elsewhere or staying local but still unemployed or under-employed. 
In practical terms, the way cities define ESL in their context must consider the skills and abilities of young people in the workforce, not just solely the completion or otherwise of a number of years in school. The overall purpose of ESL reduction at a city level needs to be clearly understood in order to achieve the right results. Reducing ESL is itself not the end goal.
4. IMPLEMENTATION CHALLENGES. 
4.1. The URBACT Framework of Implementation Challenges. 
Implementation Networks within URBACT III have a standard framework for describing the Implementation Challenges encountered by cities that are working to implement strategy. For the purposes of Stay Tuned in that context, the four main challenge areas are: 
Ensuring an integrated approach in the delivery of the strategy and related actions/projects. 
Maintaining involvement of local stakeholders and organising decision-making for delivery. 
Setting up efficient indicators and monitoring systems to measure performance. 
Moving from strategy to operational action-plan. 

These are not discreet challenges. Managing each of them cannot be done in isolation. If the implementation is to be integrated so will be the nature of the implementation challenges. However, considering each challenge area in isolation does help to analyse the specific aspects and consider what activities are required to tackle that challenge. But the effects of any activity on other challenge areas must also be considered as part of delivery planning and management. 
The nature of these challenges will vary from city to city and each project partner will develop full definitions during the first phase of the project. The sections below provide an overview of the nature of the Implementation Challenges faced by cities and form a starting point for discussions within the network. 
The URBACT framework has three further Implementation Challenges, which are deemed less relevant for the field of ESL and the city partners in question. These are: 
Setting up Public Private partnerships for delivery. 
Designing smart public procurement frameworks. 
Enhancing funding of urban policies by exploring financial innovation. 

There are aspects of these challenges which may be considered by partners, but these will not be the main focus of any of the implementation projects within the Stay Tuned network: Procurement is a very tangential theme within the context of early school leaving with no direct impact on the solutions being implemented; Public-Private partnerships are limited to the stakeholder engagement and collaboration level (for example, schools working closely with local businesses when providing apprenticeships). 
Financial innovation may provide a funding mechanism for parts of some city solutions and will therefore not be discounted entirely by partners, but again, it will not be prominent feature within action plans, and would likely only feature in one or two, even if this approach was adopted by some partners during the course of the project.
4.2. Ensuring the integrated approach in the delivery of the strategy and related actions/projects. 
As previously discussed, ESL is a multi-faceted problem and delivery of most solutions is not the responsibility of one team or agency. Developing strategy in an integrated and collaborative way can be a challenge enough for many city authorities. Turning those theoretical plans into tangible actions and thus into sustained change can be even harder and is often an insurmountable barrier. Truly integrated implementation requires a truly integrated team behind it. This may sound obvious, but even very fundamental systems and process in the implementation of projects do not heed this point and struggle to deliver as a result. 
What’s in it For Me? 
In practice, this means that integrated delivery requires a shared and understood aims between all the partners involved as well as regular and effective communication. It also requires there to be mutual (or at least acceptable levels of) benefit for all the partners. People need a reason to support and deliver on a particular course of action. Careful analysis and understanding of all the stakeholders involved is critical, as is a coherent plan for engaging and or managing them to ensure appropriate support and decision-making. 
There is a potential challenge where action plans, whilst agreed in principle, have not been wholly created and/or wholly supported by all those involved in their delivery. Partner cities will need to ensure that the key stakeholders and delivery teams are engaged and that there is a shared understanding and ownership of the delivery plan. Delivery of activities in a collaborative and wholly integrated way often results in a longer delivery time - the work involved in getting agreement and approvals across a range of partners and creating/coordinating capacity at the right time across multiple delivery actors can take time. Project sponsors and the key players from the various departments/agencies involved in the delivery need to be kept engaged, informed and supported during the whole project. This can be a challenge during extended delivery timescales, where interest can wane and attention shift onto new things. 
4.3. Maintaining involvement of local stakeholders and organising decision-making for delivery. 
Successful stakeholder involvement is pivotal to success and closely linked to the above challenge regarding an integrated approach. From the outset, a clear stakeholder map, a proper understanding and a defined engagement and management plan for the stakeholders is critical to successful implementation. 
Get Off My Land…! 
In many cities, individual schools and educational institutions have a significant amount of autonomy in how they operate. This means that, in the case of the specific policy area of reducing ESL, cities have the additional complications of managing the implementation of a “single” action plan across a wide range of local partners, each with their own interests, territories and priorities. Consequently, the local decision-making around the implementation can be complex and time-consuming. Collaboration and exchange of practice at transnational level will therefore greatly enhance the ability to succeed in local implementations as best practice from across the partnership can be applied to all governance structures. 
In addition, some of the governance approaches required may present a greater degree of uncertainty or risk. This will represent a notable cultural shift in some cases. The participation in a network with eight other cities undergoing the similar activity provides both reassurance and support to each partner city, having the opportunity to draw on expertise from across the partnership as the implementation challenges are tackled. 
Room to Manoeuvre. 
Securing political mandate to act but avoiding political encroachment on the day-to-day delivery activity and (re)planning can be another difficult balance to achieve. A high degree of political acumen is needed. Where politicians approve work to achieve an outcome and provide ongoing support to delivering that outcome, implementation can be effective. Where there is encroachment into the day-to-day monitoring and management of actions then projects invariably cannot respond quickly and effectively to any issues encountered and can therefore slowly fail. 
Those putting projects into practice need the space and autonomy to be able to respond to unforeseen risks, barriers and issues arising during the lifetime of the project. On the flip-side, those delivering projects must maintain an effective and open dialogue with politicians and key stakeholders to ensure they are kept involved and that their information needs are met. The project teams and responsible persons must also know when they reach the limit of their decision mandate and be effective about seeking clarification or new decisions. A clear mandate with defined boundaries and scope is needed to allow freedom to act within the mandate, but which also provides a clear process for seeking revised decisions in the case of major unforeseen issues. 
4.4. Setting up efficient indicators and monitoring systems to measure performance. 
Measuring the effectiveness of solutions to ESL is also challenging, not least because the timescale to visible results is often 5+ years for any pre-emptive, early interventions. Effectiveness of encouraging actual early school leavers to return to education is easier to measure, as the initial effects (returning to education) are visible and measurable and occur with a much shorter timeframe. 
Where Did You Go…? 
Longer-term tracking of the outcomes for these returning students can still be patchy. In addition, whilst the headline drop-out rate is normally known, the reasons and nature of any (further) drop-out of returning students are still poorly understood in the majority of cases. This makes targeting of intervention efforts more difficult to calculate. As mentioned earlier, centralised and accessible databases of students is a common mechanism to address this problem, although quality is mixed and such systems and processes pose their own set of challenges. 
Following the Journey. 
Delivery and progress metrics also need to be defined and actively monitored. These in turn must be logically linked to the actions in the strategies and those to the expected results that should be achieved from those activities. The URBACT Results Framework provides a solid basis for this. Additional project and programme management methodologies will be required and progress towards the final goal must be measureable and followed closely. In terms of monitoring implementation and results, measures must consider and track the wide range of related factors which contribute to ESL in addition to the core educational activities and metrics.
Robust and effective programme and project management is essential if strategies are to be implemented effectively. Local governments are notoriously bad at this type of discipline. Experience shows that in many cases there is one of two extremes: either programme management either does not exist or is sloppy and does not track progress nor actively address risks and issues in a timely and appropriate manner, leading to project drift or scope creep; or alternatively, many local authorities who do implement programme and project management regimes do so in a an overly bureaucratic or even draconian way, which places a restrictive emphasis on process, documentation, and bureaucratic decision making structures, thus effectively strangling the project so insufficient progress is made. A careful balance is required. 
Implementing action plans effectively requires programme and project management approaches that are disciplined, efficient and yet flexible. This is especially the case when a degree of prototyping, testing or innovation is involved in the implementation. In these instances in particular, the decision making and management must be much more agile and responsive than traditionally used in government. 
4.5. Moving from strategy to operational action-plan. 
The ultimate aim for each city is to improve the delivery of its strategies, through effective and well-delivered programmes of activities and action. However, taking such action can often present risks and uncertainty. Cities face constant challenge when moving from discussion, theory and planning, into the arena of committing resources and starting to take actions which begin to impact upon people. 
The Will to Deliver. 
The governance and decision-making structures needed to support the delivery of such solutions can be difficult to establish, particularly if the solutions are new and innovative, breaking new ground or testing new approaches. Politicians can become hesitant when it comes to putting a set of unfamiliar activities into practice; senior managers can start to see the barriers as real and less manageable obstacles; front line staff begin to feel the challenge of having to work differently; citizens become uncomfortable at something different occurring in their neighbourhood. 
Thus, changes which deliver immediate benefits that are visible and widely understood are far more palatable and easily accepted by both politicians and citizens alike. Unfortunately, this works against the implementation of more significant changes that disrupt the status quo but which are often necessary if implementation of new policy is to be effected within a reasonable timeframe and with a decent result. 
The example from the Netherlands (“Anval op de Uitval”) highlights that ongoing reductions of ESL become progressively more challenging as ESL rates become lower – those cities with relatively high ESL rates have many opportunities and practice examples to draw upon; those with relatively low rates have to be more innovative and ambitious in their solutions in order to make even small reductions. Moving into the territory of tackling ESL amongst the most challenging and hard-to-engage cohorts often means long term systemic problems need to be resolved. 
Making it Stick. 
Another aspect is the transition from implementation project to ongoing business as usual. Many changes introduced by projects fail to become sustained in the longer term because this transition planning either never occurs or because key sponsors move onto the next priority without first securing the new practice as the norm. Systematic funding through normal mechanisms also needs to be in place to ensure successful approaches continue beyond and time-limited funding. A particular challenge for many of the cities is that the (necessarily) integrated nature of the solutions means the responsibility for funding may also be distributed. Securing funding for all aspects of a solution of this type can be a challenge when there are different opinions about who is responsible and hence who should pay! 
Coupled with that is the fact that city administrations are under increasing financial pressure. This presents two challenges. The first is simply that competing funding pressures can mean successful but yet unestablished practices get squeezed out. City administrations still tend towards favouring existing funding and structures when faced with tough choices - diverting funding from old / out-dated practice and onto new and emerging practices is still deemed too risky by many. This is particularly the case where a new practice takes place “up-stream” as a Prevention or Early Intervention activity designed to reduce or replace an existing Compensation activity. Cities are too often unwilling to divert enough funding to the new measure, resulting in it never becoming truly established. 
The second challenge is that financial pressures mean local government structure and models of delivery need to change significantly in the coming years in order to be financially sustainable. Conflicts and unintended consequences can arise when running an implementation work programme that is testing new approaches, whilst simultaneously making significant changes to local operating models during the lifetime of that work programme. The necessary changes to funding models and working structures can result in changes to one area undermining the ongoing sustainability of solutions in other areas. Another reason why integrated actions plans need to be delivered in a collaborative way. 
Collaborate to Innovate. 
However, moving to delivery of action plans in a collaborative and integrated way is still not yet standard practice in many cities. Many of the practices and behaviours needed to achieve this shift to collaborative and integrated working can be unfamiliar and challenging. Key methods such as open innovation and user-centred design are becoming much more common place within city administrations, as are the concepts of collaborative and social innovation. 
All of these have similar routes and basic values, which are echoed in the approaches to be taken within the Stay Tuned project. Rapid testing of solutions, agile and iterative processes and a focus on collaboration and user-engagement are all inherent in various partner action plans and the overall approach for the project embraces this type of thinking. However, in reality city administrations still struggle with these concepts in practice, even if they do commit to using them in principle. The reality of delivery often feels very different to taking decisions in principle and the required ways of working can conflict with fundamental norms and behaviours. 
In terms of achieving impact through the delivery of innovative actions, Gott (2014) highlights that “User involvement in design and refinement makes the innovation better and easier to embed in city environments”. He goes on to discuss how success in trialling and adopting new practices requires that “Leadership needs to be generated in communities not just in city authorities”. 
Whilst in many ways, this simply re-emphasises the implementation challenges listed here, it normally requires significant changes in behaviour and practice to achieve leadership out-with the city administration and to involve ‘external’ users in the refinement and implementation of solutions. Both these things require skills that until recent years, were not frequently found within city administration. Even now, truly effective examples are not yet widespread.
The collaborative and supportive nature of the Implementation Networks will, however, enable cities to draw on peers and mentors during their implementation projects, both strengthening their capabilities around implementation and improving their technical practices relating to ESL. 
As a result, the Stay Tuned project has the challenge of a limited amount of well documented examples on which to build, but also the opportunity of being able to significantly influence and improve the practical knowledge and evidence base in the field of reducing ESL.

"Three Perspectives for the BHC URBACT Thematic Network 
The new Health Strategy of the European Union, “Together for Health: A Strategic Approach for the EU 2008-2013” (adopted on the 23rd of October 2007) highlights, among its four main principles, the recognition of the links between health and economic prosperity and the integration of health in all policies. These principles stress the role of health in strengthening – or weakening – the development potentialities of each member State and region in Europe and call for a major effort in the co-ordination 10 Crowhurst-Lennard S.H. and Lennard H.L. (1987), “Liveable cities”, Gondolier Press, Southampton, NY. 11 of policies at any level, since there is a two-way bridge between the effects on health of every policy and the influence of the latter when the citizens well-being is considered. Health and health related issues can, thus, be considered to have a deep impact on the quality of life of the European citizens and this is especially true in cities, where social and environmental health determinants (such as those influencing lifestyle, the quality and quantity of available choices in terms of healthy choices, and health factors more directly linked to disease prevention, as in the case of nutrition, tobacco and alcohol) become key factors for urban policies, often without a direct legal competence of the city government in these issues. The Building Healthy Community (BHC) Thematic Network thus focuses in creating opportunities for cities to shape healthy policies for their citizens by: - sharing knowledge and competences among partner cities; - co-operating with the Regional Managing Authorities of the relevant EU Structural Funds (being the Network a Fast Track); - investing in a bottom-up approach that leaves the decision-making process in the hand of Local Support Groups, while providing the support, methodology and toolbox to design the Local Action Plans. To achieve its goals, BHC intends to concentrate its efforts in 3 themes, each with a specific role in the 30 months lifespan of the implementation of the project. The first theme focus on Indicators and Criteria for a Healthy Sustainable Urban Development. European cities are facing new waves of transformations due to demographic change, fluxes of internal and trans-national migration, economic restructuring and changes in the traditional Welfare State structure, to name some of the most important factors of change. Experiences in tackling these issues are witnessed throughout the EU, with similarities and differences in the processes of regeneration and development undertaken but still there is a lack of knowledge in two important and interrelated fields: i. the relationship among these transformations, health and quality of life in cities and the promotion of a sustainable approach to urban development; ii. the capacity to measure this relationship, in order to monitor, assess and evaluate changes and policies that address these changes. Health Impact Assessment (HIA) is a methodology already experimented in many EU cities and promoted by DG SANCO, and is considered as a major opportunity to integrate health into all policies. HIA can influence the decision-making process at any level, and especially the city level, by addressing all determinants of health, tackling inequities, and providing a new impetus for participation and empowerment. Some partner cities already have experience in the HIA methodology and will act as donors of knowledge and competence to all the other partners. In the same time, urban health and quality of life related indicators are also often used as an ex-ante and ex-post policy evaluation tools. These indicators, whether developed in the framework of a trans-national network or place-specific experiences and needs, can benefit from the HIA approach, since it can provide methodology and knowledge in the field of data gathering and interpretation, while, on the other hand, urban indicators that address health as related to quality of life and that aim to help to define sustainable healthy policies can provide a sound tool for improving life conditions for all citizens in EU cities. 12 In this framework it is of paramount importance the use of possible synergies with already existing projects and programmes that are facing the same problems and working on the same issue: this is, in specific, the case of the EURO URHIS (European System of Urban Health Indicators) project, developed under the EU Public Health Programme. The second theme regards a Healthy Sustainable Lifestyle. As stated in the “Leipzig Charter on Sustainable European Cities” (24th of May, 2007), «all dimensions of sustainable development should be taken into account at the same time and with the same weight. These include economic prosperity, social balance and a healthy environment. At the same time attention should be paid to cultural and health aspects» (p. 1). The holistic dimension highlighted by sustainable development in cities is reflected in the need for more sustainable lifestyles that can positively influence life conditions and promote a healthier way of living in urban areas. A positive model of sustainable lifestyle depends on health determinants, such as personal behaviour and lifestyles (including problems deriving from the abuse of tobacco, alcohol, drugs and substances, nutrition diseases, mental health, etc.), living and working conditions and access to health services, and general socio-economic, cultural and environmental conditions (taking into account, for instance, the demographic change and the ageing society or the pollution deriving from electromagnetic fields). It is a priority for European cities, then, to tackle major health determinants as it constitute a great potential for reducing the burden of disease and promoting the health of the general population. The third theme, regarding the Use of Structural Funds in developing ""Health Gains"", is a transversal one which affects all the others and will help to point each city Local Action Plan in one direction or another. This transversal theme focuses on capacity building on the use of Structural Funds in developing health gains in European cities. Health is one of the priorities identified in the “urban dimension” of cohesion policy. Several Member States have made use of Structural Funds in order to address health issues, so one of the aims of BHC is to have a focus on exchanging experience in this field. To this purpose the Fast Track label has proved to be of paramount importance to involve the relevant Managing Authorities.  
II. The Partner Cities 
The BHC Thematic Network started, in its Phase 1, with a five cities partnership and the idea to work around four main themes. The first five partners of the project were: Torino (Italy, lead partner), Amaroussion (Greece), Belfast (United Kingdom), Lidingö (Sweden) and Lodz (Poland). The themes that were defined in the Phase 1 of the project were: 1. Health Impact Assessment and the use of urban health indicators; 2. Policies and actions for a healthy and active ageing; 3. Use of Structural Funds in designing actions to develop “health gains”; 4. Healthy Places and Healthy Environment. The first theme regarded the application of the HIA methodology, “a combination of procedures, methods and tools by which a policy, programme, product, or service may be judged concerning its effects on the health of the population”. The theme also referred to other urban health indicators, developed in many cities/regions as tools to assess the quality of a programme or to define an ex-ante set of actions. These indicators sometimes are not explicitly defined but can be traced in a broader set of indicators used to evaluate the quality of life in cities/regions. The second theme referred to the given the current demographic situation in many European countries, in which ageing has become an important issue in the definition of development policies at the national, regional and local level. Active and healthy ageing is, in fact, being promoted at the EU level to improve the elderly expectations in terms of quality of life and lifestyle and in terms of providing good services to prevent illness or bad health conditions. The third theme referred to Structural Funds as a way to provide an exceptional tool to design strategies to implement health and quality of life conditions in cities and regions of Europe. The fourth theme, finally, regarded healthy places and healthy environment as crucial issues in cities that has to face problems of neglected areas, physical concentration of disease and inequalities and implementation of regeneration strategies that are highly time and funds demanding. An healthy environment is also determinant in defining the degree of quality of life in a city or in part of a city. A place could be, in fact, defined as “healthy” as long as it has actually an healthy environment and it is perceived as a safe, lively, clean, nice, active area. The definition of these themes allowed a first transnational exchange in which all the partners, started to adapt the BHC structure to the existing priorities, needs and challenges. This process included the five new members contacted during the development of Phase 1: Bacau (Romania), Baia Mare (Romania), Barnsley (United Kingdom), Lecce (Italy), Madrid (Spain). During this phase, also taking into account the suggestions coming from the active participation in the network activities of DG SANCO and DG REGIO and taking into account the Fast Track status that brought into the network also the associated Managing Authorities, the themes have been re-elaborated and developed to better mirror priorities, needs and challenges of the extended partnership (cities, MAs and DGs) and the definition of concrete Local Action Plans to be implemented since the Phase 2 of the life of the Thematic Network and after the end of the project itself. To this purpose the themes have been “clustered” and reorganised in order to define an effective project structure. The first theme, on HIA and urban health indicators, have been reshaped in a wider “Indicators and Criteria for a Healthy Sustainable Urban Development”, to allow partnership with already existing projects (see previous section), to allow a direct involvement of DG SANCO and to let those cities that have already a long experience in the fields to act as donors in an transnational exchange learning process. The themes regarding the ageing population and the healthy places and healthy environment have been reshaped to allow a wider reflection of the role of health determinants in city and regional policies and of the impact of these policies on health and quality of life. The urban dimension is essential, from the point of view of the place where all policies impact and have effects and the place where integration and synergies can be effective. To this purpose the new theme has been labelled as “Healthy Sustainable Lifestyles”, because a city in which attention is not paid to this issue is a place where deep inequalities are accepted. In the case of this theme, it is foreseen – taking into account the results of the Local Mapping exercise – that cities will “cluster” themselves around a more “health determinants” oriented cluster and a more “urban regeneration” oriented one. The third theme, “Use of Structural Funds in developing ‘Health Gains’”, is the same as in Phase 1, since it become clearer during the process that it is essential to try to use the SF with a double purpose: i. to have funds for Local Action Plans related to health and quality of life issues; ii. to establish a two-way-bridge between needs from the cities and general policies definition strategies so to let health and quality of life be considered as first class policies for the development of the EU. To this purpose, the theme will be considered as a transversal theme that will continue during the whole life of the project.  
III. Health and Quality of Life in EU Cities: A Synthesis
The importance of the urban dimension 
Given the general context provided by the WHO, the EU and other national and international agencies, specific attention should be paid to the urban level and to quality of life in the cities. This has also been highlighted in the Leipzig Charter, in which it is stated that: “all dimensions of sustainable development should be taken into account at the same time and with the same weight. These include economic prosperity, social balance and a healthy environment. At the same time attention should be paid to cultural and health aspects. […] Our cities possess unique cultural and architectural qualities, strong forces of social inclusion and exceptional possibilities for economic development. They are centres of knowledge and sources of growth and innovation. At the same time, however, they suffer from demographic problems, social inequality, social exclusion of specific population groups, a lack of affordable and suitable housing and environmental problems” (p. 1)16. The Charter also recommend to make greater use of integrated urban development policy approaches by: - creating and ensuring high-quality public spaces; - modernize infrastructure networks and improving energy efficiency; - proactive innovation and educational policies. In this framework specific attention has to be paid to deprived neighborhoods within the context of the city as a whole, especially by: - pursuing strategies for upgrading the physical environment; - strengthening the local economy and the local labour market policy; - proactive education and training policies for children and young people; - promotion of efficient and affordable urban transport. All these suggestions directly, or indirectly, refers to health and quality of life and, thus, need to be tackled. It is also clear, though, that these suggestions call for a greater effort than those that can be done by cities alone, thus stressing the importance of a coordinated action among the EU, the national, the regional and the local level in the field of health and health related policies. Conditions in cities, sometimes compounded by urban planning practices, can be in fact detrimental to health. Healthy urban planning focuses on the positive impact that urban planning can have on human health, well-being and quality of life, and reflects WHO's broad definition of health. The health and well-being of any population requires a holistic approach that includes the involvement of many agencies and gives ownership to the communities involved. The traditional notion of top-down delivery of health care is no longer acceptable to central governments, who are seeking greater value for money, or – from another point of view – who are continuously reducing the amount of budget for local authorities. In the same time, the increasing return to the principles of public health signifies that a purely medical approach to health cannot by itself resolve the many health problems in increasingly complex cities. Government health strategy documents increasingly recognize the importance of the views of the people receiving services in needs-based service delivery and espouse the involvement of individuals and communities as a key objective in the future delivery of health services. To give people an effective voice in the shaping of the health services there needs to be a move away from one-off consultation towards ongoing involvement of local people. Healthy urban planning, in the simplest terms, should mean planning that (a) is not unhealthy and (b) promotes health. Factors affecting urban planning and health include: - high priority of urban planning and health in the political agenda; - monitor pollution level (air, water, outside and inside air pollution, etc.) and maintaining pollution under control; - plan, design and build urban areas focusing on people’s health (green areas, housing, availability and accessibility of health and social services, etc.). Planners must fully recognize the importance of housing environments, but an appreciation of the social and ecological consequences for the whole community is fundamental. For example, the spacious single-family home on a large lot may meet the needs of a single family, but such a solution is not feasible on a global level. When considering healthy housing design, it is necessary to strike a balance between the needs of the individual, of the family and of the larger community. Learning from mistakes, made in previous efforts to provide quality housing, is another vital component of healthy planning. Urban renewal was intensely popular in the 1960s and 1970s in North America and Europe. Between 1964 and 1974, the London County Council built 384 high towers with the intention of providing quality housing and less oppressive conditions for the economically disadvantaged. This practice is also known as “slum clearance.” The results have been a failure: in fact, some communities were found to be stronger, more vibrant and more hopeful prior to their dislocation. Dwelling types have also been linked to feelings of loneliness and isolation, particularly among the elderly and women. Such feelings of isolation are at their extreme among those living in high rises that are social housing projects, for these people have no other choice but to live in a place that isolates residents from one another and from the outside world based on their socio-economic status. To save costs, the design of each dwelling unit has often been repetitive, not taking into account the specific needs of a diversity of individuals, families and social activities. Isolation is intensified by the fact that social housing projects often look very similar and are easily identifiable, thus heightening the social stigma along with the increased feelings of loneliness among residents. Forcing people to live where they do not want to be and where they have not been given the opportunity to contribute to the process is essentially a recipe for social chaos in several EU cities. “Public spaces become barren zones where gangs wage war.”17 If a community does not have adequate health services, schools, libraries, recreational facilities or access to food and parks, the community loses a major buffer against violence. Without these critical institutions, not only is a buffer missing, but there is no community infrastructure and thus minimal opportunity for community cohesion, resulting in intensified fragmentation. This places urban planners in a position of great importance. It stresses the need for creating neighbourhoods that foster pride, respect and friendliness and ensure accessibility of services. It provides evidence of the importance of “liveable urban spaces located at the heart of the city or neighbourhood … [That] exemplify the essence of the community”18. There are, of course, many different opinions as to what constitutes a healthy city, depending upon one’s discipline, values and point of view. Nevertheless, general principles, theories and common parameters can be applied in working towards healthy urban planning. An healthy city should then focus on: - equity. All people must have the right and the opportunity to realize their full potential in health; - health promotion. A city health plan should aim to promote health by using the principles outlined in the “Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion” (17-21 Nov. 1986): build healthy public policy; create supportive environments; strengthen community action and develop personal skills; reorient health services; - intersectoral action. Health is created in the setting of everyday life and is influenced by the actions and decisions of most sectors of a community; - community participation. Informed, motivated and actively participating communities are key elements for setting priorities and making and implementing decisions; - supportive environments. A city health plan should address the creation of supportive physical and social environments. This includes issues of ecology and sustainability as well as social networks, transportation, housing and other environmental concerns. The tools and techniques used to initiate an alternative, healthy urban planning process will undoubtedly vary from city to city, neighbourhood to neighbourhood and group to group. Whatever the overall process, it must take into account the various cultures, religions and lifestyles in the community. Healthy urban planning does not view multiculturalism and diversity as problems to be overcome but rather as rich opportunities waiting to be seized. Urban planning must be sustained by dynamic leadership styles and open to various configurations. For example, it should be open to collaborative and bottom-up actions. Healthy urban planning thus makes room for citizens as leaders and requires catalytic leadership from planners. Disadvantaged and marginalized groups are particularly at risk in urban areas. In order to ensure health for all, the standards of health must consider the most vulnerable populations. This approach is often used in the setting of environmental health standards. For example, the standard for the maximum allowable levels of lead exposure is set for the most susceptible population, in this case children. This concept relates to urban planners: “To create a liveable city for all the community, one must design for its weakest members, children, disabled and the elderly. A city that is hospitable to these groups will foster a sense of well-being among all its citizens.”19 Health and health related issues can, thus, be considered to have a deep impact on the quality of life of the European citizens and this is especially true in cities, where social and environmental health determinants (such as those influencing lifestyle, the quality and quantity of available choices in terms of healthy choices, and health factors more directly linked to disease prevention, as in the case of nutrition, tobacco and alcohol) become key factors for urban policies, often without a direct legal competence of the city government in these issues. The Building Healthy Community (BHC) Thematic Network thus focuses in creating opportunities for cities to shape healthy policies for their citizens by: - sharing knowledge and competences among partner cities; - co-operating with the Regional Managing Authorities of the relevant EU Structural Funds (being the Network a Fast Track); - investing in a bottom-up approach that leaves the decision-making process in the hand of Local Support Groups, while providing the support, methodology and toolbox to design the Local Action Plans. The BHC Thematic Network started, in its Phase 1, with a five cities partnership and the idea to work around four main themes. The first five partners of the project were: Torino (Italy, lead partner), Amaroussion (Greece), Belfast (United Kingdom), Lidingö (Sweden) and Lodz (Poland). The themes that were defined in the Phase 1 of the project were: 1. Health Impact Assessment and the use of urban health indicators; 2. Policies and actions for a healthy and active ageing; 3. Use of Structural Funds in designing actions to develop “health gains”; 4. Healthy Places and Healthy Environment. The first theme regarded the application of the HIA methodology, “a combination of procedures, methods and tools by which a policy, programme, product, or service may be judged concerning its effects on the health of the population”. The theme also referred to other urban health indicators, developed in many cities/regions as tools to assess the quality of a programme or to define an ex-ante set of actions. These indicators sometimes are not explicitly defined but can be traced in a broader set of indicators used to evaluate the quality of life in cities/regions. The second theme referred to the given the current demographic situation in many European countries, in which ageing has become an important issue in the definition of development policies at the national, regional and local level. Active and healthy ageing is, in fact, being promoted at the EU level to improve the elderly expectations in terms of quality of life and lifestyle and in terms of providing good services to prevent illness or bad health conditions. The third theme referred to Structural Funds as a way to provide an exceptional tool to design strategies to implement health and quality of life conditions in cities and regions of Europe. The fourth theme, finally, regarded healthy places and healthy environment as crucial issues in cities that has to face problems of neglected areas, physical concentration of disease and inequalities and implementation of regeneration strategies that are highly time and funds demanding. An healthy environment is also determinant in defining the degree of quality of life in a city or in part of a city. A place could be, in fact, defined as “healthy” as long as it has actually an healthy environment and it is perceived as a safe, lively, clean, nice, active area. The definition of these themes allowed a first transnational exchange in which all the partners, started to adapt the BHC structure to the existing priorities, needs and challenges. This process included the five new members contacted during the development of Phase 1: Bacau (Romania), Baia Mare (Romania), Barnsley (United Kingdom), Lecce (Italy), Madrid (Spain). During this phase, also taking into account the suggestions coming from the active participation in the network activities of DG SANCO and DG REGIO and taking into account the Fast Track status that brought into the network also the associated Managing Authorities, the themes have been re-elaborated and developed to better mirror priorities, needs and challenges of the extended partnership (cities, MAs and DGs) and the definition of concrete Local Action Plans to be implemented since the Phase 2 of the life of the Thematic Network and after the end of the project itself. To this purpose the themes have been “clustered” and reorganised in order to define an effective project structure. The first theme, on HIA and urban health indicators, have been reshaped in a wider “Indicators and Criteria for a Healthy Sustainable Urban Development”, to allow partnership with already existing projects (see previous section), to allow a direct involvement of DG SANCO and to let those cities that have already a long experience in the fields to act as donors in an transnational exchange learning process. The themes regarding the ageing population and the healthy places and healthy environment have been reshaped to allow a wider reflection of the role of health determinants in city and regional policies and of the impact of these policies on health and quality of life. The urban dimension is essential, from the point of view of the place where all policies impact and have effects and the place where integration and synergies can be effective. To this purpose the new theme has been labelled as “Healthy Sustainable Lifestyles”, because a city in which attention is not paid to this issue is a place where deep inequalities are accepted. In the case of this theme, it is foreseen – taking into account the results of the Local Mapping exercise – that cities will “cluster” themselves around a more “health determinants” oriented cluster and a more “urban regeneration” oriented one. The third theme, “Use of Structural Funds in developing ‘Health Gains’”, is the same as in Phase 1, since it become clearer during the process that it is essential to try to use the SF with a double purpose: i. to have funds for Local Action Plans related to health and quality of life issues; ii. to establish a two-way-bridge between needs from the cities and general policies definition strategies so to let health and quality of life be considered as first class policies for the development of the EU. To this purpose, the theme will be considered as a transversal theme that will continue during the whole life of the project. The Local Mappings prepared for the exchanges during the Phase 1 represented a great effort for all the cities, and sometimes the already associated MAs, to share a methodology and a greater opportunity to discuss among partners of health and quality of life related issues. In the LMs it is also possible to see how health and quality of life are differently considered in the different national context and in a broader division of North-Atlantic countries, Southern Europe and Easter Europe. Yet, it is clear that when it comes to priorities, needs and challenges the most important issue regards the citizens well-being and the definition of healthy and sustainable policies. In this case, the ten European partners showed a real shared view and a common interest. The results of this interaction are in the redefinition of the themes of the Thematic Network and in the already started process of discussion and debate at local level, thanks to the established Local Support Groups. The redefined themes of which BHC intends to concentrate its efforts, each with a specific role in the 30 months lifespan of the implementation of the project, are as follows. The first theme focus on Indicators and Criteria for a Healthy Sustainable Urban Development. European cities are facing new waves of transformations due to demographic change, fluxes of internal and trans-national migration, economic restructuring and changes in the traditional Welfare State structure, to name some of the most important factors of change. Experiences in tackling these issues are witnessed throughout the EU, with similarities and differences in the processes of regeneration and development undertaken but still there is a lack of knowledge in two important and interrelated fields: iii. the relationship among these transformations, health and quality of life in cities and the promotion of a sustainable approach to urban development; iv. the capacity to measure this relationship, in order to monitor, assess and evaluate changes and policies that address these changes. Health Impact Assessment (HIA) is a methodology already experimented in many EU cities and promoted by DG SANCO, and is considered as a major opportunity to integrate health into all policies. HIA can influence the decision-making process at any level, and especially the city level, by addressing all determinants of health, tackling inequities, and providing a new impetus for participation and empowerment. Some partner cities already have experience in the HIA methodology and will act as donors of knowledge and competence to all the other partners. In the same time, urban health and quality of life related indicators are also often used as an ex-ante and ex-post policy evaluation tools. These indicators, whether developed in the framework of a trans-national network or place-specific experiences and needs, can benefit from the HIA approach, since it can provide methodology and knowledge in the field of data gathering and interpretation, while, on the other hand, urban indicators that address health as related to quality of life and that aim to help to define sustainable healthy policies can provide a sound tool for improving life conditions for all citizens in EU cities. In this framework it is of paramount importance the use of possible synergies with already existing projects and programmes that are facing the same problems and working on the same issue: this is, in specific, the case of the EURO URHIS (European System of Urban Health Indicators) project, developed under the EU Public Health Programme. The second theme regards a Healthy Sustainable Lifestyle. As stated in the “Leipzig Charter on Sustainable European Cities” (24th of May, 2007), «all dimensions of sustainable development should be taken into account at the same time and with the same weight. These include economic prosperity, social balance and a healthy environment. At the same time attention should be paid to cultural and health aspects» (p. 1). The holistic dimension highlighted by sustainable development in cities is reflected in the need for more sustainable lifestyles that can positively influence life conditions and promote a healthier way of living in urban areas. A positive model of sustainable lifestyle depends on health determinants, such as personal behaviour and lifestyles (including problems deriving from the abuse of tobacco, alcohol, drugs and substances, nutrition diseases, mental health, etc.), living and working conditions and access to health services, and general socio-economic, cultural and environmental conditions (taking into account, for instance, the demographic change and the ageing society or the pollution deriving from electromagnetic fields). It is a priority for European cities, then, to tackle major health determinants as it constitute a great potential for reducing the burden of disease and promoting the health of the general population. The third theme, regarding the Use of Structural Funds in developing ""Health Gains"", is a transversal one which affects all the others and will help to point each city Local Action Plan in one direction or another. This transversal theme focuses on capacity building on the use of Structural Funds in developing health gains in European cities. Health is one of the priorities identified in the “urban dimension” of cohesion policy. Several Member States have made use of Structural Funds in order to address health issues, so one of the aims of BHC is to have a focus on exchanging experience in this field. To this purpose the Fast Track label has proved to be of paramount importance to involve the relevant Managing Authorities.

"1/ Foreword 
The housing sector is one of the priority areas in Europe with regard to energy efficiency – not only because it consumes a great amount of energy (up to 50 per cent of total final consumption in some of the recent years), but also because it remains remarkably wasteful. While existing technologies provide a high potential to a drastically reduced energy use in housing, the sector actually maintains outdated, with inefficient practices. Much more energy is used than necessary; the contribution of housing to carbon dioxide emissions is high and growing; many residents do not have affordable or “clean” energy available; the penetration of efficiency technology in housing is low and much of the related business potential is untapped. The CASH project wants to address these challenges and thereby contribute to resolving today’s global problems of climate change, energy security, economic uncertainty, and poverty, by addressing energy efficiency in social housing. Initiatives to address the problems of energy efficiency are not new. They have been developed for decades if not centuries, especially intensifying as the oil crisis of the 1970s hit the capitalist economies hard. What has changed more recently is the growing sense of emergency and the globalization of the problem and its perception. Issues such as climate change, energy security, economic uncertainty, and poverty have all come to their summits and all achieved global status, demanding immediate, adequate and comprehensive responses. Housing offers a major possibility for action. Dwellings belong to the longest lived parts of a cities infrastructure. But energy efficiency in housing is more than a technical problem. The sort, quality and the variety of dwellings define for a great part the identity of a city or neighbourhood. Citizens identify themselves, or are being identified with their housing situation. Quality of housing, and its surrounding, has its influence on quality of life of the inhabitants, but also on the costs of living. This makes the matter more complicated for subsidized housing, where the costs for the individual tenant should be affordable, with acceptable costs for the house owner. So despite the technical high potential in energy savings, other aspects make the matter more complicated than it looks at the first sight. In the following chapters a brief description of the challenges that the CASH cities are confronted with is given.  
Part III Issues for CASH Project Implementation 
 Energy efficiency in social housing is a multifaceted subject. There are naturally financial and technical aspects, but also legal, cultural and organizational aspects involved. One of the concrete goals of the CASH project is to produce a manual for European cities and towns about energy efficiency in social housing, and many aspects or themes will have to have a place in that. The partners in the network have different experiences and starting positions with the themes. In one city financial tools can be well developed, while in another city this can be still unexplored area. In the CASH project experiences will be exchanged so at the end of the project all cities will be on the same knowledge level and also the themes will be further developed. During the implementation phase of CASH, a number of thematic meetings will be organized. Each meeting will explore and exchange on one theme, using the experiences of the cities, inspired by guest speakers and with additional studies. The results of each meeting will be the basis for a part of the final manual. In this chapter, the challenges and situation of the different cities in the CASH network are being described. During the first phase of CASH and in the city visits the different themes have been identified, based on the challenges the cities are confronted with on one side, and on the other side on good practices and experiences of the partner cities.  
Network 
The CASH Network consists of 10 cities, spread over the whole of Europe. From the most west city Bridgend, to the most east Yambol it is almost 2500 km. From Sønderborg, the most north town to Brindisi in the south of Italy it is almost 1700 km. The biggest city is Frankfurt, the smallest towns are Les Mureaux and Echirolles. The average age of the population is 38. The youngest population has Ptolemaida and Les Mureaux. Frankfurt and Brindisi may have the oldest average age, but cities like Bridgend and Sønderborg are confronted with a growing older population. Utrecht has on the other hand a wide variety of ages, with many students, an older traditional population and an expected growth of young families. The demographic changes in population have a strong influence on the housing policies of the cities. 
Social housing approach 
Social housing, subsidized housing, protected rent, etc. These are all different terms for the same issue. Cities have the responsibility to offer acceptable housing for that part of the population that cannot afford housing on the free market. The chosen approach of social housing is essential of how a city looks like and the quality of life in a city. The French system, steered by national legislation has led to strongly segregated social housing districts; the system change in CEE countries has lead to a setback in maintenance and bad building quality, etc. More was discussed in the first part of the baseline study. The CASH partners are all aware that they should and can make a difference now. Some cities, like Echirolles and Les Mureaux choose for big renovation and renewal investments, in combination with city planning, to improve the quality of life in the city; Frankfurt spreads actively the social houses over the city. Before discussing about energy efficiency, the partners will exchange knowledge and experiences on the social housing system they are using. Advantages and opportunities of each system will be discussed. 
Owner / occupants – splitted property 
All cities in the CASH Network have together more than 1.5 million inhabitants. An estimated 60% of all these people live in rented apartments and houses. Most cities in the network have only a small part of the rented and social houses in own property. Although in some cities there is much rent, in other cities the individual occupants of the apartments are also the individual owners (up to 95% in Tatabánya and Yambol). Insulation and renovation in buildings can only be done cost efficiently if all owners participate. And with different owners in one building, this will not be easy. Each city has its own approach for this problem. Tatabánya has organizations like “Authorized Joint Representatives” which can be used as intermediaries, in other cities a minority can be legally forced to participate with the majority; and again in other cities the financial subsidy will be higher if all owners participate, etc. Citizens participation. 
Energy efficiency in housing can be seen as a technical subject. Insulation, new installations, new lighting systems, etc. can be approached from a technical and financial point of view. One essential aspect of CASH is the fact that the main target is existing buildings; houses where people live with their families. All actions within the CASH project directly affect the housing and living situation of individual families. It is essential to involve the citizens. In most Local Support Groups already representatives of tenants are involved. Next to that the cities involve the habitants of the houses. Brindisi has a constant dialogue with the citizens in the Paradiso district, just like Utrecht in the West district; Frankfurt has individual meetings with each family that is involved in a renovation project, etc. There is often a conflict between the general interest for CO2 reduction, the house owner’s interest for investment in the quality of the building, and the individual interest of the occupant, which is often also connected with emotions. The cities will discuss the tensions that can occur and the way this is handled in each city. 
CO2 neutral or better realistic
 Target setting is important. Only then the City can motivate other stakeholders to participate, can effective the progress towards the targets. Sønderborg has set a very ambitious goal, to be carbon neutral in 2029. The same goal has Utrecht for 2050. Echirolles seems on paper only a little less ambitious, it wants to reduce the green house gas emissions with a factor 4 by 2050. Other cities in the network set lower, maybe easier to reach or more realistic goals. What are the advantages of each approach? How does monitoring fit in each approach? Is it politically acceptable not to monitor if the goals are set too high? Etc. 
Feed-in tariff 
A feed-in tariff is a policy mechanism designed to encourage the adoption of renewable energy sources. It typically includes three key provisions: • guaranteed grid access, • long-term contracts for the electricity produced, • purchase prices that are methodologically based on the cost of renewable energy generation. Under a feed-in tariff, an obligation is imposed on regional or national electric grid utilities to buy renewable electricity, from all eligible participants. The costbased prices therefore enable a diversity of projects (wind, solar, etc.) to be developed, and for investors to obtain a reasonable return on renewable energy investments. FITs typically offer a guaranteed purchase for electricity generated from renewable energy sources within long-term (15–25 year) contracts. These contracts are typically offered in a non-discriminatory way to all interested producers of renewable electricity. See table page 78. In all the countries of the CASH Network a feed in tariff is, or will soon be, legally installed. Some cities, like Frankfurt and Brindisi, are reacting on this by installing solar collectors on the roofs of their social houses. In most cities there is no systematic approach how to make use of feed in tariffs. 
District heating or individual heating 
In most of the partner cities district heating is wide spread (with Ptolemaida and Tatabánya at the top). Both Bridgend and Yambol, have for different reasons no district heating. Les Mureaux and Sønderborg are both in a transition towards renewable energy sources for their heat network, Les Mureaux with wood, Sønderborg with solar and geothermal heat. Ptolemaida chooses for district heating because it has a cheap and secure supply, Tatabánya because it now owns the heat producing company. Other cities, like Yambol and Bridgend choose individual heating because of the freedom or the less dense city structure. Utrecht is looking for creative solutions for co-ownership of the heat infrastructure. It should be made clear what possible options are for energy efficiency in housing on the long term and how that can be organized? 
Combined Heat Power production plants 
Power plants that are remote from the end users of the energy they supply are relatively energy inefficient, with over 60 per cent of the energy from fossil fuels being lost before the electricity reaches our buildings through transmission and waste heat. A local decentralised community energy system can help tackle these issues. This is combined heat and power (CHP) serving district heating. Systems can be block based or site wide, and supplying both heat and electricity. Frankfurt is principally using CHP and now also actively promoting small scale combined heat power plants for smaller districts or housing blocks. 
Renewal versus renovation 
For some houses it is economically not viable anymore to renovate, either because the building quality is too low, or because the size of the apartments are not adapted to modern families anymore. Renewal (demolish with newly built) is financially a then better solution than renovation. Les Mureaux and Echirolles are using it also for diversify the housing stock. Monotone housing areas are adapted to new household sizes and price structure. Frankfurt’s renovations are oft so intense that also the habitants have to move and new people move into the district. Not always clear are the social effects? Are there other environmental aspects involved? 
Costs of energy related to local economy 
In most cities the energy for housing is being supplied by national or international energy production companies. From an local economical point of view, this means that if the citizens pay their energy bill, this money leaves the local economy. If the cities, or citizens, produce their own energy, then the money paid for that stays in the local economy. Some cities keep for that reason too, the energy distribution or energy production in their own hands. Tatabánya has got a majority in the energy production plant and hopes with the payments for energy, to improve the district heating net. Sønderborg has calculated that heating effort creates new green jobs. There will be a massive need for craftsmen and consulting when 3,400 households in urban areas will be connected to the district heating network and 6,200 rural households will switch to heat pumps and fossil-free heating before 2015. Can this be a feasible policy for other cities too? 
Adapting rents to energy situation 
Saved energy is also saved money. Energy efficient should lead to lower fixed costs for housing. Every Euro not spent on energy can be spent on other things. Energy efficiency may not only improve the financial situation of the households, but also improve the local economy, because more money is spent locally. This coin has two sides. Improving energy situation needs investments. Saved energy costs can be used to pay these investments, because insulation leads also to a better house quality. To stimulate house owners to invest in energy efficiency, it could be good that the investments can be earned back with a higher rent. Frankfurt is studying the possibility to adapt rents to the energy quality of the houses. For tenants this can be a disadvantage. The living quality will rise, but the total rent inclusive energy costs might end up higher than before. In social housing with protected or subsidies rent, this may even get more complicated. Cities will have to find a balance in this matter. 
Energy contracting 
Energy Contracting means that a private company carries out energy-saving measures at its own expense. Payment is made within a guaranteed amortization period, using a part of the actually saved energy costs. In some cities the concept is used, e.g. in Frankfurt, but not in a very structured way. In Tatabánya a company has offered to install new elevator engines on its own risk; in Yambol the gas company is using the concept for a kindergarten building. Making use of energy contracting will not only reduce the pressure on the municipal budget, but can also stimulate the development of local energy service companies. In Brindisi already many small solar and other energy companies have started their activities. Sønderborg is deliberately involving local enterprises in its ZeroCarbon plan. Technical issues (insulation material, techniques) 
Energy efficient renovation is a strong developing business concept. Nowadays it is already possible to renovate and insulate up to passive-house level. While on one side Frankfurt is developing insulation material which is only 20mm thick but with high insulation value, while Utrecht is insulating historical monuments without changing the appearance, and while Ptolemaida is installing electronic, wireless heat meters, at the same time Bridgend is struggling with non-cavity walls, and in Brindisi houses are being renovated without insulation, because the knowledge about techniques and costs of insulation, are not available. Not only can cities in the CASH network exchange knowledge on new techniques and costs. But also cities can further stimulate the energy efficiency knowledge and skills in local companies. 
Subsidies of income versus subsidy of houses 
Many social programmes in cities give “low income households” an energy support in winter period. Also the energy can be delivered for a lower price than the market price. In such way energy poverty is combated. But low energy prices do not stimulate energy savings. Better would be to subsidy investments in structural energy improvements. This is less direct support and is not direct beneficial for households in need. (This theme is related to the adaptation of rent issue). 
Local regulation versus national regulation 
The CASH Network cities are progressive. Leadership on the energy issue in housing has been recognized in all cities. They all have the wish and the courage to do more than the average. Cities use for that many tools, from subsidies to campaigns, from own investments to facilitating new developments, etc. On legislative issues cities are often depending on national legislation and regulation. Cities have no own legislative power. But for reaching their ambitious goals, strong legislation and stricter norms are often needed. In the CASH Network cities can learn how to make local regulation stronger than national regulation. Secondly methods for lobbying for higher norms can be discussed and developed. 
Conclusion 
The first phase of the CASH project has delivered overview of the varieties and the similarities of the cities in the CASH Network. The many interviews and study visits have lead to an overview of questions and themes that will be discussed during the CASH project implementation phase. For some cities it is an eye opener to see that the problem they are confronted with is also seen as a problem by others. On the other hand it may be no problem issue at all in other cities of the network. Solutions may have been found, that can be adapted to the own situation, or at least inspire to creative thinking. Together the cities have already started to discuss what themes will have priority in the implementation phase, and for what a specific thematic meeting will be organized. Other themes might be discussed during the many meetings of the partners, and new subjects will rise during the project period for certain. The wide variety of the CASH cities guarantees inspiring discussions, the fact that all cities are motivated and have already started to improve the energy situation in the houses, promises that these discussions will be fruitful.
