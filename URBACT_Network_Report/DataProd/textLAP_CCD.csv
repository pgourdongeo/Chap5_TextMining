SAN DONÀ DI PIAVE 
 INTEGRATED ACTION PLAN 
 


 
 
 
  
1. San Donà di Piave: City Centre Context and Place Analysis 
 
San Donà di Piave is a city in the province of Venezia, Veneto, in the Nort-East of Italy. Despite being one of the historical centers in the area, the city was heavily damaged during the first world war and was completely reconstructed. The city’s geographical location and the transformations due to the war have had important repercussions on the development of the city itself and on the vocation (potential and current) of its centre.  
On the one hand, the city insists on very important and attractive touristic locations such as Venice and sea side cities and towns attracting millions of visitors every year, such as Jesolo, Caorle and the neighboring beaches of the Friuli Venezia Giulia Region. Such a positioning makes it a potential hub for services to the touristic destinations surrounding it. Nonetheless such an evolution is still contended and not completely mature.

On the other hand, the reconstruction of the city in the 20th century made it quite dissimilar from neighboring cities whose historical center was preserved, modifying profoundly both the appearance of the center and its functions.  
Recent developments of the economic and social fabric of the territory posed further challenges to the structure and vocation of the city center. Major retail players opened large commercial structures in the outskirts of the city and in neighboring towns. These structures posed relevant challenges to the identity of the city center, that went through two main transformations: in the 90s the city center became home for a variety of tertiary activities–banking and financial 
activities in particular–that triggered the growth of the service sector and the burgeoning of the construction industry. In the last 10 years–corresponding to the unfolding of the global financial crisis– these transformations were reversed and the center still struggles to develop a clear identity given the difficulties encountered by financial institutions and the difficulties in feeding a new generation of retail firms.  
Despite such difficulties, San Donà di Piave and its center still represent a location which is perceived as desirable for a number of new citizens attracted by its infrastructures, the comfortable logistics and the strategic positioning, as well as for the quality of life it offers. San Donà is in fact a crucial point of the transport infrastructures between Vento and Friuli Venezia-Giulia, it is located at the crossroad between the industrial development zone in the area of Treviso and the tourist attractions of Cavallino-Treporti, Jesolo, Eraclea and Caorle. 
URBACT City Centre Doctor was crucial in making sense of these transformations and trends. Urbact method of analysis and framing of potential developments for city centres, in fact, allowed to coalesce a variety of stakeholders to frame an identity of the city centre that might trigger a repopulation of the centre and a redefinition of its functions. This document illustrates the point of departure (place analysis), the steps undertaken, the measures and initiatives adopted and their potential developments, together with an analysis of the critical issues related to the governance of local stakeholders and interests. 
 
1.1  The city at a glance 
 
San Donà di Piave is located 35 km from Mestre; 40 km from Venice; and 40 km from Treviso. Its population was 41883 inhabitants at the beginning of 2017. The city is part of an integrated regional economy of the recently formed Venice Metropolitan City. Approximately a quarter of the city’s population commute out of the city daily for work or study purposes.  
The city is very well positioned in the metropolitan economy, even though its vocation has witnessed radical transformations in the last few years. In particular the opening of large, attractive commercial hubs in the outskirts of the city and in neighboring towns questioned the identity of the city centre as a lively hub for retail and service activities. The global financial crisis was felt by the city in the form of a dramatic shrinking of the construction sector that was burgeoning until 2006. Despite the hardships brought about by the global economic and financial crisis, the city showed a certain resilience and its economy exhibits encouraging signs of dynamism. Recent figures from the chamber of commerce (2018) show that new firms are being created and that the hemorrhage of extant ones, together with the associated jobs, has stopped. In 2017 the number of local companies grew for the first time, after seven years of negative performances (-2.3% since 2009). The birth of new firms–+0,8% in the last year– brought the total number of stablished companies in the area to 4415 units. The vast majority of them are not commercial branches of firms located elsewhere: 80% of these productive activities are rooted in the territory and have their headquarters in the city or in neighboring areas.  
Even though still weak as measures of newly found dynamism, these figures suggest that we are observing not just a turn in the economic cycle, but a larger redefinition of the economic and social fabric of the city. New firms in sectors and segments that were not a strength of the city show tangible signs of such transformation: activities related to tourism and or to the restaurant and hospitality business are growing (+23%), while the number of touristic presences in the city 
has a surpassed the number of inhabitants for the first time last year. Overnight stays in the city more than doubled since 2009 and grew 20% in the year 2017, arriving at 65 thousand. Traditional specializations of the city witnessed the signs of a major–and sometimes hard–restructuring: firms in the agricultural and construction industries diminished, respectively, of 24 and 16% since the beginning of the crisis.  
As far as jobs are concerned, one of the main critical issues of the city has been the attractiveness of close cities such as Venice and Treviso, determining the existence of a strong share of commuters in the local population. Commuting represents a critical factor for the rethinking of the city centre, given the absence of a large portion of active population during the days of the week. Despite these structural problems, job creation came back to positive figures starting from 2014. In 2016 the number of new jobs outgrew lay-offs (870 units). 
Logistically, the city is particularly fortunate: it is well connected to major centres in the region by an efficient rail and road public transportation systems. Two international airports (Venezia and Treviso) are located no more than 30 minutes from the city centre. Culturally, socially and from the point of view of safety, the city is particularly well-equipped. Nonetheless, it does not have the allure of nearby Treviso or Padua, given the relatively unattractive architectural heritage deriving from the 20th century reconstruction.   
 
1.2  Place Analysis 
According to URBACT’s methodological and operational directions, the ULG (Urbact Local Group) embarked in a place analysis aimed at understanding the main challenges the city centre faces and will face in the future.  
The analysis was performed through to two streams of action. First, a survey was elaborated and distributed to inhabitants of the city. The survey focused on their perception of the city centre and aimed at collecting their ideas and suggestions to redefine the city centre. Second, an active observation of flows and activities in the central part of the city was conducted, with methods and approaches resembling an ethnographic observation. The analysis was operationally performed by a sub-group of the ULG that organized the activities as follows:  
1. Development of an online survey that was distributed via Google Forms. The target, in terms of respondents, was set to 250 contacts. The survey was taken by 367 citizens;  

2. Observation of closed and open spaces (an ethnographically-informed type of observation). The sub-group coordinated as to have at least two observers in 6 main areas of the city centre.  


The following sections summarize the main results of the place analysis.  
As far as the respondents are concerned, their professional status was quite heterogeneous, with individuals representing all the potential occupations present in the city. While employees in office jobs represented the larger share of the respondents, representatives of a variety of other professions and occupations took part into the survey, with a relatively modest participation from individuals working in the manufacturing sector (see fig. 2).  
 
 
 
 
 
Fig. 2: Survey, respondents 
 

 
As far as age is concerned, more than 60% of respondents were aged 18-44, with citizens under 18 years of age and elders with more than 65 years being under-represented. Almost 50% of the respondents have at least a secondary school diploma, while 40% had a tertiary education credential. Even though the sampling was not purposeful and the tools used did not allow to obtain a perfectly representative sample of the city population, the correspondence between the composition of the sample and the general structure of the population was perceived as satisfactory by the ULG.  
The main results of the survey show that the city centre is perceived by citizens as substantially safe to live and walk, especially when evenings and nights are concerned. Overall, 60% of the respondents believe that “walking at night in the city centre” is safe (35%) or very safe (25%). These results tend to be encouraging, given the recent priority taken in the national and local political agenda by preoccupations related to a perceived increase in insecurity.  
As far as the fruition of the city centre is concerned, the survey showed a series of critical issues. The city centre is not the typical destination for citizens of San Dona’ on a daily basis. Probably, and given the importance of daily commuting for a large share of inhabitants, the centre is not lived as it should or could be (see fig. 3). 69% of the respondents visit the city centre less than once a week, with 21% of the respondents visiting it less than once a month.  
 
Fig. 3: Free time spent in the city centre 
 

 
As far as shopping is concerned, the survey highlights the tensions and pressures coming from neighboring large retail structures established by national and international groups in the 
outskirts of the city. Shopping is performed in the city centre only occasionally: 70% of the respondents do shop in the city centre less than once a week. As far as leisure and free time is concerned, a vast majority of the respondents said they pass it outside of the city centre, with 35% of respondents saying they prefer to visit other cities in the region. Overall, 36% of the respondents claim that the city centre is satisfactory in terms of free time and leisure offerings. These apparently contrasting trends suggest that the centrifugal forces that bring a large portion of inhabitants outside of the city tend to shade the cultural and social offerings it has and suggests the need for a strong effort to change the city perceived attractiveness. 
The survey was a useful instrument to collect suggestions from the population. The main areas of improvement that were singled out thanks to the survey were the following:  
• Improve the quality of mobility in the city centre;  

• Increase the chances and opportunities to bike around the city and the city centre;  

• Rationalize the parking system;  

• Extend and complete the recently created pedestrian zone that currently is discontinued and only partial;  

• Increase the opportunity to make Piazza Indipendenza, the largest square in the city, more attractive and enjoyable;  

• Increase the quantity and improve the quality of cultural events in the city centre. The neighboring cities as well as the commercial structures are organizing their own cultural offerings; these events are competing alternatives to events organized in the city centre;  

• Increase the availability of spaces for the younger generations;  

• Provide for the presence of a supermarket which is largely felt as missing by the population.  


The observations, meticulous and undertaken in a variety of occasions, brought to identify specific critical issues for the city centre, in particular the following:  
• The city might be, and is currently, perceived as “clean” and well maintained;  

• Nonetheless what catches the attention of citizens and observers is the visible presence of empty (commercial) spaces;  

• Green areas, public gardens and parks are perceived as abandoned and not really “lived”;  

• The city is “grey” in that it does not have colored buildings and particulars;  

• Closed commercial spaces and buildings transmit a sense of abandonment and absence of care and life.  


The results of the place analysis were taken in deep consideration by the ULG. Thanks to interactions with stakeholders, the public administration and a variety of actors, the ULG tried to formulate a diagnosis of the problems that were found. The causes of the underdeveloped potential of the city centre can be summarized as follows:  
1. Neighboring towns and the outskirts of the city host more than 20 large commercial parks, some of them are located at a 5 km distance from the city centre. Clearly these structures tend to be perceived as comfortable, clean, safe;  

2. Despite the presence of a lively cultural fabric in the city, cultural events are perceived as being scarce and not always of a satisfying quality. The absence of a palimpsest of engaging cultural events in the city centre represents a minus in terms of attractiveness and discourages actors willing to establish retail activities in the centre given the erratic nature of flows;  


3. The city is close to very attractive cities and towns: Venice, Treviso, but also pleasant and history-laden small towns near San Dona’ tend to offer a set of highly pleasurable alternatives to dwelling in a city centre which is perceived as grey and deficient in terms of cultural offerings;  

4. The city does not have a clear identity. Having a clearly defined identity and a set of precise and clear vocations for the city centre might be an attractor for foreigners and people living in other cities. In turn, the presence of outsiders might trigger the birth and development of novel economic activities in the city centre and thus encourage the curiosity of the City’s inhabitants towards a lively and populated central area. 


2. The process of action planning 
 
In the framework of City Centre Doctor, the steering individuals and groups aiming at redesigning the city centre identity, vocation and, eventually, its developments were continuously engaging with a variety of stakeholders. The main aim in the consultations of stakeholders and in the constitution of the ULG was that of providing the city with an ensemble of facilitators that might be instrumental not only in the provision of novel ideas and triggers for short-term actions but most of all to provide the city with the capacities needed to facilitate a continuous evolution and to ignite a continuous innovation cycle. Such a cycle is meant to be as participated and as democratic as possible and is imagined as relying on the activation of a larger community of stakeholders in San Donà. Such an endeavor resonates with the city being part of a Horizon 2020 Project (WeGovNow, further details in the following sections) aimed at facilitating distributed and democratic issue signaling and collective decision making processes on the future of a city.  
Since inception, the ULG has devised a flow of actions and initiatives to revive the city centre that pivoted around two main objectives:  
1. making the city centre the hub for an ecosystem conducive to novel forms of “young” entrepreneurship;  

2. Reviving the city centre and making it a place for daily life, vis-à-vis its current situation characterized by more utilitarian uses.  


An Urban Local Group (ULG) was created thanks to the inclusion of a variety of stakeholders in the city (representatives of younger generations, business organizations, retailers, experts and representatives of the public administration). The group was established on the basis of voluntary and free participation and complete openness to contributions coming from the relevant constituencies of the city. From October 2015 to December 2016 nine meetings of the ULG were held. Each meeting has been participated by an average of 15 people.  
These meetings aimed at fostering the conditions for effective networking and to create opportunities to engage heterogeneous groups in the process of planning and delivering novel initiatives to revive the city centre. The ULG was open to further contributions thanks to a variety of means, first among them an open Facebook page aimed at increasing the awareness of the ULG activities among the population and at igniting debates and constructive interactions. The ULG developed in parallel to the participation of San Dona’ di Piave to the European Project We Gov Now (as detailed in chapter 6), a project aimed at the development, deployment and exploitation of a digital platform to increase citizens’ participation in urban level decision making processes and to foster digital democracy.  
In the meetings, the ULG has constantly pondered the problems of the city centre and has thought about possible solutions. Several methods were used, from brainstorming to mind maps, Swot analyses and many others. The purpose of using data and different points of view is to make sure that there is a constructive debate. The discussion of the problems concerning the collected data had been facilitated by the ULG Coordinator and always supported by an expert facilitator. An important part of the process for the participants has been active listening to each other’s perspectives.  
The posture kept by all the participants was one that privileged constructive proposals and building on others’ suggestions and perspectives. What was carefully avoided was the stark opposition among perspectives and lingering on the responsibilities for the current state of affairs. The ULG was organized in small thematic groups that then reported to a plenary. The objective of such an organization was to present a richer picture of detailed issues and problems. Plenary discussions were key of the coordinators and the facilitators to clarify the challenges the city had to face and to trigger the planning of activities and initiatives to revive the city centre. Key tools in these discussions were the problem tree, the place diagram and a traditional Swot analysis, all suggested by the Urbact method toolkit.  
3. Focus and objectives of the Integrated Action Plan 
The entire process of action planning represented an iterative, participated and open effort in the collective design of the evolution of the city centre. Using a variety of tools as those recalled earlier and others as the Placemaking scheme, the group arrived to a shared view of the leading idea and of the underlying challenges (see fig. 4). Such a shared perspective on the city centre evolution was reached thanks to the collaboration with the University of Padova, and in particular the Research Centre Giorgio Lago, an institution specialized in producing research and consultancy concerning the transformation of the North East of Italy by mixing tools, methods and perspectives from a variety of disciplinary backgrounds.  
Fig. 4: a representation of the “leading idea” 
 

 
The leading idea might be synthetically defined as “re-using urban spaces according to a community development approach”. The idea revolves around four main thematic clusters, four conceptual pillars that constitute the backbone of the integrated action plan for the city. In particular, the four clusters might be summarized as follows: 
1. Regenerate urban spaces with the aim of fostering the birth and growth of creative activities and firms that might support local economic development;


 2. Regenerate public spaces to foster novel occasions of sociality and opportunities to re-appropriate the city centre;


3. Empower schools as a way to engage young students and talents in the process;  


 4. Regenerate the city centre with the view of making it friendly for different typologies of individuals based on their age.  


 


The main challenge identified by the ULG resonates with recent directions taken by the local administration aimed at redefining the economic and social structure of the city and at reviving its economy in a more environmentally and socially sustainable way. The current local administration has developed directly, or has inherited and developed further, lines of action and policy aimed at reconsidering the nature and functions of space in the city.  
In particular:  
1. It stopped land consumption trying to incentivize the restoration of extant real estate, the revitalization of extant buildings.  

2. It has targeted the image of a city surrounded by country parks as the direction to go in terms of urban development;  

3. It connected the development of the city with the completion of a major intermodal transportation hub that connects San Dona’ to Venice, the Eastern regions, the lagoon system and crucial nodes in the area.  


These trajectories intersect with already launched or ready-to-launch projects of recovery of extant spaces that are not necessarily located in the city centre but interact with it geographically and functionally.  
The places are:  
1. A former military base (Tombolan Fava) now being handed over to the municipality where the development of activities related to leisure, research, logistics and agriculture will be established. The base is located at the entrance of the city for traffic coming from the Northern and East quadrant of the region;   

2. The restoration of the tank located at the main entrance of the city, in front of the main bridge (Ponte della Vittoria) that is the first artifact that can be seen by traffic entering the city from the main arteries connecting it to Venice, Treviso and Mestre. Such a restoration aims at making it a social hub for entrepreneurial and social ventures launched by, and nurtured by, young talents of the city;  

3. The restoration of a large former complex dedicated to the production of wines (Ex Cantina Sociale-former Social Winery) that aims at hosting innovative retail firms and 


spaces to collect and connect young inhabitants of the city by providing a multifunctional area for cultural and social activities. The building is located in the same area of the previously mentioned multi-modal transportation hub.  


Given these premises and main challenges, the Integrated Action Plan aims at:  
1. Coalescing actors–firms, public administrations, potential entrepreneurs and service providers–that might support the creation and growth of novel entrepreneurial firms in the city;  

2. Influence local policy-making in the direction of incentivizing the use of extant–and often empty–spaces to foster novel entrepreneurial or cultural activities;  

3. Work with residents, businesses and other stakeholders insisting on the city center to recover the centre’s vitality, making it a social hub, a cultural engine and a place to live, as opposed to the current centrifugal forces that brought citizens to inhabit eminently peripheral areas of the city;  

4. Support such a transformation of the city centre through revised strategies for mobility. 


The picture here below may help in visualizing the Integrated Action Plan vision: 
  

4. Actions and schedule of the integrated action plan 
Resulting from the place analysis and from the ongoing work of the ULG, stakeholders involved in the project developed an action plan that aims at reviving the city. Such an action plan is currently being deployed in the city with beta actions that were initiated or will be initiated in the near future.  The present section of the document illustrates the actions, the beta actions and develops reflections on those actions that need to be reformulated as a result of preliminary pilots and experimentations.  
Specific objective: 1. More people in the city centre  


Action 1 
Organization of a recurring palimpsest of cultural events mixing arts and music, exhibitions of local and external creatives 

Action 2 
Organization of a palimpsest of events involving artisans and food professionals 
 
The first actions undertaken to make the first specific objective concrete (bringing people to the city centre) consisted in the planning and execution of a variety of events aimed at re-qualifying the perception inhabitants had of the city centre as a destination for their everyday life and especially as a social hub.  
The palimpsest was populated by a variety of events that mixed arts, culture and food. In particular, the following event formats took place:  
1. Dinners in music in the central square (in collaboration with local restaurants and bars and local musicians);  

2. Local markets for artisanal products of the region. These markets interacted with the existing weekly “organic food” market that is being held in the square since 2014;  

3. Artistic exhibitions in the spaces controlled/owned by the municipality in the central square, where emerging artists were allowed to show their works and to the interact with arts connoisseurs;  

4. Laboratories and events dedicated to having young children familiarize both with the city centre and with the local creative firms and associations (such as the Crunchlab, a Fablab located in the city).  


These beta actions allowed to define a timeline for the next three years, especially in terms of funding. In particular the types of activities and initiatives, adequately scaled up, might be–and will be–the object of proposals presented in European funding schemes such as Creative Europe and Cross-Border Cooperation (Italia-Slovenia) with particular reference to cultural and creative industries and culture and heritage. Beyond European funding, the ULG with steer the stakeholders, including the local administration, to look for funding in other areas, such as Foundations aiming at sustaining local economies through cultural and creative firms (e.g.: EnelCuore, the no-profit foundation established by the Italian Leading company in electricity, Enel, that annually launches calls for financing of cultural and creative activities and Culturability, an annual call for projects of urban regeneration launched by the Foundation of Unipolis, the Italian insurance and banking group). With the aim of providing immediate funding and opportunities to scale up to these projects, the ULG will also try and coordinate stakeholders in having the public administration orchestrate local funding initiatives by private sponsors.  
The main challenge for these types of events resides in their growth: the more they will be able to scale up in dimensions and thus will be attractive to larger shares of public, the more they will become financially self-sustaining, thanks to increased potential for sponsorships, ticketing and collateral revenue streams.  
 
Specific objective: 2. Recovering empty and/or degraded spaces and places in the city centre 

 

Action 1 
Bookcrossing station located in Gallerie Vidussi 

Action 2 
Regeneration of Gallerie Vidussi through the re-use of empty spaces to host novel firms in the cultural and food industries initiated by local young professionals and entrepreneurs 
 

 
The second specific objective targets a very sensible area of the city, a gallery that once was one of the pulsating social “hearts” of the city and now is semi-abandoned since the shops and spaces located there have been empty for more than a decade. The action plan aims at revitalizing the gallery by making it a destination in the city. To do so, the ULG worked synergistically with the municipality in order to obtain the opportunity to make the commercial spaces in the gallery available to young entrepreneurs for a discount. In particular, owners will confer their spaces to entrepreneurs for free for three years in exchange for the renovation of the spaces by entrepreneurs.  
As we are writing the beta action is being undertaken and two startups entered the process of being located there: one is an artisanal pastry, the other an independent bookshop. Both the activities will work synergistically to produce cultural and culinary events in the gallery as a way of revitalizing it. The initiative is part of a larger set of similar measures that will be encouraged by the fact that San Dona has become the first city in the Veneto Region to adopt a regulation that allows owners of spaces to confer them to novel activities with the aim of revitalizing spaces and then–after a period of three or more years–re-collocating them on the real estate market. The municipality and the Urbact ULG act as fundamental brokers in the process by bridging owners of real estate and prospective entrepreneurs.  
The other action that has been undertaken in the same area is the opening of a book-crossing station, aimed at attracting readers and people interested in culture, given also the coming revitalization of the gallery. The line of action does not require particularly elaborated searches for funding. The idea is that of reviving specific angles of the city by mobilizing people and young inhabitants of the city through simple events and initiatives. Concurrently, the Administrations’ measures enabling young entrepreneurs to obtain empty spaces at reasonable costs should trigger the process of repopulation of these spaces.   
 
Specific objective: 3. Exploit the value, image and brand of the Piave River 

Action 1 
Adventure River Fest. A three-day festival dedicated to outdoor activities, sports and lifestyle. 

Action 2 
Fiume Festival  and other cultural events connected to (and celebrating the) Piave river.  


 
The Piave River represents a fundamental asset for the city and city centre, since the park surrounding it is at walking distance from the central square of San Dona’ di Piave. The large green area is fit for a variety of open-air activities, it is provided with parking spaces and during the warm months it has also a restaurant/cafè operating for visitors. The identity of the city is strictly connected to the history of the River and the recent attention of the administration for outdoor/bike tourism activities make it a fundamental asset to build a novel image and identity for the city itself.  
Two actions were performed to capitalize upon this asset. The first is a three days festival dedicated to outdoor activities and sports that attracted visitors and enthusiasts from all over Italy and from neighboring countries. Demonstrations, education to outdoor sports and activities, cultural events related to outdoor life were the fundamental elements of the Adventure River Fest. The second action is an action undertaken by the municipality in the last three years that represents a template to coalesce cultural associations, businesses and representatives of the world of research on environment and urban development and it is called the Fiume Festival. The Festival takes place at the end of summer and gathers hundreds of visitors interested in the relationship between rivers, taken as examples of natural assets, cities and novel sustainable lifestyles.  
Clearly the River and its parks represent a crucial asset for the future of the city. These beta actions have the potential to make the river a strong attractor and thus to generate traffic in the city centre. Funding, in particular European funding, will be key in allowing these experiences to scale-up and to become full-fledged events able to enlarge their attractiveness. As for the specific objective 1, lines of funding such as Creative Europe, Erasmus Sports and Cross-Border cooperation Italia Slovenia are the main targets the ULG has identified. The challenge resides in the mobilization of the local administration and local partners in drafting robust projects to compete for these funds. As far as the Adventure River Fest is concerned, though, the type of event and the increasing interest for outdoor activities in the Region suggest that private sponsorships might be a complementary stream of revenues.  
 
 
 
Specific objective: 4. A greener city: mobility and cycling 

Action 1 
Promoting the culture of moving by bicycle 
 
Action 2 
Promoting the culture of walking  


 
The objective consists of a series of actions aimed at promoting a novel and more sustainable way of thinking to urban mobility and to the way in which the city is lived. The actions are inserted in a series of major results and initiatives taken by the municipality, such as the creation of specialized (and specially signaled) routes for disabled people in pedestrian roads, in strengthening and making bike lanes more secure, and in empowering local associations of bikers and walkers. The promotion of such a culture rests also on recognitions given to the city as a Bike city and on the plans of the municipality to create further bike and walking lanes especially in the city centre. The city has also adopted a Bikeplan, a strategic plan aimed at making the bike the preferred means of transportation in the urban area. The ULG has, in this action, supported and encouraged experimentations by associations of bikers that are promoting the culture of biking and associations of parents that are volunteering to support kids in going to school by walking. The major investment in this action is inserted also in the larger promotion of bike tourism in the Region thanks to the European and Regional investments and funding that are making San Dona’ a crucial hub in major bike tourism routes. In 2018, a concrete sign of the up taking of such a trend, one major hotel located in the city centre re-novated its structures with the aim of becoming a bike hotel for international and national tourists.  
 
Currently, these projects are partially sustained by the Interreg Project Italia-Slovenia Energy-Care (ENERGY efficiency actions and low-Carbon strategy for public buildings and sustainable mobility through local community engagement). The municipality is a partner in the project, led by Ater Trieste, that has a specific line dedicated to the development pedestrian and biking mobility systems. Major European lines of funding will be sought for, in particular Cross-Border Cooperation funding schemes and other dedicated to healthy lifestyles and novel mobility solutions. The ULG will also act as a catalyzer of such projects to address them to Regional and local healthcare actors and authorities, in search for endorsement and networking that might bring to the consolidation of the actions.  
 
 
  
5. Resources and delivery mechanisms 
 
The actions illustrated earlier represent the pilots of larger initiatives aimed at reviving the city centre. Each of the actions is inserted, or will be inserted, in funding schemes and attempts at attracting resources to allow their scaling up and their continuity.  
In particular:  
1. As far as the actions aimed at populating the city centre are concerned, the availability of funding and resources given in kind by local associations of businesses and firms will be crucial. Funding schemes at the European level and regional level aimed at urban revitalization will be targeted and the ULG has already identified potential avenues for further development (see specific objective 1). As stated earlier, being able to help these event scale up will be crucial to allow them to become attractive both in terms of insertion in European projects and in terms of private sponsorhips;  

2. As far as the actions aimed at capitalizing upon the Piave River as an asset is concerned, the ULG has already devised a series of strategies. The Adventure River Fest will be re-proposed thanks to the commitment of sporting equipment firms willing to sponsor the event, the sponsorship of the municipality and the attempt to attract European funds (FESR) related to tourism. On the other hand, the Fiume festival, a cultural/intellectual kermesse, will rely eminently on the coalescing of funds, services and sponsorships coming from local businesses (see specific objective 3). Also in this case, scaling up will enable these initiatives to become attractive for larger audiences, thus making them desirable for sponsors and adequate to European proejcts;   

3. As far as the actions related to novel entrepreneurship to be hosted in the city centre are concerned, the ULG already has tackled specific avenues to attract funds and resources. In particular, the regulations promoted by the municipality that allow owners of building to reconvert their assets by lending them at discounted prices for a certain number of years has been a fundamental driver in the establishment of the first two firms and will certainly be stimulating in the near future. Besides private resources being available, the ULG will continue to coalesce especially representatives of youth organizations and associations and partners such as universities, schools and close startup incubators and accelerators to provide novel businesses with services and support to grow and establish (see specific objective 2);  

4. Finally, when green mobility is considered, the municipality will be the main driver in attracting funds that will allow to revisit the infrastructures of the city and its mobility. The participation of associations (formal, such as Fiab and informal, such as the groups of parents promoting the culture of walking) will be key in working on the “soft” assets of such an endeavor (see specific objective 4).  


 
6. Adherence with the Municipality’s Plans 
The above mentioned ideas and activities fits with the strategic action of the municipality of San Donà di Piave. In fact, the ULG activated an intense relation with the municipality’s operators (directors) in different fields (urban development & planning, social, youth and sport policies, productive activities, etc…) in order to develop ideas and plans aligned with the local policies.  
In particular, 2 important “regulations” approved by San Donà Municipalities are directly connected with the City Center Doctor project and with the ULG’s work: 
1. Deliberazione n° 65 del 03/08/2017 OGGETTO: APPROVAZIONE DEGLI INDIRIZZI PER L’ATTIVAZIONE DI POLITICHE URBANE DI RIUSO TEMPORANEO DI SPAZI ED IMMOBILI PUBBLICI E PRIVATI FINALIZZATE AD INNESCARE PROCESSI VIRTUOSI DI SVILUPPO CULTURALE, SOCIALE ED ECONOMICO DELLA CITTA’: the aim of this regulation is “the activation of urban policies for the temporary re-use of spaces and buildings, public and private, in order to generate positive process of development of the city in cultural, social and economic fields” and it quotes the following sentence: “as demonstrated by the experience of the URBACT European Project, in which San Donà is the lead partner, in absence of a strong commercial and real-estate plan, a lot of spaces and abandoned areas may attract and inspire informal economies and new self-organized services for the city. Often abandoned, waiting for a final destination, they can be used temporary for specific uses, for a time that sometimes is measured in years”; 

2. Deliberazione n. 240 del 22/09/2016 OGGETTO: NUOVI SERVIZI A FAVORE DEL LAVORO E DELL’INCLUSIONE SOCIALE – APPROVAZIONE DI SCHEMA DI CONVENZIONE: the aim of the measure is to disseminate a call for interest to local associations, cooperatives and other stakeholders to define innovative projects to relaunch the local Job Center as to promote services and initiatives that might encourage the creation of novel startups by young talents as a means to revitalize the city centre.  


The alignment of the Integrated Action Plan co-created by the Municipality of San Donà di Piave with the ULG in the framework of City Center Doctor project with the other ongoing actions and initiatives, especially with reference to other international projects actually running in the area, is clear: 
 
 

 We.Gov.Now Project 

We.Gov.Now is a Horizon 2020 project establishing citizens as partners in the delivery of public services. A new type of citizen engagement platform, expanding the viability of and capacity for citizen coproduction in the public sector.
WeGovNow and its 12 partner organisations are building upon earlier research and development by further developing existing solutions and integrating them within a single community engagement platform. This platform will allow people to report problems and suggest improvements, to discuss their relevance, explore ways to fix problems through collective action, find solutions to compensate for resource shortages affecting the quality of publicly provided services, debate topics of strategic nature, and develop and vote upon concrete suggestions for local policy action.

Adherence with City Centre Doctor Project:
This project is not specifically linked to one of the Specific Objectives of the Integrated Action Plan, but can be considered as a tool to promote the URBACT approach to cities management: a bottom-up and participated approach, where citizens are the key players of the decision making process.


D-Basket Project
BAsic SKills, Entrepreneurship, Treasures of Diversity

The project’s General objective is to promote and share - through exchange of good and innovative practice and joint development - interdisciplinary educational methods and paths that foster basic and transversal skills through entrepreneurial attitudes and the appraisal of social, linguistic and cultural diversity, in order to improve teachers’ competences to work with diversified learners and address low achievement and exclusion from an early stage of education. Lead partner: INSTITUTO COMPRENSIVO ROMOLO ONOR (San Donà di Piave). Partners: Zaklada za poticanje partnerstva i razvoja civilnog društva, Elementary school Veli Vrh, City of Pula, Tandem Plus, City SAN DONA DI PIAVE, Associazione 2050, The city of Koper, Elementary school Antona Ukmarja Koper, Kulturno izobraževalno društvo PiNA

Adherence with City Centre Doctor Project:
This project fits perfectly within the “Specific objective: 2. Recovering empty and/or degraded spaces and places in the city centre”, where it states that the plan of San Donà di Piave includes actions aiming at the “Regeneration of public spaces through the re-use of empty spaces to host novel firms in the cultural and food industries initiated by local young professionals and entrepreneurs”.
 
  

  ENERGY CARE Project : Local Community in Public Buildings Energy Efficiency Improvement and Sustainable Mobility

ENERGY CARE project is part of the Interreg V-A Italy-Slovenia 2014-2020. The overall objective of the project is the reduction of the CO2 emissions, the energy consumption and the energy poverty within the Programme area, with a focus on the areas of City of Trieste, Koper and San Donà di Piave Municipalities.
Three main investments will be implemented during the ENERGY CARE project: the building of a a cycle path in San Donà di Piave. The cycle path will connect the city center with the War Memorial Retirement Home, the provincial pole of high school and the secondary school.

Adherence with City Centre Doctor Integrated Action Plan:
It is clearly in line with “Specific objective: 4. A greener city: mobility and cycling”, where it states that one of the mission of the San Donà di Piave is to promote the culture of moving by bicycle and by walking. This is also in line with the objectives of other City Center Doctor’s cities (Medina del Campo, Radlin, Nort sur Erdre, etc…) and oriented to ensure greener and more sustainable way to reach the city center.

7. Risks and lessons learned 
The main risks entailed in the follow-up to the actions hereby recalled and described are related to the lack of funding and emerging difficulties in participating into national, regional and European calls for projects aimed at reviving city centres or at fostering novel entrepreneurship especially in the cultural and creative industries. 
Clearly, such a risk is difficult to be assessed. The city, and especially the administration, has a good track record in terms of attraction of European funds and key stakeholders represented in the ULG do possess adequate experiences and network capabilities to draft convincing plans and to create European coalitions of partners.  
Nonetheless, as emphasized in the tables describing the specific objectives, the ULG has opted for a two-level strategy: on the one hand target European funding schemes and build European partnerships to chase them; on the other hand it has devised strategies to mobilize local–municipal, regional and national–sources of funding, from foundations to private sponsors.  
One of the key elements in such a strategy is the pivotal role of the administration. The ULG counts in the capabilities of the administration to orchestrate and facilitate the coalescing of resources and interests. The imminent elections might be another source of risk from this point of view.  
As far as the monitoring of the implementation of the Action Plan is concerned, the ULG has defined the key performance indicators for each action (see the previous tables) and is in the process of defining a governance structure aimed at allocating the responsibilities of each line of action on different actors and constituencies in the city.

ACTION PLAN


 
0. INTRODUCTION 
 
 
 
 
 
Medina del Campo, continuing its development strategy Medina 21, started in September 2015 a participative and integrated path by the framework of the URBACT III Project CITY CENTRE DOCTOR in order to define a common and bottom up strategy to revitalize the hearth of the city. This project, co-funded by the Municipality of Medina del Campo and by the Regional Development European Fund (ERDF), concludes now with this Action Plan, co-defined by citizens. This action plan will guide the future of the city in the next years. 
 
 
Coordinator: Municipality of Medina del Campo – Local Development Area 
Participants:  
Raquel Alonso Arévalo 





 Susana Calderón Hernández 



 

1. OVERVIEW 
 
 
 

The Lead Expert Wessel Badenhorst concluded on March 2016 the Baseline Study of the City Centre Doctor Project. The City Centre Doctor project captures the period where the ten partner cities started in early 2016 with a project to create the strategic direction and momentum for processes that will lead to the revitalising of their city centres. 
The Project is co-funded by the European Union’s URBACT III Territorial Cooperation Programme that promotes sustainable integrated urban development in Europe. 
The approach in the Project has been for partner cities to use the URBACT method to develop appropriate plans for their city centres within a global, European, national, regional and local policy context and will consist of the following elements: 
 
. Collaboration of stakeholders in each city in an URBACT Local Group (ULG) which will include action implementation extending beyond the project period as well as continuing development of related projects and programmes in an integrated sustainable manner; 

. Networking by members and member organisations in the ULG with other partner cities in the City Centre Doctor Project and with a range of other European cities and interested parties during URBACT events; 

. Transnational exchange and learning between partner cities in the City Centre Doctor Project during study visits and through providing peer to peer support; 

. Community engagement in the process of understanding and analysis of city issues and in developing and testing ideas for actions; 

. Integrated Action Planning by engaging the ULG to understand their city centre challenges and opportunities from its social, economic and environmental development perspectives and to design actions that will have impacts across all three strands. 


 
Partner cities in the City Centre Doctor Project has developed integrated action plans to revitalise their city centres thereby creating environments more conducive for businesses to be competitive. Successful implementation of actions will contribute to the achievement of Thematic Objective 3 of the EU Cohesion Policy: Enhancing the competitiveness of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). 
The following organisations are project partners: 

 
 

All the cities are small (less than 100,000 population) and are located in proximity to larger cities which determines the patterns with regard to the flow of goods, services and people in their local economies. 
 

  
2. CITY PROFILE 
 
 
 
Position, potential and challenges 
 
In Medina del Campo the history of Spain can be experienced on its streets, its public places and in the cluster of historical buildings in the city centre. This is the city of Isabella, Queen of Spain. This is the city of the Feria – the Fair. This is the city of the Plaza Mayor. 

 
This is the city that was bequeathed to Isabella, who made it her principal residence. In this city the Royal Provision was signed to commission the Third Voyage of Christopher Columbus to the New World. It is also the city where the measures were taken to establish the Inquisitional Tribunal. It is also the city where the Queen in her final days dictated a codicil to her will in which she declared that the people in the Spanish colonies will have the same status as subjects of the Crown as the people in Spain1. 

 

The most prominent building in the city is the Castle de la Mota, built by King Juan II and completed by his daughter Isabella on the hill close to the city centre. This is also the main tourist attraction, but there is a frustration that many tourists do not also visit the city centre with its range of historical palaces, convents and museums. The concern is that these historical buildings and the Plaza Mayor are not visible for visitors from the vantage point of the Castle, because of the residential apartment blocks constructed in the 1970s that obscure the view.  
 
The challenge is to communicate to visitors the advantages of visiting the centre before they make their travel arrangements and to increase the walkability and signage to help visitors to get to the 
centre. Medina del Campo is currently part of a cohort of places in central Castilla y Leon that attract day trips from Madrid and also includes the Rueda wine route and the city of Valladolid. 

In keeping with its reputation as the ‘City of Fairs’, Sundays is a normal trading day in Medina del Campo3. The city’s heritage as an important centre of commerce stems from the 15th and 16th century when it was the location for the General Fairs (public markets) of the Kingdom where everything was for sale. The Plaza Mayor de la Hispanidad was the centre for all this activity. Today the Museo de las Ferias in the city centre gives a great insight into the development of commerce from its roots in 15th century Medina del Campo. 
 
As would be expected, a city with such heritage value will have a prominent cultural events calendar. These include some of the oldest processions in Spain during Holy Week as well as one of the oldest traditional running of the bulls in honour of San Antolin, the city’s patron saint, in the first week of September.  
 
With attractions such as the Palacio De Las Salinas, Medina del Campo can confidently compete as a regional and national tourism destination. 

 
 
There is however, a concern that reliance on tourism alone is not sufficient for a sustainable local economy. Even traditional manufacturing such as furniture making, for which the city has a good reputation, is under strain.  
 
The challenge is to nurture an environment for local entrepreneurs to start new businesses and create jobs. 
 
The city officials view the participation in the City Centre Doctor Project as an opportunity to facilitate processes that will start new initiatives to establish a positive environment for entrepreneurs in the city centre. The Municipality is committed to assist new businesses with a suite of supports including financial assistance of €1,000 for start-up costs and €1,000 for costs of contracting employees together with a reduction of local taxes and charges on the business premises for the first year. 
 
In discussions with local entrepreneurs, it is clear that the passion is there as well as the belief that the city is well positioned for new businesses with its connectivity to large centres such as Madrid, Valladolid and Salamanca together with good quality of life factors such as the gastronomy, the schools and the areas to live and work in Median del Campo. 
City’s demographic trends 
 
The city has a population of 21,305, which is a 7% increase in the intercensal period from 2001 to 2011. The economic functional area includes 35 villages within a radius of 10 km that together with Medina del Campo has a population of approximately 60,000. 

 
 
Two demographic trends are of concern for the Municipality. The unemployment rate increased significantly over the intercensal period from 9.3% in 2001 to 23.2% in 2011. The skills levels of a large proportion of the working age population also makes it difficult for transferability to new types of jobs. The chart below shows a small proportion of the population with post school qualifications. It also shows significant improvements over the intercensal period. 
 

 
There is also a trend toward using private cars for everyday commuting. The chart below shows how walking and cycling as a mode of transport have decreased and how the use of the car has increased over the intercensal period from 2001 to 2011.  

 
 
 
The increase in car use is matched with an increase in traffic congestion, especially in and around the city centre. 
 
City’s co-location with a large city 
 
The city of Valladolid with a population of 311,500 is located 45 km from Medina del Campo. There is a regular train service with trains arriving and departing every 30 minutes.  
 
Among the local business community there is a sense that the retail offer in Medina del Campo is lagging behind the offer in Valladolid both in range and in quality. The belief is however that with a focus on local produce, quality design and presentation as well as creative and targeted marketing the local retail offer can compete with the larger city. 

 
The high local unemployment rate necessitates that local residents will have to commute longer distances to find work. It is therefore critical to have good transport systems to link Medina del Campo with as many other urban centres as possible. The advantage for the city is that three major road transport corridors intersect close to the city namely the A6 motorway from Madrid to A Coruna; the E80 motorway from Bilbao to Portugal via Burgos and Valladolid; and the “Corredor del Duero” linking Zamora with Valladolid. 
 
The connectivity of the city with Madrid by train will improve in 2016 when a new AVE route from Madrid to Galicia will include a stop in Medina del Campo. This will make the commuting time to central Madrid (St Martin Station) only 1 hour.  
 
City centre snapshot 
 
The Plaza Mayor is the centre piece of the city centre of Medina del Campo. The layout and size as well as its uses became the template for all Spanish cities. Today the square is surrounded by historical buildings and the main area for commercial activity in the city. It also connects with seven streets into all directions with the rest of the city. 
 
 
To maintain its heritage brings a number of challenges to the city. Most of the buildings in the city centre are listed as of historical importance. This according to Ruben Herrera, the chief architect of the Municipality, makes it very difficult to initiate new development and to ensure that landowners maintain buildings to an acceptable standard. The Municipality have a policy to improve the appearance of the historical centre and initiated a programme, budget permitting, to contribute 50% to the restoration costs for private residential buildings. Nevertheless, there are a number of buildings that have fallen into decay thus detracting from the effort made to restore and maintain adjacent buildings. 

 
 
The centre is also experiencing the effects of traffic congestion with too many cars, too little parking space and the ‘crowding out’ of pedestrians and cyclists. The absence of cycle lanes in the centre is conspicuous. Although the Municipality has clearly made an effort to improve public realm in the centre, it has not yet put in place measures to reduce car use.  
The permeability and walkability of the city centre should be a main priority if the Municipality hopes to attract more visitors and new businesses to the centre. It could be possible that the city will learn from other partner cities in the City Centre Doctor Project about measures to reduce car use in the centre. 

 
 
City centres are successful if people and stakeholders work together with the aim of making their place a destination. The Hospitality Association of Medina del Campo is such an example where the bars and restaurants work together to ensure that their facilities and leisure spaces are clean, pleasant and family friendly. The Association also organises local events such as barista and tapas competitions to facilitate skills development and food and drink innovation. The Association encourages its members to serve local produce and specialities and to promote the traditional events that the city is famous for such as the processions and the running of the bulls. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Project plan for the city’s participation in Phase 2 of the City Centre Doctor Project 
 
Management of the Project 
 
City Partner Project Manager: David Muriel Alonso, supported by Alberto Lorente Saiz; 
 
ULG Coordinators: Juan Alonso, Eva Quevedo and Juan Gonzalez; 
 
The project is managed as part of the Medina 21 Programme which is well established and guided by its strategic plan for the sustainable and inclusive development of the city. 
 
Focus on specific challenges for the city centre 
 
The main challenges identified by the URBACT Local Group (ULG) that will form the basis for deliberation and development of action plans include: 
 
• Improvement of the conditions for living and working in the city centre. 

• High unemployment levels and the local measures to create jobs, in particular, initiatives to help new businesses getting established in the city centre. 


• Enhancements to the historical and heritage elements of the centre to increase its tourism potential. 

• Measures to improve sustainability that will also result in a better quality of life for the residents of Medina del Campo. 


 
Existing municipal policies and strategies 
 
The current policies and strategies of the Municipality to address these challenges include: 
 
• Measures to rehabilitate buildings and the public realm. 

• Interventions where lands and buildings have been abandoned. 

• Creating databases and providing online information on the business activities in the city including job opportunities. 

• Financial support for entrepreneurs. 

• Developing a new mobility plan including a feasibility study for a new bicycle  infrastructure network for the city. 

• Continued administrative and coordination support for the Medina 21 Forum and the implementation of its Strategic Development Plan. 


 
Establishment of an URBACT Local Group 
 
The URBACT Local Group (ULG) for revitalising the city centre of Medina del Campo was established in November 2015. It is a sub-group of the Medina 21 Forum which is the coordinating structure to implement the Strategy for the sustainable development of the city of Medina del Campo. 
 
 
The ULG includes representatives from self-employed professionals, Engineers, Unemployed, Entrepreneurs, New technologies, Consultants and Tourism. Other stakeholders who form part of the Medina 21 Forum are also invited to send representatives such as social and community groups as well as political organisations. 
 
The ULG is coordinated by a triumvirate who have agreed to work in a complementary way namely a local entrepreneur with language and facilitation skills; a consultant with experience of European projects; and the manager of the local tourism services. 
 
The ULG will in addition to its reporting line into the City Centre Doctor Project, be administered in terms of the operational procedures for Medina 21. This will require the recording of meetings and the accounting of the use of resources. 
 
Objectives for the project (Added value for the city) 
 
The project objectives that the ULG have agreed that will guide the city’s participation in the City Centre Doctor Project include: 
• To involve young people in the development of actions to revitalise the city centre and to ensure inter-generational cooperation. 

• To examine initiatives such as co-working spaces and story-telling as new means to use existing resources in the city centre that will create a positive environment for start-ups. 

• To build the Medina place brand. 

• To engage residents in place making activities that will foster a pride of place. 

• To learn from other cities especially about new methodologies and technologies and the innovation of city services. 


 
Learning and transnational exchange of good practice and experiences 
 
The exchange with other partner cities will be a good opportunity for the ULG and the broader Medina 21 Forum to pursue the following learning goals: 
 
• Updating the work methodology of Medina 21. 

• Discover good practices in other cities. 

• Develop relationships with other European cities of similar scale and with similar challenges and initiatives. 

• Develop innovative actions. 


Medina del Campo will also be a good case study for partner cities to learn about the role of the market square from history as well as contemporary practice. The Plaza Mayor is today the centre of activity in the city as it had been over the centuries. It influenced commercial activity in all the cities of Spain. This showcase will be complemented by a visit to the Museo de las Ferias. Few cities have a museum that captures the development of commerce in the city. Delving into history could also provide clues for revitalizing our city centres today. 
 
The second element that visiting cities might find interesting is the demonstration of the hyperlocal approach by focusing on development and presentation of high quality local and traditional products and thereby enhancing the retail offer for visitors and residents alike. 
 
It is planned that the learning and demonstrations of actions and good practice experienced by ULG members and city officials will be disseminated via e-mail and other online communication platforms, but also importantly, that it will be discussed in local meetings and workshops. This is in accordance with the practice of Medina 21. 
 
Integrated Action Plan for the city centre and future funding opportunities 
 
The ULG anticipates that throughout the project period it will engage in extensive consultations with the local residents and stakeholders to develop actions that will form part of an integrated action plan for revitalising the city centre. Many of the actions will be additional to the existing policies and strategies of the Municipality. 
 
The engagement of stakeholders through the Medina 21 Forum and the inculcation of the Local Agenda 21 methodology as a means to foster collaboration is a good practice that will be of interest to other partner cities in the project. 
 
The Municipality believes that with the new integrated action plan for the city centre, it will be in a position to access funding from the ERDF Operational Programme for Castilla y León 2014-2020 specifically to implement actions related to the following thematic objectives: 
 
Axis 1: Research, technological development and innovation maximization. 
Axis 3: Improving the SMEs competitiveness. 
Axis 6: Preserving and protecting the environment and resource efficiency. 
 
 
 

3. PLACE ANALYSIS  
 
 
 
Survey Questionnaire 
 
The place survey questionnaire aims to gather information about how users of the city centre perceive their city centre. The Place Survey of Medina del Campo had 25 questions, some of them obligatory and other optional. The Place Survey of Medina del Campo followed the basis and structures defined in the City Centre Doctor Project.  

The survey is organized in seven fields, each one of them with several questions about a specific topic, but always in relation with the citizens and their perceptions about the city centre.  
The seven fields are:  
. Personal information 

. Duration and way to arrive to the city centre 

. Security  

. Frecuency and assiduity 

. Causes and motivation to choose the city centre  

. Time 

. Place 


 
The survey was made online and phiscal format in toder to achieve more participants, for example, people who have not internet access as over +65 people. Confidentiality was securded during all the process.  
The survey was made by 225 people during the months of July and Auguts (2016).

As for the assiduity to the urban centre of Medina del Campo is very high, as much for the realization of purchases as for reasons of leisure, whether or not in summer season. A very large majority choose it for the meeting with friends in bars, cafes or restaurants. They also opt for the urban centre for clothing and footwear purchases or supermarkets. In relation to the services rendered in the locality, the most used by the citizens are the toilets and mails. 
 
On the one hand, satisfaction over the business hours and leisure time is high. However, despite this, in the choice of shops they prefer to buy outside of Medina, not so if we ask about leisure. On the other hand, the preferred place to do business or work is the urban centre, but in contrast to this, respondents see little chance of finding work in the urban centre or surroundings. 
 
Therefore, it would be desirable for citizens to change their perception of the possibilities to find employment or start a business in Medina del Campo. Therefore, institutions are working to promote self-employment and create initiatives to motivate the population to create new businesses that meet new market needs. For example, from the City of Medina del Campo have launched aid to entrepreneurs. 
 
The objective of this work has been to expose what are the perceptions of the citizens about the urban centre, in particular the security and the reasons of their choice. This implies the implementation of active policies to improve and maintain the urban centre of Medina del Campo. 
  
Results of the place observation activity 
 
This activity was organized the 5th July of 2016 and all ULG members were divided in 4 working groups in order to do it. The activity was focused on the “Plaza Mayor de la Hispanidad”. 
 
The topics addressed by the four working groups were: 
- Access and connections of the public space 
- Comfort and image 
- Use and activities 
- Social 
 

Access and connections 
Most groups agree that there is a good connection between space and adjacent buildings. In relation with the pedestrian access, in the observation it is stated that it is easy to walk around 
the square except for defective areas of pavement and canalization. Likewise, access to adjacent areas is comfortable. The observation shows the difficulty of access to the square in various means of transport. Except for the access of vehicles during loading and unloading hours, it is only possible to access the square on foot or leave the car in adjacent areas. 
Finally, all groups consider that the space is generally adapted to people with disabilities or special needs, although it is proposed to use pictograms to improve the use of space by such people. 
In the following framework it is possible to see the comments that were made during the activity in relation with this topic by all groups:  

To continue : 
Good access from the pedestrian point of view 
 
 
In general, it is considered positive that cars do not enter and that it is pedestrian 

 
 To improve :
 

 Access not so good for people from outside and have to arrive by car or other means.

  Accesses do not comply with regulations regarding timetables or traffic signals. For example, during loading and unloading times.
 Bad connection from the point of view of having to carry the purchase from far away for the inhabitants of the area itself, for being pedestrian and not being able to access with your car. 
 
 
 The merchants consider the loading and unloading schedules essential and consider that there is a lack of parking nearby. 
 
 
 It highlights the lack of information on where the square is and other information in order to improve access, connection and use by visitors and other citizens who do not know the space. 
 

Comfort and landscape.

As for the comfort and image of the square, asking if the space makes a good first impression, generally the answer is positive and they are agreed with the idea of the monuments impress visitors. On the other hand, the impression caused by the poor state of the pavement is again highlighted, as well as a wide space without elements that complement it (generally there are only benches, litter bins, lampposts and trees). As for the location and number of places to sit, there are opposing opinions, two of the groups consider that there are not enough banks, on the contrary, the other two groups consider that there are many banks and terraces. Suggestions include the improvement of public banks and more shade (with the use of pergolas or change of location of banks). 
The answer is negative and unanimous regarding the cleanliness of the square, all groups consider that it is not clean. However, all groups respond positively in terms of feeling safe in the square. Likewise, all groups agree again that it is usual to see people taking photos in the square, a place that offers numerous possibilities for taking photos. 
Finally, there is discrepancy regarding the dominance of vehicles in the pedestrian zones of the square. On the one hand, it is clear that the vehicles do not occupy the pedestrian zone except during loading and unloading hours, on the other hand, it shows the confusion that is sometimes created by not respecting loading and unloading schedules or spaces of transit or directions of circulation. 
In the following framework it is possible to see the comments that were made during the activity in relation with this topic by all groups:  
 
To continue :
The arcades are good 

It is the traditional meeting point but ""it does not invite"".

To imporve: 
 Hard benches. Unpleasant surroundings to stay longer. 
 
 
 Lack of shadows. Pergolas are proposed. 
 
 
 ""In summer you are churning and in winter you freeze."" 
 
 
 It looks like an ""inhospitable"" 
 
 
 Lack of freshness. For example, a fountain, colours, etc. The centre of the square is empty. 
 
 
 Buildings in poor condition. 
 
 
 It is the traditional meeting point but ""does not invite"". 
 
 
 The question of furniture needs to be improved. 
 
 
 There are elements that distort it. ""You have to remove the junk."" Example: Lamps are ""horrible"" or wiring. 
 
 
 The most valuable and patrimonial elements go unnoticed. 
 
 
 It gives a feeling of disorder. 
 
 
Use and activities 
 
As for the use of the square, everyone agrees that space is used by people, but also indicate certain hours of greater influx. Similarly, all groups respond that space is used by people of different ages. 
In the square there are many activities, children playing ball, skating, walking, eating, people sitting, walking. It also notes the use of space for activities, events and shows. 
As for the most used areas of the square, the use of terraces, arcades and benches is highlighted. In general, the whole square is used although the centre is a large empty space that is normally used by children to play. Likewise, all groups indicate that there are numerous options of things to do in the square, such as leisure and play for children, catering and trade for tourists and visitors as well as habitual purchases for residents. 
Finally, almost all the groups could not identify a responsible person in charge of the management of the place, although it is pointed out to the city council and coordination of services in one of the answers. 
In the following framework it is possible to see the comments that were made during the activity in relation with this topic by all groups:  
 
 
 
To continue :  
The square controls all social and economic life. Example: walk, children. 
Good coexistence between economic activities and services. Collaboration. 

 To improve :
 


 Conflict between some activities. They affect the coexistence between uses. Example: Bicycles, children playing ball and older people. 
 

 Bad uses of space: Beating, ballooning to heritage, etc. 
 


 
Social.

All groups point out that the square is a meeting place where it is usual to stay with friends and that people are also speaking in groups. In general, people seem to know each other by faces as well as by their own name, plus space is used regularly and by choice. 
 
On the other hand, people do not seem to be smiling for all groups, although there is a visual contact between people. Finally, there are discrepancies in the existence of a mixture between ages and ethnic groups reflecting the community in general. It also indicates that each community meets, but separately. 
 
To continue :

Meeting place, chat, play. 
 
 To improve :
 


 Each group is by its side. They are divided by ethnicities, countries and do not interact. Conflicts can occur. 
 
 
 There are residual cases of fiddles or illegalities. 
 
 
 The police only act if you are warned. They are not proactive. 
 
 
Additional information (Maps) 
 
During the observation, plans were distributed of the Plaza Mayor with the most representative elements. Each group added notes in these planes with the most relevant information observed placing that information in the corresponding part of the plane. By way of example, the plane of one of the groups is shown below.

We created three working groups (habitability, social aspects and economic activity), and made a practical study visit to the Historical and Commercial Center of the Villa, with a subsequent pooling of the Notes made that we structure in the following groups: positive, negative, challenges to realize and things to improve. 
 

 
4. THE PROCESS OF ACTION PLANNING 
 
 
A strategic approach from the beginning 
 
The City Council of Medina del Campo began the new millennium with the creation of the Local Development Service and the implementation of sectoral development plans that have marked a path of intense work and have been the germ necessary for Medina del Campo to participate now in different European projects to continue improving in a balanced and sustainable way social, environmental and economic aspects that contribute to a high quality of life. 


 
Just in 2000, the City Council created a Local Development Service, which during its first two years, launched four strategic lines of development with a planned character: The Local Agenda 21, the Programme for the Promotion of Self-employment, the Tourism Promotion Plan and the Open Shopping Centre. 
In 2002, the City Council started its Local Agenda 21, which includes relevant social, environmental and economic aspects to move towards local sustainability. Within the system of indicators of Local Agenda 21 there are indicators that address the three aspects mentioned, 
including the unemployment rate by gender, economic activity licenses, environmental management systems of companies or licenses granted for the restoration of buildings, among others. 
 
The Local Agenda 21 of Medina del Campo was born as a strategic action plan, agreed upon by all inhabitants through a participatory process initiated in March 2002, to advance towards the sustainable development of the municipality. This plan guides the participation through the principles proposed by the European Guide for the Planning of Local Agendas 21 of ICLEI and the Code of Good Environmental Practices of the FEMP (Spanish Federation of Municipalities and Provinces), with the following objectives: 
. Strengthen the capacity of local government to solve social, economic and environmental problems. 

. Disclose existing problems. 

. Develop procedures that include and enhance citizen participation in the search for solutions. 

. Effectively implement tools and instruments for strategic planning and environmental management. 

. Make Medina del Campo an example of a sustainable municipality that improves the quality of life of its inhabitants. 


Thus, it constitutes a transversal axis that articulates the rest of strategic plans through the design of a system of indicators, action plans and specific tools of transversal articulation, all coordinated from the Local Development Service of the City Council.  
Within this area of work, during the year 2004, aware of the importance of employment to achieve local sustainability, the City Council of Medina del Campo creates, as a work area of its Local Agenda 21, the Local Action Plan for Employment (PALE), on the basis of the Capacity methodology (Training and Capacity Building for Local Action Planning for Employment) of the ICLEI and the Directorate-General for Employment and Social Affairs of the European Union. Medina del Campo became the first municipality to conclude the strategic planning phase of an experience of this type developed in Spain. 
The CapaCity project (in which the staff of the Local Development Service and A21soCtenible receives training) has two major frames of reference: the European Employment Strategy and Local Agenda 21. CapaCity is based on the results of the pilot project ""LANE, Local Network for Action Plans for Employment"", also developed by the European Commission and led by ICLEI and involving six European cities: Amaroussion and Kalithea (Greece), Hannover and Heidelberg (Germany), Calviá (Spain) and Helsingborg (Sweden).  
Having overcome a first phase of strategic interventions in the municipality in which sustainability criteria and citizen participation were applied, it became necessary to implement a Strategic Development Plan that would bring together all the previous lines of intervention and that, by generalizing good practices implemented during the previous years, would unify 
the planning processes under the sustainable and participatory criteria of Local Agenda 21 and the Local Action Plan for Sustainable Employment (PALE). 
These initiatives culminated in 2007 with the implementation of the Strategic Plan for the Sustainable Development of Medina del Campo, Medina 21, which is still in force and operational today, and from which arise the different programs currently developed by the City of Medina del Campo. 
Medina 21 is an heir to the experience acquired during the last decade in the implementation and application of local development models, plans and programs. Medina 21 was launched with the aim of joining social, economic, political and technical efforts to establish a sustainable development strategy, shared by citizens, that improves the quality of life in Medina del Campo, favouring development processes in the medium and long term. 
With this working philosophy, based on the strategic planning policies carried out in the municipality in terms of employment, tourism, trade and environment, the Strategic Plan for Sustainable Development relies on criteria of territorial balance and citizen participation, applying European working methodologies adapted to a specific local environment  
Medina del Campo, in this sense, presents itself as a dynamic municipality that during the last years has tried to coordinate structures and development plans of sectorial scope through forums and programs that with more or less success, have introduced new concepts and working ways that make possible today the implementation of a new planning cycle of Medina 21.  
 
The Citizen Commission of Medina 21 was born with the spirit of coordinating the activities generated and at the same time promoting the active and direct participation of the citizens of Medina del Campo in this Citizen Commission. 
All this without forgetting that Medina del Campo has a driving effect in its region as it is the head of the Region ""Tierra de Medina"". This region encompasses 31 municipalities and is characterized by important agro-food and tourism resources.  
The town maintains its fair, mercantile, logistic and service character through heritage elements that define the Historical and Shopping Centre (Plaza Mayor de la Hispanidad, the ""Museo de las Ferias"" Foundation, Theme Park ""Villa de las Ferias"" and ""Reales Carnicerías"" market), facilities (Open Shopping Centre, National Cattle Market and Furniture Trade Area), and events (Medina Sunday and Fair Plan). All these elements and others (sanitary, rail transport with other cities of Spain, Portugal and France, etc.), make Medina del Campo the logistics and service centre of the more than 50,000 inhabitants that populate the region.                           

 
 
 
 
                                                                                           
Under the premises of sustainability and citizen participation Medina 21, structures itself as a development strategy constituting a path shared by citizens and the rest of the public and private entities of the ""Tierra de Medina"" in the achievement of objectives and concrete projects shared by all. With three sectoral action plans, they bring together 10 priority projects each in the fields of habitability, economic activities and social aspects, and are implemented through technical working teams which meet at least once every two months and create specific working groups when any of the projects so require. 
 
With all the participation forums open directly to citizens, volunteers, technicians and politicians, Medina 21 has already implemented two programming periods (2007-2011 and 2011-2016) and during 2016 addresses the last details of a new programming period 2017-2021 which includes, for the first time, a transversal and integrated line of work called Medina 21 Europe, in which two European cooperation projects are carried out in a participatory way (City Centre Doctor in URBACT III and Rural Growth in INTERREG EUROPE) along with the present Strategy of Sustainable and Integrated Urban Development. 
 
The results to date have been very satisfactory both from a quantitative point of view (more than 70% of the projects considered as strategic have been implemented and a remaining 15% have been initiated) as well as at the qualitative level by introducing a bottom-up working methodology and on the basis of respect and valorisation of our resources in a sustained, respected and unanimously supported by public administrations and the City Council itself manner. 

 
 
 
City Centre Doctor Process 
 

Since 2015 Medina del Campo participates in the “City Centre Doctor” project, within the European cooperation programme for Sustainable Urban Development URBACTIII. This project has helped to integrate new methodologies and visions into the Medina 21 experience and is getting very good results to revitalize the urban centre through the participatory methodology URBACT.  
 
 
City Centre Doctor has been the first European project in Medina del Campo and it represented a big impact in the motivation of the citizens. After the kick off meeting in Sopron and its public presentation in 2015 more than 40 volunteers asked to be part of Medina’s ULG. This motivation has continued until today, through different meetings at local and at international level, thanks to a good job and communication between the Municipality, the ULG moderators and all the ULG participants. 


In order to summarize all the official ULG meeting, we show them in this framework:

Other ULG activities 
 
The most important activity has been the exchange process with other cities. Medina del Campo, its staff, politicians and citizens had the opportunity to cooperate and exchange ideas with representatives of other 9 European cities through different international meetings. In these meetings, all participants were able to share ideas and points of view about their own cities, their challenges and about how to work with them. 
 

 

Between these international meetings, on 5th, 6th and 7th September 2016 Medina del Campo organized its international meeting with representative from all the partner cities. It was a successful meeting specialized in participatory dynamics, where all participant were able to learn about participatory processes with Sally Kneeshaw, but also to discover the potentialities of Medina del Campo.  
 

 
 
Another important milestones were URBACT events like URBACT Summer University in Rotterdam and URBACT City Festival in Tallin. They were during August 2016 and October 2017. URBACT Summer University took place in Rotterdam, in which 3 representatives from the participation forums of Medina del Campo took part in the event and exchanged experiences, methodologies and new ideas that were later embodied in this Action Plan. At the same time, URBACT City Festival in tallin in October 2017 was also a good event to discover urban good practices to apply in Medina del Campo. 

 
 
Furthermore, it is important to underline the collection of ideas process for the actions to be included in the action plan. The Municipality of Medina del Campo implemented several participatory actions like the Ideas prizes through its participatory APP Medina 21 APP, a participatory dynamic with scholars, and a participatory dynamic in the Main Square, with volunteers of DESES3 Association and the Erasmus Plus program, on 29th March 2017.
 
 
5. FOCUS AND OBJECTIVES 
 
 
 
 
 
Problems and obstacles 
 
After the identification of the main problems of the city centre of Medina del Campo, its needs and its main assets, it is fundamental that the Action Plan intends to reach a series of urban challenges. 

 
After the previous analysis, we defined the most important barriers that Medina del Campo has in relation to the development of its city centre: 
Vulnerability 
 Problems and obstacles for the development of the urban center 
 

R+D+i 
 Lack of modernization and disconnection between the services of the local administration and the citizens 
 
Economic 
 High rates of unemployment in the local and regional context, with special impact on the young and female population over 45 years 
 
Environment 
 Local heritage with urgent conservation and valorisation needs 
 
Climatic 
 Disconnection between urban areas and urban itineraries not accessible and in conflict with the motor vehicle 
 
Demographic 
 Abandonment of the young population, relative aging of the population and serious risk of depopulation at local and regional level 
 


Social 
 Groups at social exclusion risk, due to lack of employment and opportunities, especially in the young and female population over 45 years of age 
 


 
Urban challenges 
 
After the definition of the main barriers, the Urban Local Group defined the urban challenges of the city centre of Medina del Campo. Urban challenges follow the challenges posed by the EUROPE 2020 Strategy and the ERDF operational program, in their thematic objectives. That is why citizen participation was very useful in the relationship between needs, potentialities and urban challenges of the city centre of Medina del Campo: 


Need : 
The citizenship increasingly requires a more efficient local public administration; 
 
The citizenship requires more IT infrastructures for its leisure, administrative tasks but also for its businesses and jobs; 
 
In addition, it demands more information and better communication skills with the local administration. 

Potentiality :

To be more efficient in the resources used by administration management and to achieve a greater and better impact of public services on citizens. 
 
Participation in the European CityFied network and previous experiences in transition initiatives towards a smart public administration 
 
Previous experiences like Medina 21 APP 

Urban Challenge :
Transition to a more efficient and smart local public administration and more smart services, that respond to the new needs and profiles of citizens 


Need :
 
Aging of the population and reduction in the mobility of elderly people 
 
Pedestrian itineraries and public buildings that are not universally accessible 
 
Need for itineraries where motor vehicles, bicycles and pedestrians live together 
 

Potentiality :
Improve the living conditions and accessibility of people with reduced mobility to different buildings and public space 
Greater use of low-polluting means of transport and reduction of CO2 emissions 

Urban Challenge : Achieve an universal and integrated accessibility in the urban centre and safe and sustainable urban mobility for all the users of the city 
 


Need : Disconnection between important areas of the city such as train stations, Regional hospital, courts, historic centre, Main Square, etc. with distances that can reach more than 1.5 km and up to 3km (distance between traditional train station and Regional Hospital) 


Potentiality :
Connect areas of the urban area that have an important role in the regional context (Tierras de Medina county with more than 70,000 inhabitants) such as the regional hospital or the courts with the train station and the historic centre with all its offers of services; 
Improve the connection and access to local and regional interest spaces by local users and the entire region; 

Urban Challenge :  Connecting these areas through a means of public transport that is efficient and has zero emissions and that has a great impact at social level and at a local and regional level

OBJECTIVES 
 
The main objective of this Action Plan was defined at the beginning of the project like project slogan. The Urban Local Group of Medina del Campo decided that this slogan could represent their main ambition for the city centre. 
In this sense, the main objective for this action plan is: “Revitalize the city hearth of Medina del Campo”, understanding the revitalization as an integrated process. Integrated because it includes social, economic, environmental, cultural and institutional areas. 

The following graphic gives a sense of the main areas that could be considered, in the Integrated Action Planning process followed in Medina del Campo: 

After the definition of the main urban challenges, and following the traditional structure of Medina 21, the Urban Local Group decided to synthetize the main objective in four specific objectives: 
Economic:  Strength commercial initiative in the city centre and consolidate it as a centre of services for the Tierra de Medina county (60.000 inhabitants);
 

Social: 
 Fix young population and generate opportunities of life (services, job, leisure and environment) for young and elderly people, with special attention to improve the city “eco-system” for young people. 
 
 
Environmental: 
 Recover and put in value the local heritage in the city centre as elements for tourism, culture, businesses, leisure and public services; 
 
Liavility and cityscape: 
 Improve accessibility and mobility in the city centre and its connections with other urban areas; 
 



 
 
6. ACTIONS AND TIME SCHEDULE 
 
 
 
Beta actions 
 
According the working plan of City Centre Doctor project, Urban Local Group on DATE defined some beta actions that were tested during several months, through these actions, we underline: 
Underground Cellars 
 
The staff of Medina del Campo with some volunteers worked to create an inventory of underground cellars in the city centre of Medina del Campo.  
Medina del Campo has many meters of underground cellars that were operating for centuries under the houses of the city centre. Old people say that Medina has an underground city under its city centre.  
In this sense, the ULG decided to recover this heritage that could represent an opportunity for tourism and quality businesses. This beta action will continue as one important action in the action plan. 
 

 

Zapardiel river recovering 
 
The recovering of the Zapardiel river was also one of the key element in the ULG sessions. ULG members propose many ideas for the local river. The main idea was to recover its path (nowadays, dry and acting as a border between urban districts) as a public space for walks, sports, etc. also beautifying its channel. ULG took the example from other Spanish cities like Valencia (traditional path of Turia river) or Elche (Vinalopo river). 
However, after some meetings with the stakeholders of the river (mainly the hydrographic confederation who legally manages the river), we concluded that it is not possible to implement this kind of actions, and they recommend us to only act on its beautifying. 
 
 

 
Recovering the Simón Ruiz Hospital 
The Simón Ruiz Hospital (2 hectare of dimension) is located in the city centre of Medina del Campo. It is a hospital that was buildt in the XVI century. 
 
It is a space whose dynamization would be able to guarantee an impact that exceeds the local scale and reaches the entire Tierra de Medina region and the 29 municipalities that encompass the Rueda Wine Route. 
The idea for this building is to create a HUB understood as a creative and innovative eco-system for youngsters, young artists and young entrepreneurs. 
During the City Centre Doctor project life, ULG members and entities like the University of Valladolid, the University of Newcastle (through Rural Growth project) or Santa María la Real Foundation  have analysed potentialities and opportunities for this historical building.

According to gathered and presented data, ULG members on numerous meetings discussed about main problems and did problem trees. After discussion about defined problems, ULG Coordinator did the unified Problem tree with main problem and three supporting problems with its causes and effect. There are many more causes leading to problems but the focus was on including cause that stakeholders can affect on. ULG than concluded Problem tree by defining problem combining all three defined problems as Not sufficient used potencial of city centre. 

FOCUS

This is particularly important with regard to the fact that in the last census period due to immigration there has been an increase in the number of inhabitants, but also in view of intentions aimed at intensifying the development of tourism. 
Currently in the wider area of the center there are a large number of abandoned and devastated buildings that need to be renewed and transformed / put into operation and need to be invested in all types of infrastructure to enable urban development and development of the center but also increase the availability of services and quality of life. 
The problem of regeneration of the urban center of the city is extremely complex given the concentration of services, institutions and infrastructure represented in the center itself. 

Therefore, it requires solving problems from practically all the domains analyzed and satisfying the needs of the inhabitants of not only Petrinja, but all 54 villages that gravitate to the urban center. 
Focus of this Integrated Action plan lies on several themes that are important for Petrinja and are coordinated with URBACT City Centre Doctor Strategy as well as with Petrinja Main Development Plan. This themes are in particular:

1. CONTEXT 

1.1. INTRODUCTION 

The City Center Doctor project is one of 21 network action plans co-funded by the URBACT III Program, a territorial cooperation program of the European Union that helps cities in sustainable integrated urban development. 
The City Center Doctor project is the partnership of ten smaller cities in ten European countries located near major cities. The project partners are Naas (Ireland), Medina del Campo (Spain), San Doná di Piave (Italy), Radlin (Poland), Idrija (Slovenia), Valašské Mezirící (Czech Republic), Petrinja (Croatia), Heerlen Nort-sur-Erdre (France), Amarante (Portugal). The main partner is the City of San Doná di Piave. 
The City of Petrinja joined the project at phase 2 of the project, which began on 3 May 2016, and the implementation lasted 24 months. The total budget of the Project is EUR 647,597.92 and the ERDF co-financing is EUR 481,464.19. The budget of the city of Petrinja amounts to 40,862.32 euros, and the co-financing of the ERDF amounts to 34,732.97 euros. The Lead Expert of the project is Mr. Wessel Badenhorst. Project leader for Petrinja was Mrs. Vlasta Vuglec, and the coordinators of ULG were Mrs Željka Tonkovic, Mrs. Katarina Ivancic and Mrs. Lana Modrovcic Ljubojevic. The project's objective is that partner cities develop co-operation mechanisms and integrated action plans that will stimulate the revitalization of their city centres. 


1.2. CITY CONTEXT 

1.2.1. Location 
The City of Petrinja is located in the central part of Sisak-Moslavina County, south of the river Kupa, before its entrance in the Sava River. It is 60 km away from Zagreb and 40 km away from Pleso International Airport (Zagreb). The administrative area of the City of Petrinja covers a total of 55 settlements. 

The total area of the administrative unit of the local self-government of Petrinja (all 55 settlements) is 380.65 km2 which is 8.52% of the area of the county. The surface of the Petrinja settlement itself is 41.64 km2. According to the 2011 Population Census, the city has 24,671 inhabitants, accounting for 14.3% of the population of the county. With a population density of 64.81 square meters / km2, it is among the more populated areas within Sisak-Moslavina County (only Sisak and Kutina have a higher density of population), ie in the order of middle-populated areas in Croatia.

Geographically, the area of the city is located in the zone between the mountain hinterland and the river Kupa's lowlands. The area is characterized by relief diversity manifested in the modalities of mild hills, and the overhanging of plains and fields along river flows. Only the Petrinja settlement is located on the right bank of the Kupa at the mouth of the Petrinjcica River, and the central and most part of the settlement is located on its right bank. 

City of Petrinja with inner centre 

The city of Petrinja has an exceptionally favorable traffic position on the crossroads of traffic routes connecting northwestern Croatia and Zagreb with Banovina and Bosna, and Banovina and Kordun area with Posavina. At the city level, the most developed is road traffic. Railway traffic has lost its importance since the railway line passing through the City is not in function anymore. Petrinja does not have air traffic infrastructure, and river traffic needs to be investigated with respect to the waterways of the Kupa River. 

1.2.2. History and heritage 
Petrinja has been mentioned since 1240 and it is assumed that it was at that time an urban whole. In today's location, it emerged in 1592 as a Turkish fortification of Hasan-pasha Predojevic. At the end of the 16th and 17th centuries, Petrinja was an important fortress in the defense system. In the middle of the 18th century it was handed over to the Banska Krajina, hence the name of the entire area of Banovina. Then the fortress was rebuilt and the settlement spread outside its walls. Already in 1765 Petrinja had 500 houses. Due to the underdeveloped market and poor purchasing power, most of the residents, along with crafts and trades, had to deal with agriculture to survive. 
Today, the outlines of Petrinja take place at the end of the 18th and early 19th centuries, with a spacious central square framed by military and church buildings and late-baroque civilian houses. In Petrinja, pottery, pottery and carnivorous (strong meat fair) are being developed, and at the end of the 17th century some members of the Gavrilovic family, begin supplying meat products the army and the civilian population of the town, which marks the beginning of the meat trade in Petrinja. From 1809 to 1813 Petrinja was under the rule of France. With the rebuilding of the Vojna Krajina, Petrinja loses the status of the Military Community. After the final demise of the Croatian-Slavonian Military Krajina in 1881, Petrinja became part of the Zagreb County. It is constantly evolving, so that in the beginning of the 20th century economic growth can be experienced. 
Stjepan Radic and his Croatian Farmers Party (HPSS) occupy a significant place in public political life, and the 1st Assembly was held in Hrastovica in 1905 at the house of Stjepan Šimunovic. 
1900 the mayor, Djuro Gavrilovic, who is the organizer of the census, has a special economic and political committee, encouraged the foundation of the city's town hall, city sewerage, and electrical lighting. In 1902, the construction of the railway bridge at Petrinjcica was completed and the ""Banovina railroad"" was put into circulation during Mayor Ivan Borošic. 
The period from 1907 to 1914 at the time of the Mayor Dragutin pl. Simoncic is considered to be the true bloom of Petrinja. At that time, extensive works on Petrinjcica regulation, electricity lighting, water supply, sewerage, sidewalks and so on were completed. 
At the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th century, ""The First Croatian, Sausage and Dried Meat of M. Gavrilovic's sons in Petrinja"" started to work. The factory became more and more recognized year after year, and for ""Croatian salami"" it was awarded a gold medal at the international exhibition in Vienna. 
Since 1922, construction of the city sewerage has begun, and has begun thanks to the sold logs from the city forest ""Kotar"". Since 1929 Petrinja and the majority of Banovina are part of the newly established Savska banovina with headquarters in Zagreb. It was then part of the Primorje-Krajina region with headquarters in Karlovac. 
1930 Petrinja's statistical data are as follows: it extends over a surface of 40 km2, has 968 houses and 6137 inhabitants. 
In early 1963 the Statute of the Petrinja Municipality was adopted, covering 22 places and surrounding settlements. 
1958 asphalted road Petrinja-Sisak, and three years before the transport company ""Slavijatrans"" became an independent company. Gavrilovic started construction of a new factory, a construction company ""Buducnost"" was founded, and ""Forestry"" became part of the Sisak Forestry Company. 
In 1961 the Pedagogical Academy was founded and a new school building was started. In 1965, MI ""Gavrilovic"" was rebuilt and next year the Furnace Factory. 
During 1978. the town plan of Petrinja was adopted. At that time, the Radio Petrinja, the Music School, the Library and the reading room, the Foreign Language School, the Auto School, the Library and the reading room, the INDOK (Information Documentation Center), published by the ""Petrinjska novina"" were active at that time. 
In 1980, the ""Petrinjka"" department store was opened, covering 3.800m2, and the following year a census was conducted, with the municipality of Petrinja having 33.570 inhabitants and 
10.079 apartments with 9.887 households. 
In 1984, a new City Market was erected. 
At the beginning of 1990, the founding of the first political parties (HDZ, HSS, HSLS, HDS, etc.) began in Petrinja, and this was the beginning of a new political reflection on reality, a new political arrangement -the beginning of a multi-party and democracy. 
Beginning of riots and armed rebellion of Serbs came on the end of September 1990. 
The first barricades and armed guards on Petrinja begin to paralyze traffic. Political unrest lasted until the beginning of September 1991. when the first attack from the then ""Vasilj Gaceša"" barracks took place on the town. The first victims are falling and many people are wounded. The bloody period began for Petrinja. After 21 September 1991, Petrinians are in exile, and the city is still devastated. 
During the Homeland War and numerous military actions, the most significant and long­awaited military and police operation was the „Storm“ which, in 1995, liberated the territory of Petrinja. During the entire period of the war Petrinja and Petrinians filed large victims. The city is systematically devastated. There are 599 defenders and civilians killed, 89 are still missing and there are eight mass graves in the city.

The rich history of the town of Petrinja is also reflected in the preserved cultural and historical heritage. In the area of the city there are numerous archaeological sites, sacral and civil buildings, memorials, memorials, ethnological heritage as well as a protected cultural and historical complex in the center of Petrinja and near Strossmayer promenade. Many of the sacred buildings were destroyed in the Homeland War and rebuilt after the war. 
The culture of life and work is an essential factor of the characteristics and identities of each community. For Petrinja, there is a significant tradition of the meat industry and trade fairs and events related to the production of meat and meat products. There is also pottery as the oldest and sometimes the most widespread craftsmanship developed due to high-quality clay foundations, folk songs and singings, customs and traditions, handicrafts, wool processing, beekeeping, falconry and folk costumes. 
During the year, numerous events (60 of them), which have a local character, are held in Petrinja. Most of them occur in the summer months (June, July, August). By grouping manifestations (Summer in Petrinja, Lovrencevo et al.), their significance and tourist attractiveness are increased, and the number of visitors is increasing.

1.2.3. Population 
According to the Population Census of 2011, 24,671 persons live in the town of Petrinja, out of which 15,683 live in the city and 8,988 in other settlements. Knowing that the administrative area of Petrinja has a network of 55 settlements with as many as 30 settlements with less than 100 inhabitants, it is clear the presence of depopulation of rural areas and the complexity of ensuring the availability of public services. The aging trend of inhabitants of the entire area of Petrinja has been highlighted, but the increase in the number of inhabitants as a result of immigration to the area of the city has been taken into account in the strategic planning of document. 
Division of population 


The average population density in the area of the City of Petrinja is 64.81 per square km, which is more than the county average (38.60 per square kilometer) but less than the average of Croatia, which is 75.71 per square kilometer. 
In the age structure of the population of Petrinja, the working population aged 15 to 65 (65.70%) predominates, which is roughly the same as at the county level (65.96%). Population aged 65 and over is 18.62% less than the county average (19.53%), but above the state average (17.70%). The young population (0-14 years) in 2011 was 15.67% more than the county average (14.51%) and slightly above the state average (15.23%) but less than 2001. (17.17%). Out of the total population 51, 64% are women and 48.36% men. 
Age groups 


Given national affiliation, the Croat population prevails (84.82%), followed by members of the Serbian national minority (10.98%) and Bosniaks (1.56%). Other nationalities account for less than 1% of the total population. In the population structure with regard to religion, Catholics (80.36%), Orthodox (10.42%) and Muslims (2.46%) prevail. Members of other religions singly make up less than 1%. 
1.2.4. Public and social activities 
In the area of the City of Petrinja there is a kindergarten with one central and 3 district facilities (a total of 501 children). 5 primary schools with branch departments (1848 total students), 1 secondary school with educational programs: general gymnasium, food technician, veterinary technician, meat shop, florist and fruit-vinegar-winery (453 students total) and high school University of Zagreb) with 514 students. In the education of adults in the area of the city there are three institutions: the Center for Plum and Chestnut -a public institution founded by the City of Petrinja and which carries out programs of adult education for specialized occupations in agriculture, primarily in fruit and vegetable farming and independently and in cooperation with other institutions in order to improve the institutional infrastructure in the fruit growing, but also the overall rural development of this area; Open University Croatian Home Petrinja is the leading institution in the area of the City, the founder and owner of the City of Petrinja, dealing with the organization and implementation of programs related to culture, art, education and adult education; Public Open University College Kotva -a public institution for adult education, founded in 2001, which offers education programs to help regulate the labor market and solve the problems of illiteracy and thus unemployment. 
Primary health care and social care services in the area of Petrinja provide health care, general outpatient clinics (10 teams), pediatric outpatient clinics (2 teams), dental clinics (7 teams), gynecologic ambulance, 1 public and 3 private retirement homes and home for mental health sick adults. 
In recent times the role of civil society organizations is growing. Many civil society organizations are involved in settling various social needs, exploring different problems and updating them. 
In the Register of Associations of the Republic of Croatia (May 2016), there were 223 active associations registered in the territory of the City of Petrinja. The number of civil society organizations is one of the main indicators of civil society development. By comparing the number of associations with the number of inhabitants according to the 2011 census (24,671), we come to the data that there are 9,03 associations per 1,000 inhabitants, which is slightly less than at the county level (10,49). With regard to the field of activity, most sports associations, 45 of them, are the associations of cultural and artistic (40), human rights organizations (18), sustainable development (18), democratic political culture (14), protection and rescue (12), veterans' association (7), etc. 
The analysis of the area identified the lack of sports facilities, children's playgrounds, social homes, a short lack of social infrastructure that would be the driver of improved citizens' lives, and interventions aimed at creating spatial conditions for the activities of numerous associations, creating new social services and better conditions for the implementation of educational programs and free time of citizens. 

1.2.5. Employment/Unemployment 
Analysis of the area determined the area of the town of Petrinja as a place still under influence of war events, whose population decreased in 2001 by an exceptional 33.4% compared to 1991. War events also affected spatial devastation and the current disenchantment of the wider urban area. The industry-based economy did not survive either in the rest of the country, and the process of transformation and privatization of large corporations in the 90s (Slavijatrans, Finel, IGM Ciglana, Gavrilovic) did not succeed in pre-war business while part of the company ceased business. Petrinja therefore still has a high rate of unemployment and an unfavorable labor market situation related to vulnerable groups, especially young people, who do not have the opportunity to work. 
Unemployment in the City is one of the biggest developmental problems and in 2015 it was 22.2% (annual average). According to CES data, in the year 2016 there were 2729 unemployed persons (quarterly average), of which the relatively high number of those with 3-year high school education (914), followed immediately by the following primary school (813). Due to age, two groups -the unemployed between the ages of 20-24 and unemployed between the ages of 45 and 59 -are treasured. Regarding gender, 56.6% of the unemployed are women, with the unemployed men 43.4%. Out of the total number of unemployed, 11.5% of the wages are spent on defenders. There is also a significant number of defenders, of which 3500 are recorded in the area of the City, of which 1000 are disabled. 
The next major vulnerable group consists of persons with difficulties in carrying out daily activities, according to which according to the 2011 census of population in Petrinja there are 
5.182 inhabitants, which makes up to 21% of the population of the City. Women prevail with 51.5%, and the largest age group is the population aged 50 and over (most people aged 75-79). Given current activity, according to the 2011 Census, in the City of Petrinja there were 10,945 economically inactive persons, most of which (6,278) are left to pensioners also included in the potentially vulnerable group. 
Part of the socially vulnerable picture is also provided by the Social Welfare Center. The table below shows data on beneficiaries of social welfare rights in the area of Petrinja, from which it is clear that the largest number of recipients of the minimum guaranteed benefits -640 single and households, ie 1,556 persons covered, representing 6,31% of the total population of the City . Considering that this share at the level of Croatia is 2.4%, it is clear that the share of beneficiaries guaranteed minimum fees in the CSSS Petrinja area is even three times higher. 
The mentioned problems of the area of the city of Petrinja represent a permanent obstacle in achieving a higher degree of development of the area and the city vitality index and are the starting point for determining the city's needs for its regeneration. 

1.2.6. Natural resources 
According to CORINE (CooRdination of INformation on the Environment) identification, the city has many natural and spatial reserves. The largest reserves are found in forests and agricultural areas. Relative disparity is also one of the comparative advantages of the City, as it offers the possibility of spatial planning in line with sustainable development and the real needs of the population. 
The town of Petrinja is rich in water. Water wealth is a network of underground and surface watercourses and springs of drinking water (Zrinska Gora is one of the three richest potentials in Croatia). Surface watercourses that characterize the area of Petrinja are the river Kupa, Petrinjcica and Utinja. The town of Petrinja is located on the right bank of the Kupa, and most of the town stretches to the right bank of Petrinjcica. The Rijeka Cup, whose total length is 296 km, with a valley through which it runs 100 m in the left and right of the river, is proposed for protection as a monument of natural heritage in the category of significant landscape. 
The area of the City of Petrinja has significant forest wealth. The total area of forests in the area of the City of Petrinja according to CORINE Land Cover classification from 2012 is 12.961,65 ha and is divided into three categories: white-wood forests, coniferous forests and mixed forests. In total, predominant forests of chestnut, oak and grab with a significant share of oak are prevalent. It is estimated that in the area of Petrinja-Glina-Dvor, ie between the rivers Kupa, Gline and Une, there are between 15,000 and 20,000 ha of chestnut forests, of which about 40% of the town of Petrinja belongs. Given the purpose, the forests in the area of the City of Petrinja are mostly for economic purposes, which, with the preservation and improvement of functions, implies use for the production of forest and timber products. 

1.2.7. Economic structure 
Economic trends, although pointing to the growth trend of entrepreneurs, are not favorable. Namely, the economy is experiencing a falling trend in income and profits with entrepreneurs, as well as a decline in the number of employees. Regarding the number of entrepreneurs themselves, a positive trend needs to be emphasized -in comparison with 2010, in 2015, there were more than 36 entrepreneurs in the City of Petrinja. However, as noted above, newly­established businesses and their employees could not compensate for a general downturn in the number of employees in the enterprise, which is due to the number of employees in 2015, almost by 500 less than in 2010. Business Comparative Business Comparisons (2010-2015) show that in the five-year period, the economy of the city has experienced a tremendous decline in economic activity, which is reflected in the decline in entrepreneurial income by 43.5% and loss of nearly 500 jobs, accounting for one third of all employees in 2015 . 
The city's economy relies on the partly renewed business of large companies and less on small and medium-sized businesses, which points to the need to strengthen small and medium-sized businesses. By ending investment in entrepreneurial infrastructure (entrepreneurial zone), a predisposition is created for new investments that will generate new jobs. The intervention defines infrastructure investment and services that can support businesses and start-ups, thus stimulating (only) employment and increasing the competitiveness of economic entities. 
Agriculture has been identified as the power and opportunity of the area of Petrinja, but large weaknesses, with small holdings, have small production capacities and low technological facilities. During the process of drafting this intervention plan, there was also a shortage of human capacities that would embrace contemporary ways of production in agriculture. The interventions will be directed to existing local produce producers whose production is based on the exceptionally long tradition of food production areas. Through the strengthening of the activities and capacities of the public institution in the field of agriculture, support will receive all key stakeholders for the further development of the sector. 
Tourism is at the initial stage of development, but as an opportunity to see the growth trend of visits to continental destinations in the Republic of Croatia, the intervention plan envisions a significant investment coverage as a support to the development of this sector. Petrinja abounds in rich natural heritage and rich in material and immaterial cultural heritage, and the proximity of larger urban centers (within one hour of driving) puts the city in a favorable position with respect to other continental destinations. Growth of entrepreneurs, employees and income in the sector was recorded, which is another reason to rely on the planning of interventions. 
The area of the City of Petrinja has significant forest wealth. The total area of forests in the area of the City of Petrinja according to CORINE Land Cover classification from 2012 is 12.961,65 ha and is divided into three categories: white-wood forests, coniferous forests and mixed forests. In total, predominant forests of chestnut, oak and grab with a significant share of oak are prevalent. It is estimated that in the area of Petrinja-Glina-Dvor, ie between the rivers Kupa, Gline and Une, there are between 15,000 and 20,000 ha of chestnut forests, of which about 40% of the town of Petrinja belongs. Given the purpose, the forests in the area of the City of Petrinja are mostly for economic purposes, which, with the preservation and improvement of functions, implies use for the production of forest and timber products. 

1.2.8. Summary of relevant operational programmes (ERDF i ESF) 
The program of Integrated Physical, Economic and Social Regeneration of Small Towns in War­affected Areas is implemented by the Ministry of Regional Development and EU Funds (MRRFEU) and the Ministry of Labor and Pension System (MRMS), using funds from the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESI Funds) . The program primarily involves integrated urban regeneration of 5 pilot areas of small towns for implementation of IPs for each of the cities, which will then serve as the basis for the implementation of individual projects that contribute to the development priorities and objectives set out in the intervention plans. Apart from the intervention plans itself, the program also encompasses the development of institutional capacity of key stakeholders to implement integrated interventions and complementary activities at the central level: improved poverty statistics at local and regional (regional) level and appropriate mapping of poverty. Vukovar, Beli Manastir, Petrinja, Benkovac and Knin MRRFEU has been selected by the Decision on Pilot Areas for the Implementation of the Integrated Physical, Economic and Social Regeneration of Small Towns in War-affected Areas from 18 February 2015 on the basis of the following criteria: population size from 10,000 to 35,000 inhabitants) and the state of occupation during the aggression against the Republic of Croatia. 
The Integrated Physical, Economic and Social Regeneration Program for Small Towns in War­affected Areas is funded by two funds: the European Regional Development Fund (EFRR) and the European Social Fund (ESF), ie two operational programs that determine the strategic and operational modalities of their use : Operational Program ""Competitiveness and Cohesion"" 2014-2020 (OPKK), specific objective 9b1 -Sustainable physical, social and economic regeneration of five deprived pilot areas with the aim of reducing social inequalities, exclusion and poverty and complementary activities of a specific goal 9.i.2 -Strengthening active inclusion through the implementation of integrated renovation projects 5 underdeveloped pilot areas of the Operational Program ""Effective Human Resources"" 2014-2020. (OPULJP). Total allocation from the two operational programs for the period 2014-2020. is EUR 120m, with 100m from EFRR and 20m from ESF, with 15% of national co-financing. 
In line with OPKK, two main expected results of EFRR and complementary use of ESF within this program are as follows: 
• 
Improvement of socioeconomic and living conditions in at least five small pilot cities with 10,000 to 35,000 inhabitants, which will reduce further population losses. Intervention packages will result in regeneration of degraded areas and contribute to reducing inequality, social exclusion and poverty, and 

• 
Designing and testing a new model for access to regeneration of deprived areas based on addressing the socioeconomic deprivation problem concentrated in a geographic area. The programs are designed as integrated territorial investment modeled on a model of integrated territorial investment developed for larger urban agglomerations within the regulatory framework for ESI funds. This model is suitably adapted to the needs and institutional capacities of small and multiple deprived cities. 


2. PLACE ANALYSIS 

2.1. URBACT LOCAL GROUP PETRINJA 

The URBACT methodology points to a project process that begins with a systematic analysis of challenges, policies and trends that form project goals together with the analysis of specific challenges and operating modes in each city partner. The project represents the starting point and the focus. 
In a two-year process, each project establishes a local co-operation mechanism called URBACT Local Group (ULG) for the development of an integrated action plan through the learning process and exchange at the transnational level and at the local community level. After two years of project, plans and results of process processes will be the basis for capitalization of knowledge, which will also show progress made from the basic study. 
The ULG meeting moderates the ULG Coordinator. During the duration of the City Center Doctor project, ULG Coordinators were Mrs. Katarina Ivancic, Mrs Željka Tonkovic and Mrs. Lana Modrovcic Ljubojevic. Petrinja’s ULG has been established with organizations from the public, private and civil sector. All individual representatives actively worked at the ULG meeting, participated in the workshops and conducted indicators to prepare the Analysis of City Center Points. 
Sector No. Organization 	Representatives 



Members of ULG Petrinja met many times to talk, think and express their individual opinion on the center of Petrinja. The meetings facilitated the ULG coordinators by tools and methods such as problem tree, SWOT analysis preparation, city center mapping. 
Each member of the ULG participated in gathering city center information through an analysis of available city center information (from strategies, data and articles) and using tools -a site survey poll and list of locations agreed between all project partners to kick off a meeting in Heerlen that was prepared and presented by the leading project expert, Mr Wessel Badenhorst. 

2.2. CITY CENTRE OVERVIEW 

The urban part of Petrinja dates back to the first half of the 18th century. In that period, the main streets of the city we know today are recognizable examples of baroque and classical buildings. The city center, located at the intersection of several communications routes, is characterized by Strossmayer's promenade, a city park with ornamental plants and rare trees protected by the category of landscape architecture. The square with parish church and promenade remains the main urban city accent. 

City of Petrinja Centre 
The city center of Petrinja is protected as immovable cultural property in the Cultural Property Register under the name Z-2122 Cultural and Historical Background of Petrinja. Within the center are some thirty buildings that are also protected as unique cultural assets. Some of them have already been renewed using the Croatian Energy Efficiency Program funds, but are mostly in poor conditions for war and age. These buildings are mostly state-owned and private, so it is difficult for the city to affect the owners to renovate the facade. Also, almost every building on the ground floor has business premises. Many of these spaces are empty and lack business activities. 

Two state roads pass through Petrinja (D30 Zagreb-Petrinja-Croatia Kostajnica and D37 Sisak­Petrinja-Glina), which bring heavy transit traffic to the city center and endanger the safety of road users in the city center, especially pedestrians and cyclists. These state roads go through the streets of Nazor and Turkulin, the two streets with the highest concentration of trade and which are, or should be, the shopping streets. 
On the west side, the center of the town is bordered by the river Petrinjcica and the promenade leading to the town's beach. In 2015, a 400-foot track is paved, and bench seats for seating glass canopies are on the promenade. Citizens of Petrinja of all profiles (athletes, families with children, young couples, senior citizens) like to spend their free time on the promenade and on the beach, especially in the summer months. 

In the center of the city are four squares: Square of Croatian defenders, Petra Preradovic's Square, Teachers Square and Stjepana Radic's Square. Croatian Defenders square is the largest public space to use. 

2.3. PLACE ANALYSIS 

In addition to existing data sources, the ULG used a tool to get new information and a more subjective view of the city center by observing the site. Members of the ULG conducted observations in July 2016. Members of the ULG conducted observation in pairs. At the second meeting of the ULG, the following locations were agreed: Strossmayer promenade, Croatian defenders Square, Stjepana Radic's Square, commercial streets Nazorova and Turkulinova, Petra Preradovic's Square, Teachers' Square and City beach and promenade along Petrinjcica river. 
The observation of place gives insight into some problems and irregularities in certain public spaces. People's opinions and impressions are the basis for defining the major city center problems. 
An opinion poll was also conducted (Questionnaire). The purpose of this questionnaire is to make residents think of the center of the city they live in. The study was conducted during July and August 2016 for the period from July 26 to August 31 (37 days). The research was conducted in two ways: on-line -through Google forms and on the field -completing the questionnaire in physical form, the city market and inventories during market days. The representatives of the ULG group from the City of Petrinja and the coordinator of the ULG Petrinja Development Agency were responsible for the research. The survey was conducted on a sample of 340 citizens of Petrinja. 
The survey included 29 questions. Research questions were predefined for all partner cities on the project with a total of 25 questions, and for Petrinja we added 4 more personalized questions. 
More about the results and data of this research can be found in the Place Analysis / Place Analysis document. 

2.4. PROBLEM DEFINING 

After observing and analyzing the site and carrying out the survey site survey, ULG members defined the main problems using the problem tree method. The ULG Coordinator included all the tools that were used up to this time, including challenges defined in the lead study of Lead Expert when applying for a project, and a comprehensive conclusion among ULG members. 
According to the collected and presented data, members of ULG at a meeting in October, three groups discussed major issues and made three problem trees. The first group defined the problem of ""Dense traffic in the center of the city"", the second group ""Destroyed and empty buildings in the city center"", and the third group defined the main problem of the ""Unattractive Center of the City"". 
After discussing defined problems, the ULG coordinator made a unique problem tree with a major problem and three supporting problems with their causes and consequences. There are many more causes that lead to problems, but the focus was to include the causes that stakeholders might be affected. ULG locked the problem tree by defining the problem by combining all three defined problems as ""Not sufficient used potential of city centre"". 


The URBACT local group conducted a survey of site observation and site analysis for citizens to think about the city center in terms of business, public spaces, city center security, and subjective impressions in the city center. All the information gathered was used to define the main problems of the city center. 
The main problem is defined as „Not sufficient used potential of city centre“ with the accompanying difficulties in the narrow sense defined by the ULG: heavy traffic in the city center, destroyed and empty buildings in the city center and unattractive city center. 

3. FOCUS AND OBJECTIVES 

3.1. FOCUS 

By investing in the city's urban center, which is a gathering place and concentration of services and institutions, the city's attractiveness increases for residents as well as visitors. 
This is particularly important with regard to the fact that in the last census period due to immigration there has been an increase in the number of inhabitants, but also in view of intentions aimed at intensifying the development of tourism. 
Currently in the wider area of the center there are a large number of abandoned and devastated buildings that need to be renewed and transformed / put into operation and need to be invested in all types of infrastructure to enable urban development and development of the center but also increase the availability of services and quality of life. 
The problem of regeneration of the urban center of the city is extremely complex given the concentration of services, institutions and infrastructure represented in the center itself. 
Therefore, it requires solving problems from practically all the domains analyzed and satisfying the needs of the inhabitants of not only Petrinja, but all 54 villages that gravitate to the urban center. 
Focus of this Integrated Action plan lies on several themes that are important for Petrinja and are coordinated with URBACT City Centre Doctor Strategy as well as with Petrinja Main Development Plan. This themes are in particular: 
1. 	
Regeneration of urban center (Petrinja -a modern city) 

2. 	
Support to the development of small and medium entrepreneurship (Petrinja -Entrepreneurial Town) 

3. 	
Improving the Social Standards (Petrinja -a city of educated and satisfied people) 

4. 	
Development of tourism (Petrinja -tourist town) 


VISION of this Integrated Action plan is: 
Through the modern redevelopment of city centre Petrinja is a city of pleasant living that meets the needs of its inhabitants. 
3.2. OBJECTIVES 

Along with the analysis of the site, defining the problem and creating the focus, a graphical representation of the area of the encompassing plan with the vision of linking all ""main urban points"" -public spaces with public character (squares, parks, public buildings) through a quality communication network that was made primarily by focusing on pedestrian and cycling traffic. 

With the proposed objectives and actions, the city center becomes more compact, homogeneous, more attractive for citizens and more traffic and infrastructural. 
Priorities of the Integrated Action Plan action plan are: 
• 	
revitalize the city centre with a series of interventions on the main urban points that serve to gather more people and concentrate urban activity (squares, streets and other urban areas) 

• 	
improve the urban transport system including infrastructure, transport network and types of transportation 

• 	
make a number of measures consistent with the City's economic development strategy that will stimulate its development in all segments 


Key objectives of the Integrated Action Plan are: 
1. 
Revitalization of major urban areas 

2. 
Improving the City Traffic System 

3. 
Improving the economic situation of the City through a series of measures that will reduce the high unemployment rate and stimulate economic development (in line with the City's Main Development Strategy) 


These key objectives are in line with the City of Petrinja Action Plan and its development goals: 
Space: DG1: Developing projects have to create inclusive infrastructure and visually attractive city identity 
Economy: DG2: By creating a stimulating environment, ensure the development of small and medium entrepreneurship in the area of Petrinja 
Society: DG3: Increase the number of inhabitants and improve the quality of life through the development of educational, cultural and social services and infrastructure in the local community 

4. ACTIONS 

4.1. REVITALIZATION OF MAJOR URBAN AREAS 

The revitalization of the main urban areas is a key goal that involves a series of actions to revitalize city squares, parks and urban areas that are recognized as crucial in the urban network of Petrinja. 
Included are: Strossmayer Promenade, Croatian Veterans 'Square, Croatian Teachers' Square, Petar Preradovic's Square. In addition to the ""City of Kupa"" project, a series of interventions for the activation of old and new urban spaces within the city beach / promenade, the promenade along Petrinjcica, recreational and sports areas are being implemented. 
4.1.1. Revitalization of Strossmayers promenade 
Strossmayer's promenade in Petrinja was proclaimed in 1969 as a monument of park architecture and enrolled in the Register of Protected Natural Values as a horticultural monument. The park-shaped square in the center of Petrinja is 125x140 m in size, 1.5 ha in front of the main facade of Baroque parish church Sv. Lawrence with a recognizable stylistic composition of the baroque stars. The park was built during the 18th and 19th centuries. 

The park is perceived by citizens as the heart of the city and the place where they prefer to stay. The ULG has created new possible activities that can be maintained at this site and which will further activate this urban space and will collage all other planned activities. 
The city plans to renovate the square, incorporate new equipment and encourage the use of the square by new buildings in new and interesting ways. An example of such a successful action is the ""Urban Parktivity"" action, which was carried out on 20.05.2017. and had a good response and success. 
Through relatively simple preparations and several held internal meetings, members of the ULG organized a morning social gathering with the citizens in the park with the promotion of healthy lifestyle and physical activity. The citizens had a chance to see the demonstrative exercise of the Shotokan Karate in the performance of Karate Club Petrinja, to practice yoga organized by Igor Žilic and to dance with the leader Josip Trklja, and their work was presented by the students of the Petrinja High School and OPG Medicinal Herbs. The members of the ULG have enriched the program by signing the „Petrinjka to Petrinians“ petition, where citizens could give their signature for solving the state property issues in the city center. Surprisingly great response, citizens supported this kind of cooperation between the City and the civil society and demonstrated to ULG members that they are ready for changes in the city center. 
Following the success of this action, new actions of a similar type are being planned, which will encourage citizens to make more use of this public space, as well as to healthier life in general (sport, recreation, nutrition ...) 


4.1.2. Revitalization of Teachers square 
In the Teachers square, which is recognized as one of the most valuable urban public spaces, fairly safe from traffic, several actions are planned, aimed at boosting the integration of citizens who gravitate to the public space (retirees, young people, occupants of surrounding buildings) and at the same time make this area more attractive. 
Tactile garden for elderly people 
With the aim of bringing older people's activities into community life, a tactile garden is planned. 
Plants have a relaxing and soothing effect and create a natural pleasant atmosphere. The plan is to allow an older population to plant medicinal herbs and make them an active member of the community. Each plant must have a sign with its name, its properties and its healing properties. Some of the planted plants would be mints, peppermints, sage, chamomile, calendula, rosemary, lavender and so on. The older population can also use plants that they planted themselves. 

Renovation of wall on bowling building 
The idea is to arrange the citizens to arrange the walls around the devastated and abandoned bowling alley. The arrangement will remove offensive graffiti and inappropriate content and beautify the square and encourage citizens to articulate. 

4.1.3. Revitalization of Croatian Defenders Square 
The Croatian Veterans' Square is the nominally the main city square and the best place in the city for gathering a large number of people, but it is still not used enough. The problem is the inactivity of the main building of the former Petrinjka department store. 

The plan is to encourage artists, volunteers and all interested to ""take up"" the square and erect the walls of a devastated department store and decorate them with positive themes and colorful stories, promoting love, tolerance and progress, while covering old graffiti and offensive content. 
The City will also try to arrange a square with new urban equipment. 
4.1.4. Revitaliazation of Petar Preradovic's Square 
Petra Preradovic Square is the only town square that is not adequately decorated as a square and is not recognized by people as a gathering place. 
The town of Petrinja is planning to renovate or edit the square and the town market connected to it through a project worth 11.500.000 kn and decorate it, people still do not understand this space as a square. Through a series of actions and infiltration activities, street performances and the like, it is still necessary to work on changing and raising the awareness of citizens to start experiencing this place as a square. 

4.1.5. „City on Kupa“ Project 
The City of Kupa project encompasses a series of activities on the revitalization and activation of important urban space: the promenade along Petrinjcica and the town beach of Kupi. All this space, as a place for rest, recreation and sports activities, is important for the city of Petrinja. 
The intention is to add value to this area through a series of projects such as: a new beach renovation project, a city beach building, new sports and recreational buildings, renovation of old buildings with a new purpose (library, multimedia center) and improved communal infrastructure. Projects within the City of Kupa project are worth HRK 55,000,000. 


4.2. IMPROVING THE CITY TRAFFIC SYSTEM 

Improving the city traffic system is a key goal that seeks to address so many problems in the city center that are directly and indirectly caused by the existing traffic system. 
This includes finding ways to reduce transit traffic, creating opportunities to relocate a major state road from the city center, encouraging the use of alternative means of transport (bicycles, etc.). Particularly planned to update the existing transport infrastructure in order to be safer and more acceptable for the use and life of Petrinja residents. 
4.2.1. Reducing transit traffic through city centre 
This action includes a series of efforts to find a solution to reduce transit traffic in the city. 
Coordination of the City with relevant state agencies is needed in order to find possible solutions that include: cessation of traffic on certain days for manifestations, etc., creation of temporary zone for pedestrians, prohibition of truck traffic through the center for a given period of time (weekends, etc.), eventual relocation transit traffic from the center (through bypass or other traffic regulation). 

4.2.2. Improving of traffic infrastructure and signalization 

The action is closely related to other activities in this key goal and intends to increase the level of traffic safety, investing more in the existing traffic infrastructure (signaling, marking, visibility, accessibility for people with disabilities), as well as awareness of current traffic problems. 

4.2.3. Stimulating Bicycle usage and bicycle traffic 
This action consists of several adaptations, or attempts to stimulate the use of bicycles by citizens in urban traffic in all ways, with the aim of reducing the amount of car in the center and promoting a more efficient, environmentally friendly and healthier way of transport. 
The action consists of the following activities: 
-Increasing the number and length of cycling lanes within the city, especially the center, especially in the state road corridor 
-Resolving parking and arranging suitable bicycle parking places in the major public public spaces 
-Considering the possibility of introducing a city bicycle renting system -Promotion of bicycle use through various actions and manifestations 

4.2.4. Car parking system in centre 
The city plans to arrange existing parked places within the city center and consider introducing the city parking system and organization to better regulate traffic, diverting the citizens into the car center and further stimulating an alternative form of transportation -a bicycle. 
4.3. IMPROVING THE ECONOMIC SITUATION OF THE CITY 

As far as the general development strategy of the Town of Petrinja is concerned, this key objective implies all activities related to the revitalization of the city center that would contribute to its economic development and at the same time develops the center of the city making it a better place to live. 
4.3.1. Revitalization of existing inactive buildings in the centre 
In the center of the city there is a major problem of inactive buildings that have not been used and are not owned by the City of Petrinja or conduct legal proceedings related to the proof of ownership. 
The city will seek to stimulate change in this situation by all means so that such buildings will be in the hands of the City or in order to enable the City to use the city or to encourage and enable the use of buildings by existing owners. 

These efforts include discussions and negotiations with state agencies, signing of petitions, greater activity and citizen awareness on this issue, and creating some pressure on the state administration to address such problems. 
Much has been done on this action: within the Beta action ""Urban Parktivity"" citizens have signed a petition for the return of the buildings in question (especially ""Petrinjka"") to the City of Petrinja and also intensified discussions with the competent state property ministry. In that 

4.3.2. Using the cultural heritage for the economic development 
Use of cultural heritage, customs and manifestations, through restaurants, specialized stores and the other in the center of the City to create the perception of the center as a place for work and recreation. Also, intensify the use of cultural content in tourist offer and contribute to linking with the overall development strategy of the City. 
4.3.3. OPG's as model for the city centre development 
OPG (Family Farms) are recognized as an important element in development strategy. ""Green House"", ""Green Market"" projects and other core activities encourage participation and promotion of OPG in the center (linked to the general development strategy of Petrinja as ""the

The French municipality of Nort-sur-Erdre, in Loire-Atlantique, took part of the City Centre Doctor network in 2016. This project aims to revitalize the city centers of small and medium European cities localized near biggest urban areas, which in this case is Nantes. This summary intends to give an overview of the all Integrated Action Plan (IAP) which is the narrative of the all project conducted in Nort-sur-Erdre. 

Nort-sur-Erdre identity card: 
- Inhabitants: 8412 in 2014 

- Part of the Erdre et Gevres Communauté de Communes  

- Geography and transport: Northeast of Nantes with a train connection (35min) to Nantes’city centre. Localized close to the Nantes-Rennes highway (10-15min by car). 

- Landscape: The Erdre River crosses the commune before it joins the Loire in Nantes. It is possible to navigate from Nort-sur-Erdre to the heart of Nantes. Therefore the city is has a port in its city centre. The River also gives an identity to the commune through its landscape. 

- Demography: Nort-sur-Erdre has known a very strong increase the past few decades regarding its population. It is still nowadays an attractive territory: around 30% of the population was not leaving in Nort-sur-Erdre five years ago. Its population is also pretty young with a medium age of 37 years old. 

- Commercial offer: 57 retails in 2013 in Nort-sur-Erdre, 2 supermarkets in the city centre. 

- Historical look: the emblematic building is La Minoterie, built in 1898 and classified historical heritage now. It had multiple purposes and was used by the industry. In 1980 the SNCF closed the railroad until 2014. This had consequences on the development of the city, regarding mobility. 


Visions for the future of Nort-sur-Erdre: 
As we will explain later on, one of the first phases of the project was to address a diagnostic and a place analysis of the city and its centre. The city council chose to build a partnership with the University of Nantes and “hired” a group of students of the Master 2 “Villes et territoires” (Cities and territories) to conduct these diagnostic and place analysis. Among this 
group there were students of geography, architecture, law and urban planning. They produced documents and came up with two visions, or two different scenarios they recommend as development models: 
The city of proximity: mostly based on the promotion of green mobility, strengthen of social links and good commercial offer. 
The Erdre river’s landscapes, parks of the city: it emphasis on the identity of the landscapes of the Erdre river and recommend to play on the notion of city/countryside as a tool in order to attract new inhabitants. 
These visions were then presented by the students during a meeting of the Urban Local Group (ULG) and discussed among the members. A third vision came out, which combines elements of the two visions presented above: a city of proximity with an appease city centre and a better living environment. This vision is the goal that the ULG hopes to achieve by the implementation of this integrated action plan. 


1. Place analysis and identification of the main challenges 


The following table presents the tools, the process and the results of the place analysis and the identification of the main problems. These steps led to the definition of the priorities that the ULG wanted to work on through the project. 


Tool used : Mental maps 
Who :  ULG 
Process/methods : Each ULG member was asked to draw his vision of the city centre in order to delimitate the territory that the project will focus on 
Main results : The ULG concluded that the city centre was included within the city’s entry and exit signs. 

Tool used : Field investigation 
Who : ULG, Students, External expertise cabinet 
Process/methods : ULG members first adapted to the local situation a model of equerry given by URBACT during meetings. ULG also set the objectives of the investigation: 150 answers of a representative panel. The survey was available on the website of the city hall and the students questioned people during two days in the street. The external cabinet compiled all the results. 
Main results : 162 answers, State of the retails: lack of adaptation, gap between offer and demand, forfeiture of the available space, High using of car in the centre, Dangerous place to bicycle.

Tool used : Peer review 
Who : ULG 
Process/methods : Consist in a city walk where participants have to say what they would Start/Stop/Continue/Improve. The ULG was divided in several groups corresponding to a thematic: conviviality and dynamism, living environment, mobility and accessibility.  
Main results :  See SWOT analysis 
 


Tool used : 
SWOT analysis 
Who :  ULG 
Process/methods : Mostly based on the peer review results. The ULG divided itself in small groups to work on the SWOT analysis before compiling all the results 
Main results : Strengths: nice living environment, the port, dynamic local services, supermarkets, geographical situation (near Nantes, Angers and Rennes). Weaknesses: turnover and vacancy among retails, high costs of real estate, high traffic (saturation, dangerous cohabitation between users: bikes, pedestrians...), lack of cleanliness of public spaces, bad signalization. Opportunities: a better promotion of the city, the future deviation road, a better connection between the port and the city centre, local services, the creation of new places of social links and shared spaces, creation of a co working space, the train Threats: the future deviation road and pedestrian zones for the retails, commercial zones, become a dormitory-town. 


 

Priorities identified
 
 
 A. Develop the living environment of Nort-sur-Erdre: Connect the port and the city centre ; Preserve and develop the living environment.  
 B. Appease and question the city centre: Integrate the future deviation road ; Officer the car flows ; Rethink the parking lots et the pathways _ Rethink the retails and the offer of restaurants and bars in the centre.
 C. Create social links: Strengthen intergenerational links ; Create co working spaces.


 


 
2. The action planning process: 
- Establishment of the Urban Local Group (ULG): 


In order to create the group, the city hall mostly relied on identified heads of networks such as the president of the retailers association, teachers at high school, to spread the information. Then the municipality used the first ULG meeting to present the project and to encourage people to invite others. 23 persons assisted to the first ULG meeting, both citizens, elected officials and city hall staff, which was considered as a success. It is also very positive to notice that the members stayed pretty much the same all along the 2 years’ project. The meetings were conducted by Eleo Conseil, an external expert cabinet. 
- Place analysis: 


As explained above, the place analysis was a very important stage conducted both by the ULG and the group of students. This step led to the definition of the priorities and thus the actions the ULG wanted to implement and the objectives the IAP intends to achieve. 


- Ideas people: 


This stage of the project aims to collect the ideas of the citizen regarding the objective of revitalizing the city centre through convivial events. In Nort-sur-Erdre, we used it a little bit differently as we set up the ideas café pretty late in the project timeline. Indeed these events were the occasion to collect global ideas of the inhabitants on the revitalization of the city centre but also to make them think and give their opinion on precise betas actions (such as a theme for a urban fresco). The ULG also used these moments to communicate on the project. 
The first two ideas café were organized during the summer festival “Les Jeudis du port” and were targeted the children with a workshop “draw your city”. The children had the opportunity to draw what is Nort-sur-Erdre in their mind and what they would like to see in the future. It took place during two afternoons and more than 20 drawings were collected. Another ideas café was set up during the Friday’s market, targeting an older public. A stand with coffee and a totem with communication panels presented the project were installed and it mostly was the occasion of presenting the project to the inhabitants. The final ideas café was organized in the high school, we communicate on the project to teenagers, organized a workshop with a class to collect their ideas on the revitalization. It was a big success and more than 60 ideas were collected this day. 
During each event, ULG members came to help setting up the stands, and to talk about the City Centre Doctor project and their personal experience as ULG member. 
- Process to choose which ideas to develop into actions:  


How did the ULG process to select the ideas they wanted to put in actions. It was mostly the resulting of negotiation and discussion during ULG meetings. 
 
- Implementation and thinking of the beta actions: 


 
In order to be more efficient and have a real control on the progress of the beta action, in link with the different stakeholders, the ULG divided itself in small commission, composed by one or several ULG referent. The first step was to divide the ULG members, each member chose a beta action to follow. Then their implication was variable: from a distant implication (just by following the progress by mail and updates), to a direct negotiation with stakeholders. 
Each “commission” was also composed by city hall staff. In any cases, the process of thinking technically on each beta action was at least shared with ULG members and at best carried by them. 
- Participation to the IAP redaction:  


ULG members didn’t directly participate in the redaction of the IAP. Their role was a monitoring of the table of content and drafts during ULG meetings and of final version of the document through working sessions held in the city hall (to be confirmed). 
Role of transnational exchanges in learning: 
 The transnational exchanges and the creation of a transnational network are some of the main achievements of the City Centre Doctor project. The study visits were great opportunities to share visions on common issues and ways of tackle them. The study visits also gave some inspiration to the ULG in terms of betas actions, and some are directly coming from partner cities. 
URBACT method applied in the project: 
The URBACT methods aim to gather civil society and citizens, associations, staff of the city hall, elected officials to work and think on specific actions to implement together. This is a hard method to put into action because it is innovative. In the case of Nort-sur-Erdre we can say it worked well, first because of the diversity of the profiles within the ULG. Then, depending on the betas actions, the ULG succeeded in involving external stakeholders like associations. 
Then, some activities presented in study visit by URBACT experts were re-used during ULG meetings: peer review, exercise on the risk analysis related to setting up of betas actions… It gave us tools to emerge with an action plan. 


3. Focus and objectives for IAP 
Long-term strategic goal or vision for the city centre:  
As said previously, the vision for the future of the city centre is a mix between the two scenarios the students made up: a city of proximity with an appease city centre regarding mobility and an improved living environment. In order to achieve this goal, and after the series of exercises and diagnosis presented above, the ULG defined 3 priorities: 
- appeasing and questioning the city centre 


- to developing the living environment 

- to creating social link 


Description of objectives: 
Once the priorities defined, the ULG divided itself in 3 groups (on per priority) during the 5th ULG meeting, in order to reflect on more specific objectives. The ULG members had to file their ideas in 3 categories: ideas of project mentioned for the first time, ideas of short term projects (6 months), ideas of long term projects (several years). 8 specific objectives came out of these reflections: 
- to restore the function of main square of Champ de Foire; which is a square used on Fridays morning for the market, and punctually for events such as funfairs. The rest of the time it is mostly used as a parking lot. The idea is to restore its function of Main Square by giving the wish to people to hang out on this spot. It goes through creating a new function on the square and improving this environment which is not so green and attractive right now. 

- to open and dynamize the Church Square by giving it back its function of meeting place. This square is the very heart of the city centre, but is not so used as a meeting place right now for several reasons. It is the same problematic as the previous objective. 

- to support and encourage the commercial dynamic;  

- to strengthen the solidarity the social relationships and the living together;  

- to strengthen the cultural and artistic dynamics;

- to strengthen the connections between the port, the river and the city centre by taking advantages of the river;  

- to redefine the shared spaces between bikes, cars and pedestrians in link with the users; 


Some of these specific objectives defined by the ULG also match some of the projects and the strategy the city hall already planned for the development of Nort-sur-Erdre, such as the creation of a multimedia library in 2018, the creation of a co-working space in 2017, the creation of path ways for bikes and pedestrians, the creation of the “house of the port”, the new deviation road… These projects were not imagined within the ULG but they match its objectives and participate to the revitalization of the city centre.

Indicators selected and data to be collected to measure results:  
Ideally the measure of the results will constitute one of the missions of the post-project group. Therefore, the post-project group will have to choose the right indicators to measure the success of the action plan. Since some of the objectives have a subjective character (such 
as beauty) it would be very interesting to make a new survey within the population. Also it is planned to address again in one or two years the first survey we did during the place analysis phase. In this way, the city hall will be capable to compare the answer and to measure the evolution regarding the vision the population has on the city centre. 
4. Actions and time schedule  
 Timeframe for the whole action plan should be presented in a Gantt Chart (to be done). 


5. Resources 
The most important resource regarding the implementation of the betas actions was the people: staff of the different services of the city hall, ULG members, external stakeholders etc. The success of the setting up of some beta actions reside in the gathering of these different actors, as it is shown in the beta action table. The staff of the municipality often brought a technical expertise on the setting up of the beta actions. For example the book-crossing booth was renewed by the building department and firstly supplied in books by the 
library. The department of parks and public spaces furnished tools, raw material and a space to organize the workshops on the construction of the garden boxes… Financially speaking, most of the small amounts dedicated to the setting up of the beta actions were financed on the different budgets of these services. 
The communication department of the city hall was also an important resource for the entire project: it helped us to communicate on the project to the population through the city hall newspaper, through social networks and so on. This department followed entirely the project and helped a lot in its realization. 
Possible funding of the actions: (still have to be defined). 
 
Link of the City Centre Doctor project’s goals with other public policies: 
At national level: The project City Centre Doctor matches a new national program called “Action coeur de ville”, launched in January 2018 which aims to revitalize the city centers of the medium cities. Nort-sur-Erdre is a priory too small to apply to this program but still it shows that the project inserts in national strategies. 
At local council municipality level: there again some aspects of the City Centre Doctor project are matching priorities of the local council municipality (CCEG). For instance a global renovation of the signalization of the territory will take place in 2018. This plan would be able to rely on the beta action on the signalization to promote the use of soft mobility. 

6. Risk analysis 
 This chapter aims to define the potential risks that the action plan may face in the future, after the City Centre Doctor: 
Political changes: this is maybe the bigger risk. In 2020 municipal elections will be organized and the political strategies may change with it. This risk must be tackled by communicate on the project to the population after its end and by keeping a strong and active post-project group. 
Demographic changes: a change in the demography of Nort-sur-Erdre might affect the political strategies and therefore the action plan. Indeed, the action plan is based on the fact that Nort-sur-Erdre is an attractive city which is growing year after year. If this evolution stop or collapse, then maybe it will be necessary to change the perspectives of the action plan. This 
is also where post-project monitoring is important in order to adapt the strategy to the current situation. 
Economic risks: the setting up of an ambitious action plan requires funding; therefore the economic risk might be taken in account. A way to minimize this risk might be to rely on different funding sources from different actors and institutions. 
Disappearing of the ULG resource: there is a risk of a drop out of the project by the ULG members after its end. If a clear structure is not build out before the end of the project with tangible missions to manage and clear objectives the ULG might disappear. The challenge is to give the will to keep on going with a new structure to the members. 
 
7. Monitoring and communication 
The post-project structure still has to be defined within the ULG. Although, some possibilities have been stated, such as the integration of the members of the ULG in an already existent intergenerational citizen group. 
Therefore the schedule of the activities of this new structure has also to be defined in the last stages of the project. But ideas of activities have already emerged in the ULG, in order to evaluate and monitor the action plan: evaluation of the continuous beta actions, field investigation based on the first enquiry of the project and analysis of the compared results and so on. These activities could lead to adjustments of the action plan. 
Communication plan at the end of the project:  
In order to communicate on different levels (local and regional, national and European) on the action plan, and more broadly, on the City Centre Doctor project in Nort-sur-Erdre we planned a communication strategy with the help of the communication department of the city hall. 
Locally, after the end of the project the ULG will hold a stand during an annual fair in the city centre dedicated to the presentation of the action plan and the project. It will be a great occasion to talk about the project during a joyful moment, in the end of April 2018. We will also use the usual tools we used during the entire project: the Facebook page of the project, of the city hall, the local newspaper edited by the municipality and so on. Also, the beta action “rallye citoyen” will be an opportunity to present the project to a youngest audience and the opportunity to come back on the beta actions. The English summary of the 
action plan will be also traduced in French and available on the city hall website. The entire version will be on URBACT website. A printed and designed version will be available within the city hall to the public.

LOCAL ACTION PLAN OF THE 
CITY OF RADLIN 

under the project entitled 
CITY CENTRE DOCTOR 
URBACT III PROGRAMME 



INTRODUCTION
The Local Action Plan is a document describing changes which are planned in the centre of
Radlin, which is understood as the area covering the Radlińskich Olimpijczyków Square,
section of the Mariacka Street from the Square to the Korfantego Street and the Korfantego
Street on the section from the intersection with the Rymera Street to the intersection with
the Rogozina Street.

Changes planned in the centre result from the need of the citizens of Radlin expressed in
interviews conducted in the centre of Radlin during meetings of the Forum of Companies of
the City of Radlin and, first of all, at the meetings of the Local Support Group, which met
over ten times in the Radlin Town Hall. To sum up, these meetings, surveys and discussions,
as well as a diagnosis made by employees of the Town Hall - the following image of the
centre of Radlin emerged:
- The Centre of Radlin (the Korfantego Street) is of commercial nature, i.e. the
citizens and visitors use it mainly for service-related purposes (post office, offices,exchange offices, banks, hairdresser's), as well as to do shopping in small or large
stores, as well as at the marketplace. There is also a church.
- The City Centre is ""cut in half"" by a district road, which determines the transit
function of the heart of the city. This in turn is uncomfortable for citizens who are
struggling with noise, smog, very high traffic and insecurity when it comes to
cycling or walking when crossing the Korfantego Street.
- The City Centre is difficult to access by elderly and disabled persons, as there are
High stairs and quite dark walkways from the side of the housing estate at the
Kwiatowa Street,
- The centre has no storied or underground car park to reduce parking along the
Korfantego Street, which would provide more space for pedestrians and cyclists.
- The centre of the city is unattractive in terms of colour - facades of stores are in
different colours, sometimes neglected. This gives the impression of the lack of
climate and style which would encourage people to visits the centre not only for
commercial purposes.
- Radlińskich Olimpijczyków Square is empty, since, apart from a fountain working in
the summer, there is no infrastructure here, e.g. for children and elderly people,
so that they could spend their time there. Although there are benches, they all
stand in sun-filled places which discourages the citizens to use the Square.
The presented diagnosis of the centre contains a true reflection of the situation in the
centre, which, however, does not look so bad. This is due to the fact that a very high number
of the citizens of Radlin uses the centre, so it is enough to give them at the Korfantego
Street, e.g. more trees and greenery, paint facades of stores in one specific colour, design
new bicycle routes, on the Radlińskich Olimpijczyków Square build, e.g. a children's
playground, new places for rest with a roof, cafe or rearranged greenery, so that they begin
to perceive the centre as an attractive place for spending their free time.
A diagnosis, as well as actions that are worth taking in the centre, were widely discussed at
the meetings of the Local Support Group, and the members of this group are authors of
particular ideas and solutions which may be applied in the centre of Radlin in the years to
come. It is worth mentioning that LSG consists of students of Radlin's schools, nongovernmental
organisations, employees of various institutions (culture, OPS), small
companies and large plants that operate in the city. We agreed together the proposals of
specific actions that are worth implementing in the centre of Radlin, to give the centre back
to the Citizens.
The next matter worth pointing out are that should a higher number of the citizens use the
centre for recreational purposes, to spend their free time, then commercial turnover of local
entrepreneurs would probably increase and new services would develop. Therefore, the
purpose of the project would be fulfilled, namely making such changes in the city centre that
will revitalise entrepreneurship and contribute to an increased number of jobs in the centre.
It is worth adding that a detailed description of the diagnosis of the centre of Radlin
(answers of the citizens, the results of observations), plan of actions aimed at recovery of the city centre, strategic goals, schedule of actions, analysis of resources and risk, monitoring
and evaluation can be found in the further part of the document.

1. ANALYSIS OF THE CITY CENTRE
1.1. HISTORICAL CONTEXT
Radlin is a city located in the Silesian Province. It given a town charter on the basis of the
Regulation of the Council of Ministers of 11 August 1954. Villages which were so far
separate, yet located close to one another: Biertułtowy, Radlin Dolny, Radlin Górny, Obszary,
Wypandów and Głożyny - were integrated into a compact Radlin Commune with an
administrative centre in Biertułtowy. The 1950s,1960s and 70s, are a period of development
of the city, mainly as a result of non-productive mine operations.
The administrative reform of 1975 led to incorporation of Radlin, Pszów, Rydułtowy and
Marklowice to Wodzisław Śląski. The Radlin District occupied at that time 25% of the area of
Wodzisław Śląski.
On 1 January 1997, as a result of a referendum, Radlin once again became the city. It
consists of former towns: Biertułtowy, Głożyny and Obszary. Radlin Górny and Radlin Dolny -
once parts of Radlin - are nowadays districts of Wodzisław Śląski. The city borders Rydułtowy
and Rybnik to the north, Pszów to the west, Marklowice to the east on, and Wodzisław Śląski
to the south. Radlin, as a self-governing city, quickly adopted a number of investments
improving both an image and functioning of the city. Property of the city include KWK
Marcel Cultural Centre, public library and Sport Centre, soon transformed into the Municipal
Centre of Culture and Sports, and later into separate institutions: Municipal Cultural Centre
(MOK), City Sports and Leisure Centre (MOSiR) and the Public Library (MBP). These
institutions soon underwent a complete overhaul. The renewed cultural centre hosts
national and foreign artists, while MOSiR is where competitions in various scientific
disciplines are held. Independence of Radlin stimulated also the activity of many people to
become involved in the city's affairs.
The contemporary City of Radlin covers a total surface area of 12.53 km2, right at the
National Road no. 78 Gliwice-Bohumin (CZ) and the railway route Katowice-Chałupki. The
city centre consists of the areas of the former Biertułtowy Commune and a strongly
urbanised and industrial area around KWK Marcel (hard coal mine), with a historic 19thcentury
housing estate-gardens build in early classic modernism style (Emma Colony in
Radlin).
The main employers within the city are large industrial plants, ""Marcel"" Hard Coal Mine,
""Radlin"" Coking Plant and ""Marcel"" Heat and Power Station.

1.2. DEMOGRAPHICS
Radlin occupies 12.53 km2 and is one of nine communes of the Wodzisław District. In
respect of the area, Radlin occupies only 4.4% of the district and 0.1% of the Silesian
Province. Population density is presented below: 1 km2 is inhabited, on average, by 1,439
people, which is ca. 2.5 times higher than the population density in the Wodzisław District
and ca. 3.5 times higher than the same value for the Silesian Province2.
From among the total population, permanently residing Radlin in 2015, amounting to
17,913, there were 9,231 women, and 8,682 men. One can note a large decrease in the
number of the inhabitants of the city as compared to the previous years. And so, in 2002
Radlin was inhabited by 18,532 citizens, whereas in 2012 by 18,146. One may also observe
the numerical superiority of women over men (women constitute 51.5% of the whole
population of the city).

Radlin is a population of ageing demographics, where the number of people in the preworking
age only slightly exceeds the number of population in the post-working age. Not
very favourable tendency is becoming even more visible, if we compare data from a
diagnosis of social problems of 2002, where this ratio was 4168 to 2695.
In total, pre-production and post-production age categories account for less than 37% of all
the citizens, which is hardly safe, especially if we consider tendencies on the labour market,
threatening the city, as well as the Wodzisław District and the entire province. From the
demographic point of view, one can consider that it is a type of the ageing population, with
the intensification of this trend.
Radlin has a negative population growth amounting to -17. It corresponds to the natural
growth of -0,9 per 1,000 inhabitants. 181 children were born in 2015, from which 54% were
boys and 46% girls. Average weight of a new-born is 3,327 grams. Demographic dynamics
rate, namely a relation of the number of live births to the number of deaths is 0.9 and is
higher than the average for the Silesian province (0.83) and lower than the rate for the
country (0.94).

In 2015, 225 registrations were recorded in Radlin for internal movement and 237
deregistrations, which resulted in internal migration balance amounting to -12.

In 2015 division into biological age groups in Radlin was as follows: 69.1% of inhabitants of
Radlin were ""adults"" (15-64 years), 15.5% were ""children"" (0-14 years) and 15.4% were
""seniors"" (65 and more).

In 2015 division into production age groups in Radlin was as follows: 62.7% - working age
population, i.e. 18-64 years (including 58.2% women, 62.7% men), 18.8% - post-working age
population, i.e. 65 + and 18.5% - pre-working age population, i.e. less than 18 years old.

Radlin consists of five registry precincts (informal districts), which include: Marcel, Obszary,
Biertułtowy, Głożyny and Reden.
The largest clusters of inhabitants can be found in Biertułtowy (mainly Sienkiewicza,
Damrota, Findera, Ściegiennego, Kwiatowa and Rogozina streets), then in Głożyny (mainly
Rymera and Głożyńska, Kominka, Wrzosowa streets) and in Marcel (mainly Wieczorka, Mielęckiego, Solskiego streets or streets Korfantego and Mariacka streets which are located
to a considerable extent in the Marcel district).
At the end of December 2014 the Silesian Province, as compared with other provinces, has
one of the lowest unemployment rates (9.6%), the highest number of job offers submitted
to district employment agencies, as well as the lowest number of the registered unemployed
per 1 employment offer. As at 31 December 2014, 550 people were registered in the District
Employment Agency in Radlin (ca. 3% of the inhabitants and ca. 5% of working age
population), of which 351 were women. The problem continues to increase, when one takes
into consideration that 280 of those persons are long-term unemployed, including 205
women, and 155 have no professional experience. In this regard, the Radlin Commune is
ranked fourth in the Wodzisław District. A percentage increase of unemployed women as
compared to previous years is to be noticed. Currently women constitute ca. 64% of the
unemployed, whereas in 2002 they were 57% (with the unemployment rate of 15.1%.). One
can say that men fare better with growing unemployment than women.
The problem of unemployment corresponds directly to the level of education of inhabitants
of Radlin. 57% of the unemployed have basic vocational education or lower. Statistical data
demonstrate also that the labour market is not particularly interested in persons having
post-secondary or secondary vocational education.
4,404 of inhabitants of Radlin are potential pupils/students (3-24 years) - including 2,209
women and 2,194 men. According to the National Census of 2011, 12,7% of the population
has higher education, 2.5 % post-secondary education, 9.9% general secondary education,
and 16.8% secondary vocational education. 33.6% of the inhabitants of Radlin have
vocational education, 5.2% junior secondary education and 18.7% primary education. 0.6%
of the inhabitants ended their education before finishing the primary school. The inhabitants
of Radlin are less educated as compared to the entire Silesian Province. Among women living
in Radlin the largest percentage has vocational education (25.6%), and primary education
(23.7%). Men most often have vocational education (42.1%), and secondary vocational
education (19.4%). 19.8% of the inhabitants of Radlin being potential pupils/students (3-24
years) are aged 3-6 - pre-school education (19.6% of them are girls and 20.1% are boys). 656
per 1,000 children in pre-school age attend institutions of kindergarten education. There is
1.59 child in pre-school age per one place in the institution of kindergarten education. In the
group aged 3-24, 24.0% of the population attends primary schools (7-12 years) (23.4% of
them are girls and 24.7% are boys). There are 21 pupils per 1 class in primary schools. The
gross schooling rate (relation of all persons learning in primary schools to persons aged 7-12
years) is 98.05. Among the inhabitants being potential pupils/students 12.0% are aged 13-15
years - junior secondary education (11.2% of them are girls and 12.7% are boys). There is 25
pupils per 1 class in junior secondary schools. The gross schooling rate (relation of all
persons learning in junior secondary schools to persons aged 13-15 years) is 110.65.

In the group aged 3-24 17.4% of the inhabitants attends secondary schools (16-18 years)
(17.7% are girls and 17.0% are boys). There is 0 students per 1 class at secondary schools.
There are 26 students per class in basic vocational schools. There are 25 pupils per class in
secondary vocational and art schools. The tertiary education age group (19-24 years) include
26.8% of the inhabitants of Radlin being potential students (28.1% women and 25.5% men).
The following educational institutions operate in the city:
· 3 kindergartens,
· 4 primary schools
· the After-School Activity Centre
· the ""Koliba"" Community Centre.
Number of educational institutions is extremely important, owing to a large impact
education has on the standard of living. In addition, educational operations activate the
inhabitants, organise their free time, as well as support development of children and
teenagers through implementation of prophylactic programmes.
1.3. CENTRE OF THE CITY OF RADLIN AS COMPARED TO OTHER PARTICIPANTS OF THE
PROJECT
The area covered by the impact of the project is the strict centre of Radlin, i.e. the

1.4. IDENTIFICATION OF MAIN PROBLEMS
According to the conducted surveys the centre of Radlin is a place visited by the inhabitants
of the city mainly for the purpose of making use of services offered in this area. People like
to shop in small stores, they go to: banks, florist's, the market, hairdresser's, restaurants.
Moreover, the inhabitants of Radlin visit the centre of the city quite often - they walk and
shop there, so there is a need to use the centre, however, observations prove that the
centre of Radlin have large shortages with regard to service offer which does not make it a
place where one wants to spend their free time.
According to the opinion of the inhabitants, they prefer spending their free time in other
places, also outside the city borders. The main reasons for this include:
- very large vehicle traffic on the main street of the city, i.e. the Korfantego Street,
- lack of parking places,
- no bicycle paths (according to the conducted surveys people do not feel safe when cycling
or crossing the street),
- no cafes and pubs,
- no cinema,
- too few trees providing shade on the Radlińskich Olimpijczyków Square,
- no municipal park,
- bad air quality (mostly in the autumn-winter period).
Main problems were identified using the below methods, i.e. SWOT analysis and a problem
tree:

Strengths
1. There are people in the city centre
2. Good access to the centre
3. Benches and greenery
4. Fountain
5. Large square where changes can be made
6. Pro-ecological policy of the city, e.g. insect hotels
7. Entrepreneurs running activities in the centre of
the city want the planned changes
8. Close distance to the graduation tower and a
municipal park in Reden (to be developed)


Weaknesses
1. High vehicle traffic in the city centre
2. Missing car parks
3. No shade on the Radlińskich Olimpijczyków Square
4. Bad air quality
5. No cinema
6. No outdoor pool
7. No cafes and pubs
8. No playground on the Radlińskich Olimpijczyków
Square
9. No cycle paths
10.No ice rink
11. People do not use the centre for leisure purposes
12. The centre of the city is not homogeneous (too many
colours and advertisements)

Opportunities 
1. More jobs in Radlin
2. Better earnings for persons running their own
business in the centre
3. Reduction in traffic
4. New parking places apart from the strict centre
5. New bicycle routes connecting Radlin with the
neighbouring cities
6. Safe connection of the Radlińskich Olimpijczyków
Square with the Korfantego Street (woonerf at the
Mariacka Street)
7. Connection of the centre with the planned park in
Reden

Threats
1. Closure of the ""Marcel"" mine
2. The Korfantego Street is a district road (the city may

3. No funds for planned changes


The main problems can also be presented in a graphic form (problem tree):

INSECURITY DURING CYCLING
NO PEOPLE ON THE OLIMPIAN SQUARE
CARS EVERYWHERE
PEOPLE LOOK FOR JOBS IN OTHER CITIES
ENTERPRENEURS CLOSE THEIR BUISINESSES
IN THE HEATING PERIOD PEOPLE SPEND THEIR TIME AT HOME
SEASONAL BUISINESS IN THE CENTRES, E.G. BEER GARDENS, DOES NOT PAY OFF
PEOPLE SPEND THEIR FREE TIME IN OTHER CITIES

MAIN PROBLEM: TOO FEW PEOPLE WANT TO SPEND THEIR FREE TIME IN THE CENTRE OF RADLIN

1.5. TOOLS USED TO IDENTIFY PROBLEMS
Main problems present in the centre of Radlin were identified with the use of the following
tools:
- a survey entitled ""Perception of the centre of the city"" (a questionnaire had a paper form
and was available on the website: https://miasto.radlin.pl/badamy-postrzeganie-centrumradlina/,
- interviews with persons conducting business activities in the centre of Radlin,
- direct (external) observation of the city centre,
- consultation meetings with the Local Support Group and the inhabitants interested in
changes that must be made in the city - different methods of acquiring information were
used at the meetings, e.g. group interview, workshops,
- SWOT analysis,
- a problem tree method.
By using the above problem identification tools one tried to achieve a participatory approach
to development of urban space. They emphasised the role of an active user of the space,
who, in line with the City Centre Doctor project, becomes its co-author. Such an approach
aims at development of strong partnerships between public institutions, private sector and
inhabitants.
1.6. LOCAL SUPPORT GROUP
The Local Support Group - URBACT - has been operating in Radlin since December 2015 and
consists of representatives of:
- local government,
- Radlin Town Hall,
- municipal organisational units (the Cultural Centre, the Municipal Sport and Leisure Centre,
the Social Aid Centre),
- NGOs (Active Women Association, Radling Cultural Association, Radlin Youth Association,
EDUARTE Association),
- entrepreneurs (Forum of Companies in Radlin, Employment Centre),
- students of secondary schools in Radlin.
Such a structure of LGW in the city of Radlin ensures that each local community is
represented. The purpose of this group was to ensure that results of international exchange
of practices between partner cities of the project are used in such a way as to have the
maximum effect. The group established in Radlin guarantees that ideas originating under the
project are realistic and feasible at the local level. The members transfer the most important
information about the project to a broader circle of recipients, mobilise stakeholders, define
needs and, what is most important, help in preparation of the Local Action Plan.

It should be emphasised that it was assumed that the group would be open from the
beginning of the project, i.e. that it would be possible to adopt the structure of LGW should
the process advance. Depending on the needs, the open membership allowed new
stakeholders to intervene with regard to specific issues or to join group activities at any time
during the project (e.g. the group invited all entrepreneurs running their business at the
Korfantego Street to one of the meetings of the group, concerning trade on that street).
2. THE PROCESS OF PLANNING ACTIONS AIMING AT RECOVERY OF THE CITY CENTRE
2.1. ACTIONS OF THE LOCAL SUPPORT GROUP
The Local Support Group carried out its activities on periodically organised meetings, took
active participation in activities scheduled for implementation under the project, and its
representatives participated in international exchange during the study visits in all the
partner cities of the project. In the course of implementation of the project the Local
Support Group met 12 times.
Actions of the Local Support Group became a development platform for a new format of
communication and cooperation between the city and its members (especially NGOs and
youth) based on an open debate and common initiatives.
Activities the Local Support Group were devoted to selection of the range of problems of the
Local Action Plan for Radlin, determination of stakeholders and presentation of available
research findings with regard to problems and situation of the centre of the city. Materials
for meetings of partners of City Centre Doctor project were jointly prepared. The project
coordinator presented effects and results of meetings every time. During the discussion over
LPD priority areas for action were selected, as well as main goals which to be achieved by
Radlin under the project. Then specific actions and monitoring indicators were selected. In
order to verify the present situation and determine target values of the indicators research
concerning situation of the centre of the city was conducted (City Centre Analysis). After
familiarising itself with the results, the Local Support Group selected actions to be
implemented under the project and determined assumed results.

2.2. THE ROLE OF INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGE DURING PLANNING OF ACTIONS
International meetings, as a basic action in City Centre Doctor project, were a forum for
development of a value added by exchanging knowledge and practices between 10 partners
of the project.
This exchange ensured double-sided communication between the local and the international
level. Knowledge and experience acquired during international meetings undoubtedly
improved a discussion at the local level, gave a possibility for first-hand experience of
innovations introduced by the project partners in their cities and then, following their
example, for introduction of similar changes and investments in our city. Experiences of
others and possibility to get to know the method of their implementation inspired used to
undertake activities in our city, improved the potential of an integrated strategy and lead for
development of a better Local Action Plan.
In Radlin we adopted a principle, which allowed us to ensure transfer of knowledge acquired
during meetings, consisting in the fact that after the international meetings, the meeting of
the Local Support Group was held in order to discuss them, and think about processes and
results, then specify those that may be integrated with our Action Plan. Each participant had
the possibility to discuss his/her impressions and findings.
Below there are examples of improvements introduced in the partner cities of City Centre
Doctor, which may be successfully implemented in Radlin.

An example of using the facade of the building of the Regional Chamber for bee-keeping (Idrija - Slovenia).
“Green tunnel” (Heerlen – Netherlands).
Use of colour backlight (Heerlen - Netherlands).

2.3. IDEAS FOR ACTIVITIES IN THE CITY CENTRE
In the course of the meetings and consultations the participants presented numerous ways
of revitalising the city centre, increasing its attractiveness, and hence attracting more
people. It should be emphasised that all the inhabitants of the city were invited to join the
discussion concerning the city centre (electronic survey), and the Local Support Group is
composed of representatives of various organisations, whose age ranged from 15 to over 70,
therefore ideas for changes in the centre of the city and undertaken actions cover different
issues and are very broad.

Below there are ideas for changing the city centre of Radlin collected in the course of
implementation of City Centre Doctor project:
1. The Korfantego Street
- reduction in or ban on driving cars in the city centre and introduction of solutions such as a
promenade, a woonerf or traffic calming,
- construction of a public park with trees, benches, playgrounds,
- construction of bicycle paths,
- construction of a car park beyond the city centre,
- introduction of fees for parking in the centre (e.g. 30 minutes for free, a fee for longer
parking),
- opening of new cafes and pubs in the city centre,
- modernisation of the market,
- unification of colours of buildings in the city centre and ban on advertisements,
- modernisation of housing estate access ways,
- ""green tunnel"" over the street
- elimination of architectonic barriers for the disabled, parents with pushchairs,
- organisation of small thematic events, e.g. retro, cooking, the neighbour's day, breakfast on
the grass.
2. The Radlińskich Olimpijczyków Square
- opening of seasonal dining facilities, e.g. beer gardens,
- construction of roofing or roofed arbours with the place to seat, all covered with
vegetation,
- playground used as a rink in the winter,
- stalls,
- separation of the Square from the roadway by a greenery strip,
- purchase of a new infrastructure, e.g. chess tables, boards for presenting photographs,
benches for conducting, e.g. outdoor classes,
- open-air cinema,
- carol singing in the Christmas period,
- reduced rental payments,
- highlighted RADLIN inscription,
- in the summer, a playfield used to play, e.g. for beach volleyball.

2.4. BETA ACTONS IMPLEMENTED DURING THE PROJECT
Throughout the duration of the project two types of beta actions were implemented - shortterm
and long-term. One was the organisation of short events called ""The breakfast on the
grass"", while the second one, covering the entire summer season, was establishment of a
sandy playfield in the centre of the Radlińskich Olimpijczyków Square - the so-called Radlin's
beach - allowing people to play, e.g. beach volleyball.
A short-term action named ""The breakfast on the grass"" was organised on 22 June 2017, The
purpose of the action was to prove the inhabitants of the city that at low cost (artificial
grass, pallet furniture, snacks) one can change an unused space into an attractive place to
walk, rest and have fun. Use of artificial grass in the action was not a coincidence - the
purpose was to emphasise the need to change the concrete centre of the city into a one
more friendly for everyone - green and encouraging to spend time actively. This action was
joined by members of the Local Support Group, i.e.. representatives of non-governmental
organisations (Radlin's Youth Association), teenagers from local schools, local councillors and
entrepreneurs (Bar na winklu). The breakfast on the grass was positively received by the
inhabitants of Radlin, who gladly joined the meeting and took an active part in it. A form of
action turned out to be so attractive that it was decided that the event of this type will be
one of the annual events organised in the city centre.

A long-term action named Radlin's beach covered the entire summer period. A sand court
was open to all the inhabitants for free. The initiative was intended to provide the
inhabitants with various forms of recreation and rest, and its location emphasised that the
Radlińskich Olimpijczyków Square is a perfect place to meet and relax. The beach was open
to the citizens throughout the entire summer season, and there were no open hours, which
was supposed to induce them to spontaneously visit the place that they usually pass by. The
form of the beach did not limit this investment only to the playing field - the place was used in accordance with the current need as a playfield, a great sandpit for the youngest or a
resting place for teenagers. Near the beach a water curtain was placed, which would allow
people to cool on hot days and was an additional attraction attracting people to visit the
Radlińskich Olimpijczyków Square.

2.5. ANALYSIS OF ACTIONS PLANNED IN THE CONTEXT OF THE ASSUMED OBJECTIVES
To achieve the main strategic objective of the Local Action Plan, i.e. increase in the number
of inhabitants using the city centre for the purpose of recreation, the Department of
Development and External Funds of the Radlin Town Hall, along with the Local Support
Group, developed a detailed action plan, which presents as follows:
1) Preparation of graphic visualisation of the Radlińskich Olimpijczyków Square,
the Mariacka Street on the section from the Municipal Cultural Centre to the
Korfantego Street and the Korfantego Street, on the section from the
intersection with The Rymera Street to the intersection with the Rogozina
Street. The visualisation contains proposals and comments of the inhabitants of
Radlin collected in the form of paper and electronic surveys, interviews,
meetings and workshops at schools, meeting of the Local Support Group - 2018
2) Social consultations concerning the visualisation with regard to meeting
expectations of the inhabitants of the City, in particular users of the centre -

with the Rymera Street to the intersection with the Rogozina Street - 2021
3. GOALS
3.1. EXPLANATION OF THE SELECTION OF OBJECTIVES
Definition of strategic goals was preceded by a diagnosis of the city centre of Radlin
prepared by the members of the Local Support Group by observing the city centre at
different times of the day, as well as using surveys. The purpose of the survey was to identify
the opinion of different groups of users of the strict centre of Radlin concerning, among
others, the appearance of the centre of Radlin, its functions, types of provided services,
purposes for which it is used by the inhabitants, sense of safety, hours in which the
inhabitants spend their free time here. Questions were asked to people using and visiting
the city centre, as well as to those living and working there. Additionally, questions were
asked to students of Radlin's schools and the Internet users. 267 answers were received,
including 106 paper surveys and 161 web surveys. The City of Radlin did not receive such a
number of answers within 12 days in any survey organised so far. Moreover, during
meetings of the Local Support Group of CityCentreDoctor project, its members repeatedly
indicated what is cool about the city centre, what should be improved and what should be
changed.
All answers and conclusions from the meetings paints the following picture of the city centre
of Radlin. On the one hand, the city centre is used by the inhabitants. People like to shop in
small stores, they go to: banks, flower shops, hairdresser's services, exchange office,
hamburger stalls, bus stops, post office, restaurant, bakery, supermarket. In addition, the
inhabitants of Radlin visit the city centre quite often - they walk and shop, thus they fell the need to use the centre. One fourth of the respondents uses the centre every day, and half of
them is in the centre two times a week. This is a very important, positive indicator. There are
no large differences in using the city centre in the summer period and outside the season.
The citizens feel safe in the centre. Many people need only 10 minutes to get to the centre.
Most of the surveyed visit the city centre to use postal services, official services and medical
care. Some people declare that they use services for teenagers, public transport and leisure
services. Activities the respondents like to take in the city centre include: shopping, spending
free time, working, conducting business operations. The respondents indicated the city
centre as the best place to run business operations.
On the other hand, the majority indicated other cities near Radlin as the best place to find a
job. According to three fourths of the surveyed, opening hours of places offering
recreational services are, on average, satisfactory or unsatisfactory. Also the most answers
indicate other cities as the best places to do shopping - Rybnik, Katowice, Cracow. A place,
which is the best for spending free time is located not only outside the city centre, but also
outside Radlin - it is a different city. People do not feel safe when cycling or crossing the
street. The most important challenge in the city centre is to limit the vehicle traffic and limit
the speed to 20 km/h. Other challenges indicated by the respondents are: closing the city
centre for vehicles, construction of: bicycle paths, new parking places, new jobs, repair of
roads, reducing low emission, modernisation of the market, construction of speed limiters.
The respondents confirmed that the most the things they miss most in the centre include:
cafe, car park, open-air cinema, shopping mall, as well as tourist information, municipal park,
bicycle paths, green areas, playgrounds, disco, place for mothers with children, pharmacy. 

3.2. STRATEGIC GOALS - THEMATIC SCOPE AND DESCRIPTION
Selection of strategic goals results directly from the needs indicated by the inhabitants, as
well as observations conducted in the centre of Radlin. Additionally, the answers took into
account votes of entrepreneurs who run business operations in the city centre, as well as
conclusions of the meetings of the Local Support Group.
The primary strategic goal of the Local Action Plan for Radlin is to increase the number of
inhabitants using the city centre for recreational purposes.
The main objective will be achieved by implementation of 3 operational goals:
1) Reconstruction of public space within the Radlińskich Olimpijczyków Square,
2) Reconstruction of public space in the city centre at The Mariacka Street from the
Radlińskich Olimpijczyków Square to The Korfantego Street (""woonerf""),
3) Reconstruction of public space in the centre at the Korfantego Street (on section: from
the intersection with Rymera Street to the intersection with The Rogozina Street).
Reconstruction of the centre of Radlin, understood as revitalization of the urban space and
its provision to its inhabitants in the aforementioned scope, will begin from the Radlińskich
Olimpijczyków Square. According to opinions of the inhabitants it will be a shaded space
with new places to seat, with two playgrounds with references to the graduation tower and
the mine. Additionally, a sandbox, small architecture elements and modern greenery will be
located on the Square. A completely new arrangement of the Square is supposed to provide a new visual appearance and functions, as a result of which it will be an attractive space for
the inhabitants, where they will spend their time. The plans include rental of the part of the
space on the Square for cafe selling ice creams and beverages. A consideration is given to
relocation of the market to the Square from the Korfantego Street.
Then the section of the Mariacka Street will be converted into a ""woonerf"". A woonerf in
Radlin will be a type of street in the urbanised area, where an emphasis will be put on a high
level of security, traffic calming and high aesthetic qualities, with maintenance of parking
places and communication functions with a priority for pedestrians and cyclists. According to
the assumption the woonerf will be a public space combining functions of a street,
promenade, car park and a meeting place for the inhabitants. The basis for the design of this
street will be resignation from the traditional division of space between the roadway and
sidewalks and the application of small architecture elements, which discourages transit
traffic, without excluding a possibility to introduce public transport.


3.3. INDICATORS AND THE WAY THEY ARE MEASURED
The implementation of the main objective will affect the fulfilment of 3 strategic result
indicators:
1) Increase in the number of services in the centre,
2) Increase in the number of micro- and small enterprises operating in the centre,
3) Increase in income of micro- and small enterprises operating in the city centre.
Description of the way of measurement of indicators
Indicators will be measured by:
- Observation of the city centre of Radlin,
- Surveys of the inhabitants using services available in the centre of Radlin,
- Surveys of entrepreneurs providing services in the centre of Radlin,
- Photo documentation.
Frequency of measurement of indicators
Indicators will be measured twice a year and then their results will be compared with the
previous measurements.

3.4. PLANNED RESULTS
Cities are founded and developed due to functions they perform. Municipal functions
include the following functions: commercial, industrial, construction, transport, financial,
cultural, administrative. The biggest part of the area of cities is occupied by the residential
function. The city of Radlin is a mining centre, thereby it performs industrial, transport and
residential functions.
Contrary to a stereotypical image of Radlin as an industrial city, we have tried to give it a
new image and functions for years. As a result, with a financial support from the EU funds, a
saline graduation tower was built (the first in Silesia), due to which the city of Radlin started
to perform recreational and health functions. Currently, bicycle paths are built in the city
and revitalization of the urban space in the centre is planned, so that it is more friendly for
the inhabitants.
For this reason, a main result of the implementation of the Local Action Plan will be a
beautiful, modern and functional urban space, which will encourage the inhabitants to go
out and come to the centre. Not only to handle a specific case or to do shopping, but also to
spend their free time in the centre, meet with other inhabitants of the city and to discover
that the place which was so far empty and poorly arranged has a new visual appearance. The
new concept of arrangement of the space within the centre combines the Radlińskich
Olimpijczyków Square, through the Mariacka Street, with the Korfantego Street, creating a
modern, functional space with limited vehicle traffic.
A larger number of people visiting the centre should contribute to an increase in turnover of
companies, whose activities are focused around the Korfantego Street and the Radlińskich
Olimpijczyków Square.


3.5 CORRELATION BETWEEN STRATEGIC GOALS OF THE LOCAL ACTION PLAN AND OTHER
STRATEGIES OF THE CITIES

5. RESOURCES AND SOURCES OF FINANCING

5.1. HUMAN RESORCES

The entity responsible for achievement of objectives of the plan is the Mayor of Radlin.
Implementation of the Local Development Plan in Radlin will be based on the ""workgroup""
model. In this model management actions are performed by employees of the Municipal
Office. Coordination of the whole process and management of investment projects and
implementation of the instruments are divided between the operational coordinator and a
unit responsible for implementation of objectives assumed in the plan.
The Local Development Plan Operating Coordinator - a person within the structure of the
Municipal Office, playing a central role in the management and implementation of the
programme, responsible for coordination and integration of operations of other cells/units
with regard to implementation of the Local Development Plan in Radlin. The Coordinator
manages the cell responsible for implementation of the Local Development Plan (the
Department of Development and External Funds). Tasks of the operational coordinator will
include, in particular:
- monitoring of the Programme and assessment of the degree of its implementation;
- preparation of reports from implementation of the action;
- supervision over projects included in the document;
- information-promotion activities, receiving comments and applications from the
inhabitants, as well as reporting of own original ideas;
- preparation of the final report from implementation of the Programme.
The Local Support Group established under implementation of City Centre Doctor project
will also participate in the process of implementation of the Local Action Plan. Its members
will meet periodically in order to assess reports from implementation of the action (once a
year), as well as on an ad hoc basis, should there be a need to make changes in the
programme related to a change in the term of implementation of the adopted goals or a
change consisting in adding new objectives or extension/limitation of objectives to be
implemented under the adopted Local Action Plan.

5.2. FINANCING

By funding of the Local Action Plan one should understand funding of all projects and
undertakings planned for implementation within the area covered by the Plan.
Implementation of tasks specified in the Local Action Plan requires substantial financial
outlays and cooperation between different entities. Depending on the type of design and he beneficiary (contractor), sources for funding the action or the project will be different.
The beneficiary, on the other hand, as a principle, is the owner of the property covered by
the project action. It was him who will have competence and, to some extent, independence
in acquisition, use and settlement of funds for implementation of the project.
The main, potential sources of financing of actions under the Local Action Plan include, first
of all:
- public sources - domestic:
· budget of the commune (own funds)
· governmental programmes and special purpose vehicles, among others, the National
Fund for Environmental Protection and Water Management,
· programmes and provincial funds, among others, Provincial Fund for Environmental
Protection and Water Management.
- public sources - foreign:
· European funds, including: The European Development Regional Fund, the European
Social Fund, e.g.: The Regional Operational Programme of the Silesian Province for the
years 2014-2020,
· other foreign funds.
- private measures:
· from the financial market: credits and loans, leasing, issue of municipal bonds, bank
guarantees,
· own funds of private investors,
· measures of non-governmental organisations,
· own funds of inhabitants.

5.3. ACTIONS

The Local Action Plan is based on the principle of partnership and participation. The main
goal of actions related to socialisation of the process is reaching the widest possible group of
beneficiaries and stakeholders, institutions that may be partners in projects under the
programme, but also encouraging inhabitants to undertake initiatives used to implement
objectives adopted in it.
The principle of partnership and participation of the local community in implementation of
the Local Action Plan will proceed in two ways:
- indirectly - informing,
- directly - interactively.

Information will be published indirectly in the local press, on the website of the city, in
promotional and information materials and brochures.
The Local Action Plan will be presented directly during meetings with the inhabitants,
representatives of local environments, non-governmental organisations. Main partners, in
respect of which communication and information policy under the Local Development Plan
will be conducted, will be: inhabitants of the city, including also specific social groups, such
as seniors or teenagers, non-governmental organisations and social and business entities
conducting operations within the area covered by revitalisation, owners and administrators
of real estate in the area covered by the Local Action Plan.
Under promotion of the Local Action Plan the following actions will be taken:
- publications of the Local Action Plan on the website of the Municipal Office,
- adding information about tasks newly implemented under the Local Development Plan on
the website of the Municipal Office,
- cooperation with local press aiming at informing the public about the course of
implementation and monitoring of the Local Action Plan.
Ways of initiating cooperation between the public sector, private sector and nongovernmental
organisations:
- preparation of current information from the course of implementation of the Local Action
Plan,
- preparation and implementation of web surveys addressed to inhabitants and other
stakeholders, concerning assessment of the Local Action Plan,
- organisation of common meetings (debates) of the three sectors in the course of which it
will be possible to determine proposals for new tasks to be introduced to the Local Action
Plan,
- continuous cooperation and obligation of members of the Local Support Group to
propagating the ideas set forth in the Local Action Plan among the local community.
Such large-scale actions will ensure popularisation and publication of this document, and
hence achievement of public acceptance for its implementation, by preventing potential
conflicts of interests.

6. RISK ANALYSIS

The purpose of the risk analysis is to identify actions that will reduce or eliminate the
adverse effect the risk has on the process of implementation of the programme. As a result,
it is possible to identify, assess and monitor the risk level in a qualitative and quantitative
manner.


7. MONITORING AND EVALUATION
7.1. MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE AND MONITORING
The monitoring process is an internal project management mechanism. It was prepared to
test compliance of implementation of the Local Action Plan with the schedule and financial
assumptions.
Management and direct supervision over implementation of the Local Action Plan will be
exercised by the Department of Development and External Funds of the Town Hall in Radlin.
It will perform the following tasks:
- monitoring of implementation of the programme in terms of compliance with assumptions
and goals specified in the programme,
- verification of assumptions of the programme on the basis of collected materials,
documents and evaluation of conducted activities,
- conducting informational activities, social consultations and publication of information
about implementation of the Programme,
- coordination of works related to implementation of the Local Action Plan.
The lowest level of monitoring will be the Report on Implementation of Actions, constituting
a standardised tool confirming performance of particular activities. This document
constitutes appendix 1 of this study. The Project manager transfers appendix to the unit
responsible for implementation of each of the activities, according to the schedule included
in chapter 4. Designated units must complete the report after completion of an assigned
action and send it by e-mail to the project manager, no later than until the end of a year for
which its implementation was planned. In the case of actions with multi-stage
implementation, the responsible entities fill out the report for a part of action, which,
according to the plan, was to be completed in a given year. Such a system of controlling
implementation of projects provides a possibility to react to encountered barriers and make
all necessary modifications of the action very quickly.
On the basis of reports from of execution of particular actions the project manager fills in
the Final Report for a given year, controlling the progress of the schedule and the financial
progress of actions, whose implementation was planned for that year. That document
constitutes Appendix no. 2 to this study. Evaluation of implementation of the Local Action
Plan with regard to the progress of the schedule and the financial progress will be made on
the basis of the final monitoring reports for each year. The evaluation report will be
composed of 3 parts, corresponding to the following research problems: Were designated
goals achieved?, What barriers were encountered during implementation? and Did it results
in positive transformations from the social and economic point of view? (an evaluation
report template constitutes Appendix no. 3 to this study).

7.2. SCHEDULE OF MONITORING MEETINGS
Monitoring meetings will take place once a year in the following periods:
- January 2019 (assessment of the implementation of actions aimed at achieving the
strategic objective and operational objectives planned in 2018)
- January 2020 (assessment of the implementation of actions aimed at achieving the
strategic objective and operational objectives planned in 2019)
- January 2021 (assessment of the implementation of actions aimed at achieving the
strategic objective and operational objectives planned in 2020)
- January 2022 (assessment of the implementation of actions aimed at achieving the
strategic objective and operational objectives planned in 2021)
Scope of monitoring: it will cover the implementation of activities aimed at achieving the
strategic objective and operational objectives planned to be carried out in 2018-2021.
Monitoring methods and tools: main - monographic method: analysis of reports on the
implementation of activities, summary of the calculation sheet with the financial plan,
supplementary - quality method: direct interviews with the units responsible for their
implementation.

Responsibility for carrying out: project manager or person indicated by him.
Monitoring organization: the responsible person collects reports on individual tasks that
were to be fully or partially completed by the end of 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021. Then, on
the ready monitoring card, enter the values of the achieved indicators and compare them
with the intended ones. Additionally, he conducts interviews when the report is imprecise.
The same procedure applies to all activities of the given scope of monitoring.
7.3. ACUTALIZATION OF THE LOCAL ACTION PLAN
The Local Action Plan will be updated at least once every three years by means of
verification in a social process, after public acceptance. The document's updating will be
prepared using a participatory process, the local community will be ensured, among others:
members of the Local Support Group, representatives of the commune and commune
organizational units, representatives of non-governmental organizations, representatives of
entrepreneurs, local leaders, representatives of other groups from the position stakeholders.
The application of this method will enable the participation of many people in the decisionmaking
processes, help take into account their opinions and enable the implementation of
common identified priorities.
The basis of actualization the LPD will be:
• monitoring of social phenomena,
• reaction to existing needs and the current situation (legal, economic, political and social
changes),
• changes and socio-economic trends,
• local environment opinions,
• evaluation processes.";"E.txt";"E"

Executive Summary 



Developed through the City Centre Doctor Project

Chapter : City Centre Context Chapter : The Process of Action Planning. Chapter : The Focus & Objectives of the Integrated Action Plan. Chapter : Actions and Schedule of the Integrated Action Plan Chapter : Risk Analysis Chapter : Monitoring and Communication Chapter 1 -The City Centre Doctor Context 
1.1) Introduction 
In September 2015, the city of Naas embarked on the City Centre Doctor Project which is a participative and integrated Action Planning Network with the purpose of defining a common and bottom up strategy to revitalize the heart of the cities, i.e. their city centres. 
This project is co-funded by Kildare County Council, the Municipality District of Naas and by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF). The City Centre Doctor Project provided the structure and the learning opportunity for the citizens, the community and sectoral interests to work with Kildare County Council and specifically the Naas Municipal District in making Naas a more vibrant town. This Integrated Action Plan represents their vision, objectives and strategies which will guide and inform the future of Naas 2018 -2025. 

Naas City Centre Doctor project is focused on the revitalization of Naas as a vibrant urban centre, with its own identity, in the East Region of Ireland. The overall objective is to facilitate the commercial/ business sector, local community groups, cultural and heritage interests to integrate and work together in identifying the key economic, social, cultural and community resources which can be developed over time as contributors to the revitalization of Naas. The project has the support of Kildare County Council, North Kildare Chamber, Kildare Lions Club, County Kildare LEADER Partnership, County Kildare Local Enterprise Office and other agencies. 

1.2) Naas -The Historic Development of the town 

The name Naas appears in three forms in the Irish language: An Nás, meaning ‘The Place of Assembly’; Nás Laighean, meaning ‘The Place of Assembly of the Leinstermen’; and Nás na Ríogh, meaning ‘The Place of Assembly of the Kings’. The last Naas King to be recognised as King of Leinster was Cearbhall who died in 909. After the Norman invasion of Ireland, the Barony of Naas was granted by Richard Strongbow in 1175 to Maurice Fitzgerald. The town grew into a Norman stronghold with castles, walls and gates. These fell into decay and by the end of the 16th century, Naas transformed into a key market town of the region. 

1.3) Naas – The County Town 
Naas is the administrative capital of County Kildare. Naas is a town characterised by its retail and commercial centre, with robust employment and enterprise opportunities, a strong community spirit and its quality built and natural heritage. Its proximity and connection to the national road network coupled with its strategic location within the Greater Dublin Area creates an attractive location for economic development in the form of significant employers and small/medium enterprise. Naas is also identified at a regional level as a location that can accommodate additional residential development. 

1.4) Naas Town Centre 
The centre of Naas reflects a great legacy from the past, with a street structure going back hundreds of years, and many of its buildings on Main Street dating from the early part of the 19th Century. The town today, still offers a rich range of shops, services, restaurants and bars. The current situation is that despite a fourfold increase in the 

overall population, the town centre has not developed in tandem, nor has it benefited to any noticeable extent from the significant surge in new residents, or from the extensive commercial peripheral development. The town centre would appear to have lost its economic vitality over recent decades. The challenge is to consider why the town centre of Naas is under-performing and how its potential can be realised. 

1.5) Public Spaces and Urban Structure 
In Naas, the central spine is Main St which extends from The Fairgreen to Market Square and continues to include Poplar Square. This forms the backbone of the public realm in terms of the revitalisation process. Another important dimension is the quality of the enclosing streetscape, with many buildings dating from the early to mid-19th Century. In addition, there is the splendid environment of the canal, the amenity lakes by Naas Hospital, and the generously scaled park in Monread. 
The focus is to generate a vision for the public realm, underpinned by a public domain strategy, which builds on the legacy of the traditional, incorporates the infrastructure of the canals, and engenders a powerful sense of unity between the heart of Naas and the town’s new and emerging neighbourhoods. It will also incorporate the Naas Neighbourhood Greenway -a walking & cycling network linking into the glorious hinterland of Naas -with the purpose of harnessing the visitor and recreational potential. 

1.6) Economic Development and Enterprise 
While the external perception of Naas may be that of a commuter town serving Dublin, the reality is that Naas has circa 12,000 jobs and has a net-inward flow of 4,000 commuters. However, one third of the Naas workforce commutes daily to Dublin for work. The geographical spread of jobs in Naas has changed over the decades with many of those 12,000 workplaces located on the periphery of Naas, with a low ratio of jobs now located in the central Naas area. While the new workplaces on the periphery constitutes success for Naas (e.g. circa 3000 jobs in Millennium Park with the arrival of the Kerry Group plc) and gives a powerful statement of intent in terms of knowledge economy direction, there appears to be a growing disconnection between the peripheral economy and the economy of the town centre. 
It is certain that the employment landscape in Naas will continue to change over the longer term, therefore the challenge for Naas will be to positively respond to the powerful global forces leading to innovation, automation and digitalisation in the economy. Success will be measured by the town’s ability to influence national and global investment patterns and resulting in more prospects for continued sustainable jobs. 

1.7) Social and Community Infrastructure 
Naas has many examples of excellent clubs and organisations supported through volunteers. In Naas there are literally hundreds of groups which come under the umbrella of ‘social and community’. Many of these groups respond to a perceived need in the community, for example the Naas Disability Access Group, or they were set up to organize a collective response to sporting or recreational needs, therefore the reputation of Naas as a “community” place is very positive. 

Sports facilities in the town include the Naas Golf Club, the Swimming Pool, the G.A.A Centre, Soccer and Rugby pitches and amenities, the Boxing Club, and Naas Athletics. In addition, there are the Community Games, Children’s Playgrounds, Scouts and Girl Guides, Youth Clubs and the Kildare Youth Services. 
McAuley Place is a great example of a collaborative initiative where residential accommodation for older people co-exists with an arts hub, a community centre and a town café, supported by a team of 80 committed volunteers. It has brought vibrancy and resilience into the heart of Naas. 
The key challenge is to continue to nurture these community and social instincts, while create institutional frameworks within which they can prosper. 

1.8) Connected Local Neighbourhoods 
The Naas Integrated Action Plan proposes to focus on the connection between where people live and how the local neighbourhoods can connect into the centre and contribute in developing the character of the town. The emphasis for the IAP focusses on well-designed open-spaces, which are attractively laid out and supported by services such as schools and local shopping. The local neighbourhood concept also incorporates well designed movement, providing access to the town centre and prioritizing walking, cycling and public transport. Monread and Lakelands represent good examples of local neighbourhood designs from the relatively recent past. 
The bigger picture challenge is to integrate the various emerging neighbourhoods into an overall urban structure, which works well for the whole town, and which supports a strong and viable town centre. The Millennium Park peripheral development presents a challenge in linking this edge of town corporate park and particularly all the employees working there, into the centre of Naas. The consolidation of the town centre also provides an opportunity for innovative high quality and denser residential accommodation. 

1.9) Movement and Infrastructure 
For most of the 20th Century, towns have facilitated access for the automobile and commercial traffic. The Naas URBACT Local Group has had much debate about the relationship of the car to its urban environment. The endless provision of road infrastructure to facilitate the car is proving to be counterproductive. The progressive view is that Naas needs more investment in public transport, there is also the requirement to redesign our streets and public spaces to achieve a better balance in favour of walkers, cyclists, and thus enhance the quality of life and appeal of our towns. Naas is fortunate to be connected to National Rail, and to enjoy a pivotal position on the motorway network. 
In line with our vision for Naas as a progressive and successful urban centre as the County Town, Naas ULG proposes a greater alignment involving public transport, walking and cycling, along with an integrated and attractive public domain that will enable such alignments. Because the complete removal of the car is not a feasible option, Naas requires a well -designed and managed strategy of vehicular access and restriction, supported by a consensus in public attitudes and behaviour towards a balance between different modes of transport.

2.3) The Action Planning Process 
The Naas ULG participated in a facilitated process starting in April 2016, which allowed its members to work together and to build a trusting relationship in the delivery of projects for the betterment of Naas. The monthly meetings/workshops supported the team to clarify a vision, set achievable objectives and scope out strategies for the revitalisation of Naas. 

The final stage of the development process was to identify and agree on a number of key actions/projects for Naas to be negotiated and agreed as the focus for the revitalisation of Naas over the lifetime of the Integrated Action Plan. The Integrated Action Plan, as endorsed by Kildare County Council, aims to secure funding for the development of the stated projects in response to calls for applications from central government and the European Operational Programmes. KCC in supporting this Integrated Action Plan demonstrates its commitment to the concept of community and urban regeneration.

To install hoardings and boards that will provide clear and easily accessible information on directions, parking, events and services. 
Chapter 5 -Risk Assessment & Analysis 

In the following chapter, the ULG describe the risks that Naas can anticipate when implementing the actions in order to achieve the objectives of the IAP as part of the City Center Doctor project. 

5.1) The Political risk 
The Municipal District elections will be held in 2019. The result of the elections may change the political reality which could have implications for the implementation of the current plans. Political change is a difficult one as it cannot really be approached with objectivity, you can only speculate. This risk can be tackled by assuring that the plan is communicated to all political parties and groupings and to actively pursue their buy-in. 

5.2) The Financial – Funding risk 
The ambitious actions in this plan require sufficient financial resources for implementation. If for some reason these funds cannot be sourced, or if they are limited, this presents a risk for the feasibility of the objectives in the plan. The risk can be mitigated by securing commitment for actions from budget holders and by emphasizing the value of collaboration leading to efficiently sharing and leveraging resources. 

5.3) The Community Engagement risk 
If there is insufficient momentum for the implementation of the IAP, there is a chance that Town Team (ULG) members will drop out. While there is evidence of energy in the creative process with idea formation, drawing up the basic actions and the implementation of the beta actions, there is a chance that this energy may be lost if there is a time lag /insufficient momentum in continuing the process post April 2018. The appointment of a Town Centre Coordinator is one determinant in offsetting this risk. 

5.4) The Agency Engagement risk 
The administrative pressure on agencies supporting the Project is a risk that can affect the achievement of objectives that the Naas ULG is targeting. Again, this risk can be classified as a scenario with alternatives. It is therefore very important to ensure that the revitalisation of Naas is prominently positioned within Kildare County Council. 

5.5) Staff and key Implementers 
The ambition and scope of the IAP for the revitalization of the center of Naas is big. As a result, there is a lot of expectation among the stakeholders to achieve the objectives. It’s difficult to rule out a situation where the key staff professionals and implementers may choose to change their work circumstances or may be tasked to a different project. This risk can be characterised as high and impactful. In order to deal with this, it is important to continue and consolidate the trust building and to have ongoing dialogue with the stakeholders in terms of the content and processes that are needed to achieve the best outcome. Also, important here is to keep the existing ULG strong and resilient with continuity into the new Town Team. The ULG is a very valuable linkage with a lot of knowledge and expertise. It is imperative and a worthwhile investment from a business and personal level for the future of Naas. 

5.6) The Marketing -Communications Risk 
If the financial, man-hours and infrastructural resources are not available, then the ambition to implement a marketing – communications strategy will be rendered more and more difficult. At the moment the Naas ULG is kept up to date via a WhatsApp and e-mail communications. The risk is that the core group of communicators become disconnected. The risk can be mitigated by making it a priority of the Town Centre Coordinator to maintain and encourage communications. 

Chapter 6: Monitoring and Communication 

6.1) Preamble 
This chapter provides the guidelines for monitoring of actions and the publicity and all the information related to the Naas Integrated Action Plan. At a local level and in the interim period, information and publicity actions will be coordinated by the staff of the Kildare County Council, with the support of the Naas ULG. It is proposed that the ULG will continue as an autonomous and self-sustaining entity (The Naas Town Team CLG), supported by a Town Centre Coordinator, after the funding period of City Centre Doctor Project ends. The Naas Town Team CLG when in place, will assume responsibility for monitoring of actions and for the communication of activities and the dissemination of information. 

6.2) Communication Objectives 
- To ensure transparency of information regarding the execution of the Action Plan and its integral projects. 
- To communicate and disseminate the content of the Action Plan and information 
related to the contribution of the ERDF and other Funds. 
- To inform the different target groups about European funding availability. 
- To make presentations of the IAP to the Naas Municipal District & to relevant external agencies and political groupings. 
- To follow-up with monitoring and control of actions and to communicate new  developments. 
- To organise meetings to progress the implementation of the IAP. 
- To publish the results of the specific actions in the IAP.
- To disseminate in the media relevant information about the progress of the IAP. 

6.3) Instruments for communications 
In accordance with the established regulatory provisions, the Town Team (ULG) members will assume the organisation of the following actions: 
. The organisation of Public Meetings to inform the citizens about the IAP. 
. Press conferences and press releases in local and regional newspapers. 
. Information brochures about the Town Team and IAP in general and specific 

information brochures and posters of the actions that are to be developed. . Continuous updating of developments in and for Naas town centre on the website and on social media platforms. 
. 	Hosting an annual seminar on the revitalisation of the town centre and the sharing of knowledge on the activities and impacts as well as to highlight the progress and achievements of the implementation of the IAP. 
. 	The list of beneficiaries, the names of the operators and the amount of public funds allocated to actions will be available on the website and on bulletin boards of the agencies involved.

Integrated Action Plan 
 
Town centre of Valašské Mezirící 
 
CityCenterDoctor 2018 
 

Executive Summary.
In 2015, the city of Valašské Mezirící was involved in the City Center Doctor project, which is implemented under the URBACT III Operational Program and brings together ten cities from ten European countries. The main idea of the City Center Doctor project is that even smaller cities can thrive in the shadows of larger cities if the centers of these cities are able to offer people the opportunity to shop, use services, spend their free time, or provide space for opening or developing business. 
 Ten partner cities were deliberately chosen on the basis of a detailed input analysis. For the project, this screening was absolutely vital because it helped narrow the number of potential partners in the resulting 10 cities. 

 
Project partners.
 
The main objective of this selection was to find cities of similar size with common geographical and demographic features. In particular, population and distance to larger settlement units are the most important indicators on the basis of which cities were selected. 
The terms used in the project are based on English technical terms. For clarity, these terms are explained at the beginning: 
program URBACT: the European Territorial Cooperation program, which aims to share experiences and ideas among European cities.

Lead Partner: the main Lead Partner / City, supervising the achievement of the general objectives of the project; manages all project and financial activities. At the beginning  of the project City Center Doctor, the city of Sopron (Hungary) had been the lead partner, but after first phase of project its authority has been taken by the city of San Dona di Piave (Italy). 
Lead Expert: the main facilitator and expert in the project; manages all project meetings and provides expert advice. Mr Wessel Badenhorst was entrusted with this task 1.  
More infromation retrived from: http://urbact.eu/badenhorst 
Project Partner: other project partners sharing experience and information on project development in individual cities. 
ULG: URBACT Local Support Group, a local support group that is the main building block of project outputs (see Chapter 2) 
  The town of Valašské Mezirící has a population of 22,179 as of January 1, 2018, but it provides state administration services in its administrative district for more than 41,000 inhabitants. The city has a large number of machinery and chemicals industries. The main symbol of the town is the two rivers, Vsetínská and Rožnovská Becva, which flow through the city. The town of Valašské Mezirící is also an important transport route. For the city center, road 57, which lies close to the city center, is absolutely vital. Together with Rožnovská Becva river, it creates the boundary of the city center (for a detailed description see chapter 1). The city center is also protected by law, where the city's monument zone was proclaimed throughout the city center. This provides basic monument protection for buildings within the city center. In the immediate vicinity of the square there is the castle of Žerotín, which is a symbol of the town´s cultural life. The entire church is dominated by the Christian Church of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary with a high Baroque church tower. As part of business services, the city center is an indispensable backbone for the banking and postal services. You can also find here a number of restaurants, cafes, feast offices or specialized shops. At present, however, the city center is significantly competing with shopping centers on the outskirts of the city. 
At the beginning of the project, the town of Valašské Mezirící had only basic information oabout the visitors 'and inhabitants' opinion of the city center. The main driving force for engaging in the project was, in particular, the empirical observation of important actors in public affairs who perceived decreasing attendance at the city center. This fact is evident so far, especially during the weekends, the city center is absolutely alive. This factor is then one of many reasons why the population has been decreasing for a long time (at the beginning of 2015, 
Valašské Mezirící had a total of 22,750, compared to 22,179 at the beginning of 2018). Another important factor for why the city has begun to address its city center in detail is the linking of the project to the planned reconstruction of the city center. The town has long been preparing to reconstruct an almost 100-year-old square. However, this reconstruction should be synergistic with other city activities, so that it creates a coherent concept. This document should also be helpful. The aim is to create a quality, pleasant and attractive environment for the town ´s citizens. This document aims to present a comprehensive plan to prove this 
 The main vision for the further development of the city center is: 

 Live and attractive center of the city.
 
 
The city center should be alive, it should be a space where its visitor will feel comfortable, safe and find appropriate sports that can take the form of shopping, use of services, participation in cultural events, but also just walking or sitting with friends. 
The city center of Valašské Mezirící should be attractive, ie. people should come not only from necessity (use of services, etc.), but on the contrary, the city center should become a natural place for spending free time or shopping, as a magnetic center of the city, which will be sought after by citizens and visitors. 
The definition of this vision is based on initial activities within the project, in particular a thorough analysis of the city center (see chapter 1). This is based both on the observation of stakeholders and on the questionnaire survey carried out in 2016. These outputs are particularly advantageous in their possible re-verification or comparison of how much they have succeeded in meeting the set vision. The goal is to increase the number people shopping at the city center each day by at least by 9 %, two to three times a week by 8% and at least once a week by 8%. To meet this goal, it is particularly important to improve accessibility to the city center and to create the necessary infrastructure for both automobile transport and for pedestrian visitors to the center as well. The vision of the city center is, in particular, to continue to expand the quality of products and services. The town hall is aware that it can not directly influence current economic entities within this framework. However, the aim is to motivate current entrepreneurs and to involve them in the issues of public space development. The goal is to increase the number of people who like shopping in the city center by at least by 10 % over the next five years. 
For quality public space, the development of not only the business function but also its social potential is essential. The goal is to increase the number of people spending their free time every day in the city center during the summer period by at least by10 %, twice to three times a week at least by 6 % and once a week at least by 7 %. In particular, the development of leisure time options for the city center is essential for achieving these goals. This should be helped by both high-quality infrastructure of civic amenities and the development of private-sector activities. Overall, the target is to increase the number of citizens who enjoy spending by 9 % of their leisure time in the city center. This situation will be reflected in particular on private activities, with the aim of increasing the number of mass events held by private bodies for at least by 6 events per year. The town hall will continue to enter these activities, but not as a main organizer, but rather as a mediator and will only provide the necessary technical background. All of these objectives came from both the primary analysis of the city center and the activities of the local support group, which is behind all the major activities linked to the City Center Doctor project 
The Integrated Action Plan represents a new approach to the strategic development of the public space and is, by its nature, the first document of its kind in the territory. As a result, it will contribute especially to deciding on other plans and plans for the development of the city center. The Integrated Action Plan aims to identify the city center, define its boundaries, analyze the basic data, relationships and links that inhabitants have with the city center and identify its strengths and weaknesses, opportunities and threats. The main objective of the documentary is to propose measures that will help to create a good place to live and meet the inhabitants and visitors of the city from the city center. The implementation of these measures should then lead to the fulfillment of the stated goals and visions. The essence of this document is in particular its ability to update. The Integrated Action Plan does not propose immutable measures but provides a modern approach to integrating citizens into the decision-making process. The great benefit and goal of the whole document is to guide all actors in public affairs how to improve the space around them. Conventional residents face a clear YES / NO decision, but thanks to this document they will be able to participate directly in the agenda setup. These activities have been tested in the pilot actions and activities of the two-year City Center Doctor project. An absolute novelty was the establishment of the so-called Local Support Group (ULG). 
The local support group is an important element of this document. All the outcomes and conclusions came from the group's activities. Prior to the implementation of the City Center Doctor project, it was necessary to propose its composition. This task was made on the basis of 
the decision of the town of Valašské Mezirící. Already before the physical realization of the project, the city had selected possible members. These were selected on the basis of experience from previous joint activities. Membership in the ULG is absolutely voluntary and does not make any financial consideration. The main prerequisite was the active approach of members and their interest in the public space. This interest was increased especially due to the planned reconstruction of the square, which is undoubtedly one of the most important plans for the development of the city center in the last decade. Members of the ULS were supposed to be actively involved in all project activities as well as a degree of creativity in the development of potential development projects. Members of the ULG were selected on the basis of their experience and profession. The aim was to create a professional body with cross-sectional knowledge in all areas. As a result, the ULG brought together marketing professionals, architects, social services experts, entrepreneurs, students and other people who have a public sphere. These members were subsequently supplemented by employees of the town of Valašské Mezirící who, thanks to their expertise, were able to stimulate a detailed qualitative discussion and, in particular, to contribute a basic knowledge of the possibilities and powers of the city. The whole group is managed by its coordinator, who was selected from the employees of the city of Valašské Mezirící, in particular from the City Development Department. Here, emphasis was placed on his professional qualifications and language skills. He then provided ULG information transmission among the most important political actors. At the level of city management, the Vice-Mayor of PaedDr. Yvona Wojaczková became the guarantor of all activities, who has the competence of the development of the city center (especially the reconstruction of the square). 
The activities of the ULG were mainly set out from binding indicators set at the beginning of the project. ULG members not only participated in foreign project meetings but also actively participated in other project activities. Within two years, this group has done a lot of important work. At the outset, their outcomes stood behind a detailed analysis of the city center, which identified the main goals and visions of the project. Within this project phase a SWOT analysis or tree of problems was created. Thanks to these activities, they succeeded in identifying the basic challenges, which city center faces today. These events were then followed by activities for generating ideas. Several events have been organized that have already brought real plans for the development of the city center. For example public meeting that allowed the citizens of the city to comment on the proposed intentions, but also to discuss the main intentions and visions of the development of the city center. All these activities are then 
complemented by a detailed analysis of the proposed measures and the most relevant ones. Within the project, so-called Beta actions were also carried out, which served to verify the main vision of city development. During the year 2017, two beta actions were implemented. The first was to revive the city center with the help of an interactive exposition. There were two game locations in the square where citizens could play board games. The aim was to introduce other, alternative, means of innovating the leisure time infrastructure. This was also helped by the installation of a beach volleyball court, which added to the possibility of sports activities. The implementation of this course was fully covered by the city budget. Thanks to these summer activities, the interest of active citizens in the city center has been increased and they have the opportunity to enjoy the necessary leisure time. The second beta event was the realization of an interactive light game during the light festival held in September 2017. Here we managed to implement video camps on the town hall building, which was connected with a special program. Using a special spray-type controller, visitors could create different graphs or images. Especially among children, this event was very much appreciated. The whole purpose of the festival was to revive the city center and attract citizens to an unusual visual experience. The result exceeded expectations, according to estimates, the city center was visited by some 7,000 citizens. This beta action also aimed at increasing the attractiveness of the city center and demonstrated that creative and modern ideas can activate a wide range of citizens. 
Last but not least, ULG members have entered this document, especially in the context of its design section. The great contribution of the ULG was in particular the active participation of members during the organization of the project meeting in Valašské Mezirící. All of these activities were cross-sectioned in particular through communication. The ULG manages its own pages on social networks and provides basic information through its block. A detailed description of all ULG activities is included in Chapter 2. 
All of the above mentioned activities have led to the creation of a stack of development plans that will fulfill the main vision of the development of the city center: a lively and attractive city center. For all identifiable development intentions, their reference to the current needs of the city center is in common. The proposed actions are based on the expert discussion at the ULG level and reflects the conclusions of the ideas-generating activities. All ideas and actions were part of the project activities that took place during 2017. The ULG played a major role in planning, all of which proposed and then approved. In the context of the planning of the proposed measures, project activities, in particular the project meeting in the Spanish Medina del Campo where the first idea sharing took place, were completed in Nord-sur-Edre in France. 
During this project activity, a so-called ""Idea Exchange"" took place, where all project partners prepared at least five of their ideas and measures. These ideas were subsequently presented to other partners and a detailed discussion of the proposed wording took place. Several useful ideas were subsequently taken over and introduced at the local level, ie within the ULG negotiations. This is, for example, a new navigation system using LED technology. All proposed measures are based on previous activities. All presented ideas were then narrowed down to several relevant and most meaningful activities that, according to the ULG, will be the most effective for the development of the city center and its recovery. 
The final version of all ideas and measures was agreed within the ULG. In addition, members of the ULG had the opportunity to comment on all measures, or to suggest additional activities. The simplified list of proposed measures is annexed to this document. For the final list, the project meeting in Idrija (Slovenia) was crucial, when the process of setting the timetable, the way of financing and the involvement of local stakeholders was presented in detail. The measures are also based on the project meeting held in Valasske Mezirici. During this meeting, ideas for the town of Valašské Mezirící were presented to foreign experts who, during the Peer Review activity, reflected these ideas with the current form of the city center. Thanks to all the above-mentioned activities, the measures are presented as a result of a long-term process of meetings and meetings, both at international level and at local level.  
The results are: 
 
1, Reconstruction of the square 
The planned reconstruction of the square in Valašské Mezirící was one of the main reasons why the town of Valašské Mezirící became part of the City Center Doctor project. The goal is to complete the reconstruction of the square including all areas. This activity includes both new engineering networks and a new comprehensive downtown mobile center, a new watermark on the square, and an overall simplification of pedestrian traffic. The whole square should be completely barrier-free. In addition, in the context of car traffic, a compromise solution has been reached, where pedestrian areas have expanded to the detriment of parking spaces. Since the last adaptation has passed the square 85 years ago, it is a necessary reconstruction, which is one of the largest investment activities of the city. At present, the project documentation for the building permit, including all necessary elements, has already been developed. The construction works are expected to begin either during 2018 or 2019. A 
detailed description of the city center that entered the project documentation is part of this document as its annex. 
 
2, Construction of a parking lot 
Traffic service and parking is one of the core activities of the city center. To improve the safety of pedestrians and cyclists, it is necessary to reduce traffic in the city center. The most common reason why this is not possible is the lack of sufficient number of parking spaces in the city center. For these reasons, it is necessary to build a parking space for further development. This also records the fact that part of the plots - the defence, are owned by the city. Thanks to this, a parking lot could be built on Pospíšilova Street, so that a subway, which is currently dilapidated, could be used. The goal is to build at least 250 parking spaces, including new retail outlets. Thanks to this house, it would be both a logical filling of the current vacancy in the development and the extension of the services offered in the city center. The parking lot would significantly reduce the traffic load of the city center, which would only be used for transport services. This would increase the space for other activities on the square and adjacent streets. 
 
3, New pedestrian zones in the city center 
Thanks to the above-mentioned measures, it will be possible to build several new pedestrian zones. Already in 2015 a new pedestrian zone was opened on Mostní Street. As part of the complex development of the city center, it is proposed to build at least two new pedestrian zones in the Krížkovský and Pospíšilová streets, following the reconstruction of the square. These are places where the minimum traffic is already today, but the existing transport service does not allow for example the construction of new restaurant gardens or the placement of benches and other necessary furniture. In the minimum dimension, only the traffic signs and the use of the roads in the city property are envisaged. In the most ideal case, a new pedestrian zone with new surfaces could be made with this measure, such as on Mostní Street. This measure was also confirmed during the project meeting in Valašské Mezirící, where foreign experts stressed the need to expand pedestrian zones. Pedestrian zones could be extended to other streets in the city center, however, provided the transport issue (ie a parking lot) is resolved. 
4, New navigation system (totems) 
There is currently an obsolete navigation system in the city in the form of a totem. However, he no longer meets current requirements and, in particular, does not provide adequate information for visitors to the city. As part of this measure, a new system, consisting of at least 
15 new signs, is planned. These would be deployed at the most important traffic hubs and would provide basic information on how to get to the city center. Totems would not only provide walking directions but also information on attendance time (city center, hospital, observatory, sports area, etc.). Totems would also be equipped with LED technology that would graphically differentiate the area by character. This simple graphic would then be part of the information panels, which would make it simpler for all visitors. This measure was created at the instigation of Spanish experts who have great experience in this field. 
 
5, Summer activities 
The city center of Valašské Mezirící is currently used mainly for cultural events (performances in cultural festivals, etc.) and events such as farms or Christmas markets. These are actions that will revive the city center and attract the inhabitants. However, it is (with the exception of the farmers' markets, which are part of the year running periodically once every two weeks) for one-off events. For the rest of the year the square ""does not live"", because residents have no reason to come to the center and spend free time here. There is no opportunity for leisure activities. Summer activities should be conceived as longer-term events (June, July and August), which would create the conditions for residents to get to the center and spend their free time there. These activities may include both cultural and sporting activities. The first thing to do was to install a free beach volleyball court on the square, pumpingtrack tracks, or install free board games. From feedback, it is clear that actions of a similar type have the potential to revive the square. Consequently, it is proposed to proceed further. The use of both sports and game elements, as well as the organization of, for example, open-air exhibitions. 
 
  
6, Summer festival 
In Valašské Mezirící there is a certain tradition of festivals, which are mainly associated with culture and mostly are also attended by representatives of partner cities (Days of Town, Valašský Špalícek). The organizer is the town of Valašské Mezirící. This is an action that can substantially revive the city center. In addition to the aforementioned festivals organized directly by the town of Valašské Mezirící, the so-called Streed-Food festival, organized by a private subject focused on gastronomy, was organized in the past in the city center. The festival brought to the citizens of the city an unusual experience in the city center, where they could taste the range of gastronomic specialties. Chilli-Man was also the culmination of this event. The Light Festival, organized by a private association, was also newly organized in 2017, however due to relatively high costs, city support and support for local companies (eg Robe Lighting) was needed. It was an original and unique event that revived a city center where various lighting installations were located, and participants could also see extensive video projections. The aim is to create conditions for similar events that have the enormous potential to revitalize the city center, to offer new and unusual experiences in the public space, and to motivate citizens to spend their free time in the city center. In addition, these activities generate additional effects, such as boosting city traffic, which in turn brings economic multiplier effects. There is the possibility to support private entities that come up with interesting ideas, to address these entities and to create conditions for the activities of the city of Valasske Mezirici to support such actions (public areas, transport regulation, publicity and promotion, security etc.). 
 
7, Access to urban underground 
The town of Valašské Mezirící is a historical town, whose roots date back to the Middle Ages. In the square there are historic buildings that are undercooked. These are historic dwellings, and there is a presumption that these spaces were interconnected in the past to form an extensive underground complex. Part of the space is used for cultural and business purposes. E.g. cellars under the castle of Žerotín, managed by the Cultural Center of the city, serve for various cultural and social events, concerts, theater performances, balls, etc. The cellars of the house U Cerného orla are in turn used by a restaurant that operates on the first floor above the cellar among others, used as a disco. The rest of the cellars have no access to the public. The intention is a comprehensive mapping of the historical underground of the city, including the corridors that should lead under the square, the agreement with the owners of these premises, 
the creation of a concept of utilization (tours, cultural activities, etc.), the necessary reconstructions and the subsequent public access. At present, there is only an ideological intent. 
 
8, Reconstruction of the bridge 
The town of Becva flows through the town, which previously formed the border of two towns, whose connection took place in 1924, creating the town of Valašské Mezirící. The watercourse is located near the square and is one of the imaginary lines defining the city center. There is also a bridge for pedestrian and car transport, which is an important transport link. This is a bridge on Mostní Street, which is a direct route to the square. The bridge is in poor technical condition, which needs to be addressed. For this reason, a complex reconstruction will take place, which will also remove the entire bridge over the supporting structure. The concept of the bridge, the pavement, the sidewalks and the railing will also be changed. The reconstructed bridge will not only become a safe and dignified transport link to the city center but will also bring a new concept that will increase the attractiveness of the city center. Reconstruction of the bridge is fully projected. 
 
9, Revitalization of the embankment 
The town of Valašské Mezirící is situated at the confluence of two rivers. The watercourse also forms one of the boundaries that defines a defined city center. The connection is provided by several bridges. Part of the Becva River embankment is in a state of disrepair, which significantly reduces the attractiveness of this environment. In some places, various minor interventions are taking place, especially as green revitalization, however some parts of the embankment require more substantial intervention. The aim is to revitalize these areas, create new spaces, adjust their use and thus to cultivate and make the environment more attractive. The reconstruction involves the reconstruction and the construction of new roads, parking spaces or public areas. This intervention will improve the environment of the city center, which is adjacent to the river and also the possibilities of using this interesting locality. Revitalization of the embankment is still at the stage of ideological intent.

The URBACT method was essential to create this integrated action plan. These are a number of tools that enable high-quality involvement of the general public, experts, and city leaders. These measures aim to generate solutions and intentions based on discussion and compromise. All realized project activities are then based directly on URBACT methods. The most important thing, of course, is the establishment of the ULG, which carries out project activities. The advantage is that each project partner has to establish his own group. Of course, ULG members have been able to participate in project meetings and thus further help to share experience and good practice across the Europe. These meetings were very important for a better idea of the situation in the city. Without working directly in the terrain, it would not be possible to properly understand the development plans of the cities. The peer review was also a great added value. This tool provided detailed descriptions of the city center through the eyes of unbiased experts. Expert findings then served as the next point of contact in defining their own intentions and visions. Similarly, it was also during the project meeting in Valašské Mezirící, which provided important feedback on the current state of the city center. Another method that has been used to prepare documents for this document was direct work within the ULG. This was based in particular on the findings of the URBACT Summer University held in Rotterdam, Netherlands. Here are the most important aspects for working with the ULG. For example, a SWOT analysis, tree problem, or OPERA method. Within the project activities themselves, emphasis was placed on the use of URBACT methods. This is evidenced, for example, by the realization of the so-called Idea Café which, in an informal setting, allowed the presentation of one's own visions and subject matter to the general public. All the implemented methods and activities were based on a predefined methodology, which was adapted to local conditions. 
Like any strategic document, this detail defines the way to reach the goals set. The main carrier of all the measures presented is the town of Valašské Mezirící. Most of the measures introduced can only be implemented with the direct involvement of the city. Especially financial and human resources will be decisive. This will be particularly evident in large investment projects. Like every city, Valasske Mezirici has to diversify its resources and all project intentions are subject to decisive selection at the level of city management. Especially in this area, the ULG, or its continuing structure, will be of utmost importance. It is expected that a questionnaire survey will be carried out to compare the extent to which the stated objectives have been met. These results will then be reflected by city leaders. For smaller measures (summer activities, street festival), the ULG members are actively involved in implementing 
these plans. However, they will not be covered by the city's financial resources, but in particular from sponsorship and donations or sales proceeds. However, the city will enter into these activities as material and personal support. A detailed description of this process is part of Chapter Five. 
In order to properly evaluate the fulfillment of the set objectives, the monitoring of the attractiveness of the city center is also expected after the completion of the project implementation. The operationalization of the stated goals was based on the basic premise that the attractiveness of the city center will increase the number of its visitors. This will improve the local economy, promote small business and, in particular, improve leisure time opportunities for the population, bringing stabilization to the population and helping to stop the outflow of citizens. The verification of these targets will be based in particular on basic statistical data compiled by the Czech Statistical Office. In particular, in the context of meeting the objectives set out in this document, a re-iteration of the questionnaire survey with the same issues will play a crucial role. This will make it possible for key actors to compare and evaluate the measures implemented with the previous status. After this comparison, the evaluation of the success of the given measures will be very simple. This evaluation will be based in particular on the measures in place. It assumes the use of the questionnaire survey for two years in connection with the implemented measures. In evaluating project outputs, emphasis will also be placed on the use of modern technologies (person counters, footfall, use of camera system in the city center, data of mobile network operators, etc.). The goal is to get the most appropriate and accurate data. All of these data will then help in the overall evaluation of project outputs. 
The success of individual measures will also be subject to evaluation. Emphasis will be put on the specific objectives and the fulfillment of the established indicators. Each proposed measure deliberately targets other areas of urban development. The same methods and tools as described above will be used. These will be followed by the ULG members' activities. The project cycle itself, set in the internal structure of the city, assumes the evaluation of realized projects. This will happen even if the measures are implemented. However, this evaluation will be supplemented by the work of ULG members, where active participation is foreseen. The goal is to evaluate its contribution to the overall objectives of the project after implementing any measure. All these activities are then complemented by detailed monitoring and communication activities of the project (see chapters 7 and 8).

"IAP – Summary - IDRIJA 
 
VISION STATEMENT 
 
The centre of Idrija is protected by UNESCO and it is the location of the majority of monuments 
connected to the town's history of mercury mining. Idrija’s city centre developed just above the 
mine, so the development of the mine influenced the development of the town and its urban 
structure. In the future Idrija has a new focus – before it diversified from mining town to industrial – and now stepping on the way of building a smart city. 
 
Idrija has a tradition of building and retaining knowledge and innovation as evident in its mercury mining heritage, industrial heritage, historical buildings and its cultural practices and artefacts (nurturing its ‘intangible’ heritage). Idrija is located in an area of beautiful nature. All of these are the reasons for its transition. The vision for Idrija is to become a city that is socially-just, innovative, sustainable, heritage-inspired and specialised. To achieve those goals Idrija has embarked the mission of creating a smart community. 
 
Everything is tightly connected to the city centre. In next months there will be new big shop in the city centre so IAP might be really helpful on the field of encouraging retailers and helping fill the empty spaces. It will definitely address the problem that can come out of that and take advantage of the pluses it will bring (more parking spaces and hopefully more people in the city centre). 
 
IAP adresses poor social life in the city centre and empty public spaces, poor retail offer in the city centre and migration of young people of Idrija.  
 
Since one of the specific objectives is community building there will be direct impact on the more vulnerable groups and also direct impact with some actions on all local people since it will bring new things in the city centre and will help people socialize more. The other plus size of that objective is direct to the city centre which will be fuller now. 
 
We see the city centre in next few years as a place to go after work – for shopping, relaxing and socializing. It will (hopefully) be full of people on daily basis which will be helpful also to existing shops and fill in the empty spaces. All actions are going hand to hand but also standing on its own in case that some of them won’t be successful. From the draft of IAP till now there were already some changes made – specially through meetings with important stakeholders. During the meetings they all got good insights where are the needs and what should be done. Before IAP was even finalised actions started soon after draft was presented. We believe IAP is already important from that perspective and it will be a really good reminder and help to keep the focus in the future. 
 
PROCESS INTRODUCTION 
 
Idrija is one of 10 partner cities participating in the City Centre Doctor Project. Idrija joined in the 2nd stage. Project aims (aimed) to develop an integrated action plan to revitalise our city centre. 
 
At the start of the project Urban Local Group was established. The Municipality established a working group representing all stakeholders who will develop and implement actions to revitalise the city centre. ULG had also emphasis of including stakeholders who didn’t join ULG and kept them connected with the process – especially when IAP was formed. 
 
ULG had regular meetings where it planned activities as it was place analysis, generating ideas and developing action plans. It had more meetings at the end of the project where IAP was finalising and also planned local event where ULG tried to raise awareness on the IAP. Event was organised in a way where there was a short presentation of process of writing IAP and then people who attended had chances to directly impact and give opinions on the objectives and actions planned. Opinion of ULG is that IAP has to be written for achieving its goals with collaboration with the local community.  
 
 

 
 
MAIN CHARACTERISTICS AND CHALLENGES 
 
Idrija is located in the south-eastern foothills of the Alps in Slovenia and has almost 12,000 inhabitants. It spans an area of 293.7 km2. It is known for its industrial heritage as one of the main mercury mining locations globally and for its cultural heritage, lace-making and as the home of žlikrofi (traditional Slovenian dumplings). It has a UNESCO heritage designation. 
The town of Idrija has kept a lifeline to the mine, resulting in a number of buildings in its old town closely linked to mining being preserved to this very day. These include the Gewerkenegg Castle, the first Slovenian secondary school for natural sciences, miners’ theatre, mine’s wheat storage Magazin, a number of miners' houses, churches, squares and other buildings. The city centre is a historical centre built close to the river Nikova. The new business development phase was more removed from the centre. 
Even though Idrija is small, with difficult road access, absence of trains and other connections, it has developed into an important global and regional node, with a growing economy. Idrija has a lower unemployment rate in 2017 than in the rest of Slovenia at 5.3% while the number on national level is 7.8%. 
The Municipality of Idrija has a clear vision for the future and is constantly working in a way to achieve its goals namely: to be environmentally-friendly, socially just and high-tech developed. And all of this to be based on its rich industrial and cultural heritage. A strategy for building smart communities will result in a development of smart grids, smart mobility systems and smart governance. All the strategies are always based on the needs and demands of the environment and inhabitants. 
Idrija has also entered the network of Alpine towns and communities where it is often recognized as a model town for smart community development, heritage reuse and youth engagement. The Municipality is in the process of adopting a sustainable urban mobility plan (SUMP), where electric mobility is recognized as one of the most important challenges for transition. 
The strong reason that Idrija is successful is that it is home to headquarters of their two homegrown multi-national companies. The growth and innovations of these two companies also means a culture of growth and innovation in Idrija. The two companies are socially responsible and aware of the importance of their presence and impact on the city. Kolektor for example has a vision for the town to become a ‘’municipality of knowledge’’ – both thus collaborate well with the Jurij Vega Grammar School in Idrija and regularly invest in local education provision. 
Main challenges which Idrija has to (IS) addressing in connection with revitalising city centre are really poor social life in the city centre, limited use of public spaces, poor retail offer and out migration of young people. 
  
SET OF OBJECTIVES AND ACTIONS 
 
SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE: URBAN FURNITURE 
 

Action 1: 
BENCHES ON THE OLD SQUARE 
(adressing the problem of lack of use of public spaces) 

Action 2: 
NEW ‘IMAGE’ OF IDRIJA – PROCESS ACTION 
(changing the fence near the river on the road leading to the city centre and finishing image with benches in the centre 


Action 3: 
BENCHES ON THE MAIN SQUARE 
(adressing the problem of lack of use of public spaces) 



 
 
SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE: ENCOURAGING RETAILERS 
 

 
Action 1: 
REDUCTION OF COSTS FOR RETAILERS 
(adressing problem of empty shops in city centre and high expences for renting the places) 

 


Action 2: 
RENT-A-SHOP 
(addressing the problem of lack of connection with public sector and old retail offer – action to bring something new to city centre) 



 
 
SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE: MOBILITY 
 

Action 1: 
PUBLIC BYCICLE SHARING SYSTEM (adressing the problem of high car-dependancy) 


Action 2: 
LOWERING NUMBER OF PARKING SPACES IN THE CITY CENTRE (adressing the problem of too much cars in the city centre) 



 
SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE: COMMUNITY BUILDING 
 

Action 1: 
COMUNITY CENTRE 
(adressing the problem of poor social life and higher and higer health problems as a result of lack of socialization) 
 


Action 2: 
PLAYGROUND ON THE CITY SQUARE 
(adressing the problem of poor social life) 


 
  
METHOD 
 
Good example of URBACT methods used was successful beta action – Playground on the city square. It was really greatly accepted and there was a lot of people attending an event. When we made a draft of IAP and had meetings with stakeholders Municipality already agreed to fund more actions like that and even gave the money for additional events of ‘’Playground on the city square’’. Beta action resulted in actual action and direct impact on happening in the city centre – more people coming to use usually empty public spaces. Now they come to play even when there is no events on the city square. 
 
Of course, all of it started with Idea café where we generated ideas. Some of that ideas are also included in IAP. We followed the path proposed from our lead expert – and it was successful. It was also really helpful to visit other partner cities and to see similar problems as an outsider or getting new ideas and learning from their successful actions. 
 
ULG POST-PROJECT  
 
Our ULG group already decided to stay as a group also after City Centre Doctor Project. They were invited to become also a group of Interreg Central Europe project BhENEFIT. Since main part of historical buildings are in the city centre there is an interesting connection between the projects. The BhENEFIT project focuses on improving the management of historic built areas, combining the daily maintenance of historic heritage with its preservation and valorisation in a sustainable way. We already started to work together and the result is that people are getting more and more interested in what is happening regarding City Centre Doctor project. 
 
Members agreed that it will be also easier to keep group together and keep an eye to IAP implementation afterwards if they have another cause to meet and there will be invitation to official meeting sent. 
 
FINAL ASPECTS 
 
ULG expect that IAP will be fully implemented and is really optimistic. From the start when we started gathering ideas what we should include in IAP and what the main specific objectives should be. The specific objectives and actions were defined on the basis of Place Analysis report, ideas and wishes collected at Idea café and later when draft of IAP was made the opinions from different stakeholders were collected on separate meetings with all of them. 
 
There was also a meeting with mayor of Municipality of Idrija and the whole process and all actions were presented to him. Since we worked together with important stakeholders we think that results can be better and more successful because they now know what IAP is and what we want to do. We also included their opinions which were really helpful to get an image what is possible to do and where the main problems may arise. 
 
We will check if there is a progress in implementation of IAP by checking where we are with all the actions at the end of 2018 and repeat it in the middle of 2019 and 2020. We hope that all actions will be implemented by then.

INTEGRATED ACTION PLAN
AMARANTE
CITY CENTRE DOCTOR




EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The city of Amarante is part of an European network of nine cities whose objective is to share knowledge and good practices among them in order to plan actions that transform city centres into a pole of economic competitiveness and well-being for citizens. The City Centre Doctor project, funded by the URBACT III Program, the European Union Territorial Cooperation Program, is aimed at small and medium-sized cities close to major urban centres.
This project was the right context for a participatory and collaborative approach with local stakeholders to strategically think about the development of the urban centre of Amarante, planning a set of innovative pilot actions that positively transform the city, reinforcing it as a, comfortable, culturally attractive, environmentally friendly and economically dynamic urban centre.
The Urbact methodology, described in this document, has allowed the development of intervention strategies with local agents and the exchange of experience and knowledge of good practices with other European cities, increasing the knowledge about which actions/projects are most suitable for Amarante.
From the work developed over two years by a collaborative and participative team, the access to the knowledge of international experts in the theme and the exchange of international experiences with the other nine cities involved in the network, resulted a shared vision that is reflected in this Action Plan. Through its execution, Amarante will be reaffirmed as a city of excellence to live in, attractive to invest and a place of choice to visit.
Throughout this document will be shared the diagnosis made to the city centre, which served as the basis and inspiration for the structuring of the pilot actions and later for the construction of the Integrated Action Plan, consisting in nine projects, whose objective is the transformation of the city centre of Amarante.
 


1 | CONTEXTUALIZATION

“This is what a city is, bits and pieces that supplement each
other and support each other.”
Jane Jacobs

1.1 URBACT PROGRAM
For over 15 years the URBACT program was the European Territorial Cooperation program with the aim of promoting integrated and sustainable urban development in European cities. It is an instrument of cohesion policy, co-financed by the European Regional Development Fund, the 28 Member States, Norway and Switzerland.
URBACT’s mission is to enable cities to work together and develop integrated solutions to common urban challenges by networking, learning from each other’s experiences, drawing lessons and identifying best practices to improve their urban policies.
Following the success of the URBACT I and II programs, URBACT III (2014-2020) has been developed to further promote integrated sustainable urban development and contribute to the implementation of the Europe 2020 strategy (link is external).
The URBACT III program is organized around four main objectives:
1. Policy delivery capacity: improving the capacity of cities to manage sustainable urban policies and practices in an integrated and participatory manner.
2. Political Project: to improve the design of sustainable urban policies and practices in cities.
3. Policy implementation: improving the implementation of integrated and sustainable urban strategies and actions in cities. 
4. Building and Sharing Knowledge: to ensure that professionals and decision makers at all levels have access to knowledge and share knowledge on all aspects of sustainable urban development in order to improve urban development policies.
To achieve these objectives, URBACT III develops 3 types of interventions:
1. Transnational exchanges, 
2. Training,
3. Capitalization and dissemination.

1.2 CITY CENTRE DOCTOR PROGRAM
The City Centre Doctor project is funded by the URBACT III Program, the Territorial Cooperation Program of the European Union, which aims to transform small and medium-sized urban centres located on the outskirts of large cities, in areas of economic competitiveness and well-being for citizens.
Over three years, action plans for the development of city centres have been developed, with the support of international experts, involving local action groups, and networking with 9 other European cities.
Participating cities: Amarante, Portugal; Heerlen, The Netherlands; Idrija, Slovenia; Medina del Campo, Spain; Naas, Ireland; Nort-sur-Erdre, France; Petrinja, Croatia; Radlin, Poland; San Dona di Piave, Italy; Valmez, Czech Republic.

1.3 AMARANTE CITY CENTRE
The appearance of the village of Amarante, the present urban centre, is strongly related to its geographical position. Occupying a privileged place of connection between the coast and the interior of Portugal, and being crossed by a Roman axis with great affluence, Amarante with linear organization, similar to a street, evolves from its time immemorial, distinguishing itself as place of passage and of exchange of goods. From village to city, its original design remained until the present day. Traditional trade continues to play a major role in urban dynamics and to be present in the older streets.
Crossed by Tâmega River and surrounded by Marão and Aboboreira mountains, Amarante has as a primordial image the presence of nature throughout the county. It is a green city, with a centre rich in natural spaces as are the example of the Forest Park and the «ínsuas» (islands in the middle of the river).
The heritage is also another very strong feature of the city. From the middle-ages S. Gonçalo Monastery and S. Gonçalo Bridge, brand images of the city, to the numerous Romanesque constructions spread by the county that enrich it culturally.
The Amarante urban centre suffered profound transformations as a result of the economic and social dynamics of Portuguese society, which affected the urban agglomerations. This is the case of processes like suburbanization and dispersion that have prevailed in recent decades, with the displacement of people to the outskirts of the city and to former rural areas, resulting in the sudden increase of individual mobility. This trend although  attenuated is still observed, creating an enormous impact on the historical areas, contributing to their economic and social devitalisation and their inability to respond to the growing number of vehicles invading the city every day. The large distances between home-work in a city with the size of Amarante (301.33km2), associated with the lack of an effective public transport system, have significantly transformed the way of living in the urban centre.
At the demographic level, the aging of the population with the decrease in the number of births influences the city capacity for economic regeneration. It is certainly the result of this intricate causal process that, for the first time in its recent history, the county of Amarante saw its resident population decrease in the decade 2001-2011, passing from a total of 59,638 inhabitants in 2001 to 56,264 individuals in 2011 (a decrease of 5.7%).
Also, from a demographic and social point of view, there are very significant changes: in 2001, the young population, less than 20 years of age (26.0% of the total population), was higher than the elderly population (22, 6% of the total). Ten years later, this ratio was reversed, to 20.0% in the first case, and to 28.4% in the second.
In contrast to the regressive dynamics that have occurred, the tourism sector is growing thanks to the revalorisation of the historic and natural landscapes, and a better offer of events that animate the urban centre with their festive, cultural and social traditions.
Amarante is located near a large urban centre - Porto, which gives it a constant challenge to maintain the city’s attractiveness and to offer attractive jobs. However, Amarante considers this reality and takes advantage of it to attract investment, adding a set of reasons that guarantee advantages in this area. For example, the fact that Amarante is located in the center of an R & D triangle in several areas: proximity to higher education institutions such as the University of Porto, University of Minho, UTAD or Politecnico do Porto (which are only 40 minutes away by car), the privileged location 40 minutes from the International Airport and from Leixões Port and great road connections. These factors add to the fact that Amarante is part of the youngest region of the country, with excellent opportunities to find good human resources, as well as being a vibrant city rich in culture, sport, nature and tradition, which allows enjoy a good quality of life.






1.4 URBACT LOCAL GROUP
The Urbact methodology promotes the creation of a URBACT Local Group, adding a set of entities to strategically think the city centre, resulting in an articulated intervention.
For the construction of the Urbact Local Group, a survey was made to identify the entities that had intervention in the city centre, with the perspective of gathering a good represen­tation of the various themes related to urban revitalization such as: culture, environment, economy, youth, social action, urbanism and sport.
The interaction with the partners was always done through a representative chosen by the entity itself, making the communication more fluid and certifying the presence in the meetings of the ULG.

2 | INTEGRATED ACTION PLAN CONSTRUCTION



“Cities have the capability to provide something for everybody, only because, and only when, they are created by everybody.”
Jane Jacobs


The structuring of the action plan was based on the analysis made to the city centre and, subsequently, the definition of three major priority areas to be addressed in the plan and from there, to debate the ideas for the revitalization of the centre and definition of the pilot projects to be tested.

2.1 CITY CENTRE ANALYSIS

2. Questionnaire “Place Survey”

The questionnaire was developed by an expert URBACT and applied in all partner cities of the City Centre Doctor. This questionnaire was adapted to Portuguese and made available online, aiming to obtain the view of residents and users of the city centre of Amarante. The members of the ULG participated in the review, adaptation and distribution of the research questionnaires. The survey was conducted in October 2016.
This tool was composed of 19 questions and with the following data sheet:
. There were 308 responses. 55.27% of the respondents were women and 44.73% were men;
. Most of the answers obtained with the questionnaire were in the age range of 26-44 years, with a total of 60.7% (187 responses), followed by the 18-25 age group with 17.9% (55 responses), 46-64 years with 9.1% (28 responses), <18 years with 1% (3 replies) and finally +65 years with 0.6% (2 replies). 10.7% of the respondents did not answer the question that identifies their age group;
. Most of the people surveyed were born in the city of Amarante - 158 people;
. Close to 50% holds a bachelor’s degree and 21.1% the master or doctorate degree. Primary education is the one that shows the lowest expression with 1.4%, followed by secondary education, with 22.5% and, finally, level 5 present 5.4%.
This survey enabled the following indicators to be collected:
. The majority of respondents, 65%, go to the city centre by car, followed by more than 27% that go to the city centre on foot. Bus and bicycle are the transportation facilities with less expression, 4.3% and 3.1% respectively;
. People feel safe in the city centre - at night and on foot (4.2 and 4.4 points, respectively, on a scale from 1 (little) to 5 (too)). The cyclists feel less safe (average of 3.8 points);
. The city centre is rated as GOOD for leisure during the summer, contrary the winter that is less attractive, as can be seen from the tables below:
. The centre is good and conducive to business, as there are various businesses, from the commercialization of clothes and shoes, to cafes, restaurants and supermarkets:
. When evaluated on the preferential space for shopping, leisure, work, business, employment opportunities and creating the company, it is verified that the centre of Amarante faces some challenges: employment opportunities, entrepreneurship, business and shopping centres.

For the Generation of ideas were used several methodologies, namely, some already referenced in the analysis / study of space, which together resulting from the analysis to the city centre resulted in innumerable ideas for intervention in space.


2.3 PRIORITY AREAS OF INTERVENTION

After the detailed analysis of the diagnosis made and the difficulty of acting on all the identified themes, it was considered prudent to find three areas with a significant scope to structure an action plan based on these three focus. It was tried to understand how the areas to be intervened would contribute to attenuate the identified problems:

1. Attractiveness of the Public Space for community development
 
Built Heritage Preservation
 Furniture and Urban Signs
 Public Space
 Housing
 Mobility
 Inclusion
 
2. Economic dynamization and modernization
 
Education and Employment
 Development of the local economy 
 Attractiveness of the city
 
3. Local Identity
 
Natural Heritage
 Tourism
 


2.4 BETA ACTIONS

The Urbact methodology presupposes the creation of beta actions / pilot actions to test and evaluate certain actions in the context of the promotion and revitalization of the city centre. These pilot actions were developed prior to the construction of the Action Plan to test whether the results achieved would contribute to alleviating the problems identified.
In order to structure the pilot projects to be tested, we attempted to identify the challenges of the city centre, to address the most pressing areas of intervention and to contribute to urban revitalization.
The following Beta Actions were developed and implemented in the centre of Amarante:
1. MIMO a minha cidade (Mimo my city)
2. Free Walking Tour
3. Lojas de Rua com História (Street shops with a History)
4. Mercado de Natal (Christmas Market)








Beta Action | MIMO a minha cidade (MIMO my city)
 

Area of intervention:
 Attractiveness of the Public Space for community development
 
Activity Description:
The action “Mimo a minha cidade” had as main goal to promote the street trade of Amarante, taking advantage of the week when the city was prepared to receive the MIMO Festival, a time of peak tourist influx. The action was developed in the shop windows of the main streets of the Urban Rehabilitation Area of Amarante(ARU), personalizing them with the incorporation of a story that combines illustration with a narrative.
For the creative work (narratives and illustrations), was invited the writer Adelia Carvalho, and the illustrators Anabela Dias and Diogo Cardoso. The narrative constructed consisted in the reencounter between key figures of the historical universe of Amarante, namely Amadeo de Souza-Cardoso, Teixeira de Pascoes, S. Gonçalo, and the Trovador (creator of the Amarantina guitar), in which all of them express a very typical missing (in Portuguese Saudade) of the Portuguese culture , in which the main nostalgia is the Amarante landscape, and various elements of the city and its culture.
 
Results achieved:
. Interventions in Cândido dos Reis Street, 5 de Outubro Street and 31 de Janeiro Street
. A total of 78 shops involved.
. Raising the awareness of traders to the importance of shop window design, in increasing the attractiveness of trade. After the beta action some traders looked for experts (artists) for designing their shop windows.
 
Beta Action | Free Walking Tour
 

Area of intervention:
 Local Identity | Tourism
 
Activity Description:
As part of the celebration of World Tourism Day, on 27 September, the Amarante City Council held two sessions of “Free Walking Tours” in the centre of Amarante.
The activity took place in two periods of the day: the first at 10:00 a.m., with a session in Portuguese and the second at 3:00 p.m., with session in English.
The initiative intended to make known the centre of Amarante through its history and stories, free of charge.
 
Results achieved:
. 5 Participants in the period of 10:00 a.m. | 4 Participants in the 3:00 p.m.
. Visit Rating – 4.8 points (1 - bad to 5 - excellent)
. Duration of visit – 4.3 points (1 - poor to 5 - excellent)
. Route chosen – 4,8 points (1 - bad to 5 - excellent)
. Relevance of activity – 4.9 points (1 - poor to 5 - excellent)
 





Beta Action | Street Shops with History 
 

Area of intervention:
 Economic dynamization and modernization
 
Activity Description:
“The commerce of a city can, and must, be one of the distinctive and differentiating elements between cities.” In the scope of Urban Revitalization, the dynamism of local commerce becomes decisive. Besides their importance in the creation of urban dynamics, these trades, when historical, preserve unique and differentiating characteristics, whose history is confused with that of the city itself. For this reason, it is extremely important to map and monitor these trades, transforming them into a testimony of the city’s experiences and an integral part of its material and immaterial heritage.
The «Lojas de Rua com História» (Street Shops with History) initiative is promoted by the RUA and inspired by the program Shops with a History of Lisbon City Hall, recognized by URBACT as a good practice.
Selected Shops:
Ferreira da Cunha | Adega Kilowatt | Confeitaria da Ponte | Café Bar - Restaurante S. Gonçalo | Restaurante Zé da Calçada | Doçaria Mário | Novélia
 
Results achieved:
. 7 selected shops
. 6 selected shops consider that this action has increased the interest in their shop.
. 6 selected shops are totally identified with the concept “Street Shops with History”
. All traders consider the development of a municipal program “Street Shops with History” relevant.
. Traders believe that this initiative has more impact on increasing sales to tourists than locals.
 






Beta Action | Christmas Market
 

Area of intervention:
 Local Identity
 
Activity Description:
The first Amarante Christmas Market was developed, inspired by the markets already carried out in countries such as Germany, Estonia and the United Kingdom. It was intended to develop a small pilot version that tested the concept.
The implementation area chosen for the Market was Alameda Teixeira de Pascoaes. This site was chosen not only for its municipal importance, area of support to the facilities of the City Hall and the Amadeo Souza Cardoso Municipal Museum, but also for its centrality and proximity to the main commercial areas and the Amarante Municipal Market. It was proposed the installation of nine wooden houses, with gable roof, to accommodate the exhibitors, and a covered stage where the concerts and animations of activation of the Market will take place.
Exhibitors:
Filhos de Moura (pork sandwiches) | Apimarão – Associação de Apicultores da Serra do Marão (honey and derivatives) | RI_TE Wine Bar (wine, craft beer, juices and coffee) | APR Cogumelos – Associação Portuguesa de Cogumelos (fresh mushrooms, mushroom patties, mushroom sautéed) | Projeto AMARTE (identity craft) | Maria Amarantina (sweets) | POP-UP Artesanato (traditional handicrafts represented by different artisans on different days) | Officina Noctua (Urban Art) | Diwia (fashion) | FOL POP-CORN (popcorn)
 
Results achieved:
. 9 Stands for 16 Exhibitors
. 9 Concerts
. Overall assessment of the event – 3,8 points (1 - bad to 5 - good)
. Relevance to the promotion of products– 4,0 point (1 - little to 5 - very)

AMARANTE |  INTEGRATED ACTION PLAN

FINAL REMARKS
This document presents the main results and conclusions reached through the various methodologies and tools implemented by the Local Action Group.
Different techniques and methods were used in order to reach various types of audience / users in the city centre, taking into account that only with this concern we would achieve a comprehensive and correct diagnosis. However, it is important to highlight not only the relevance of the URBACT program and the methodologies learned, but also the cooperation of the 9 European cities which together with Amarante were part of the City Centre Doctor project, that have contributed to the building of synergies and good broader view on the future of the Amarante urban centre.
Based on the data, information and statistics obtained in the phase of diagnosis and analysis of the city, it was possible to have bases and the inspiration necessary for the later phase of generation and construction of ideas, as well as for the definition and structuring of the beta actions developed in the city centre.
With this solid and structured knowledge, it was possible to identify the main strategic axes and, from there, to build a coherent Action Plan, duly agreed with the vision and work already developed by each of the entities involved in this process.
As a result of these two years of work of the Local Action Group, 9 projects resulted, with incidence in priority areas for the development and growth of the city. It is expected that the next 4 years - the horizon time of the Integrated Action Plan - will be of great success and transformation for the Amarante city centre!

Executive Summary 


Heerlen 
20.02.2018 | V2  
1. Heerlen 
Heerlen is a relatively young city. In the last century, Heerlen experienced a growth spurt from a village with an agricultural economy to a prosperous city with an industrial economy. After the closing of the main employer, the mines, the city experienced a downward spiral economically, with all the socio-economic side effects that are related to this.  
 
From the turn of the century, a renewed confidence in the future is slowly but surely emerging. In addition to the manufacturing industry, the service economy is developing more and more. The mining history is no longer a traumatic experience, but gains its own appreciation in the collective memory of the city; among others in the form of a fully-fledged mining museum. Although the mining museum is not located in the center of the city, it can reinforce the tourist appeal of the city center of Heerlen. Due to large investments in the cultural infrastructure, the cultural sector is developing rapidly. This creates an ideal breeding ground for a blossoming creative sector. The demographic shift (the ageing population) challenges the municipality even more to stimulate young people in their development. The slogan ‘Krimp als Kans’ (roughly translated to ‘decline as an opportunity) was not a content-free marketing slogan, but reflects the conviction that there is room for innovation. This must of course be used fully. Together with Maastricht, Sittard-Geleen and the neighbouring city of Aachen, we all provide a distinctive offer so that the cities reinforce each other. 
 
The city centre of Heerlen is the urban signboard for the Parkstad Limburg region. It’s the place where Urban experience is tangible and where the IBA and Palet principles are applied. In certain areas, the balance may more often go to 'liveliness' instead of ‘liveability', also outside office hours. Public spaces beautifully decorated with murals, that are multifunctional and can also be used for events or for urban sports. Office space aimed at starters, retail/shop offers designed for the modern city dweller, with an affordable offer in an innovative package. A wide range of properties with the necessary facilities, urban and inexpensive with here and there some extra space. Easily accessible, also by bicycle and public transport. A visible but also tangible the story of Heerlen, heritage you can touch and/or play with. 
 
The center of Heerlen has evolved in recent years from a center of 90,000 inhabitants to a conglomerate Parkstad Limburg with 252,000 inhabitants, which is almost a quarter of all inhabitants in Limburg. 
 
The development took place along three lines: 
1) the foundation; 
2) people in the city; 
3) economic security. 
 
 
 1.1 URBACT City Centre Doctor - Revitalisation 

In 2013, Heerlen participated in a project led by the specialised innovation agency Fresh Forward, with marketing guru Jempi Moens. Several parties participated in this process, including civil servants, representatives of the hotel and catering industry, entrepreneurs, residents, education, APG, real estate, cultural institutions, etc. At the time this process was labeled as very successful. Here the name HeerlenMijnStad was created. The cooperation between the various participants was intensified and ultimately resulted in the start of the formal organisation Heerlen Mijn Stad. One of the first successes at the time was the Social Sofas project. Subsequently, the Murals were brought to the attention of the public and more and more became part of the public spaces. Parties managed to reach each other faster and the municipality of Heerlen also became an easier-to-approach partner. 
 
To further expand this collaboration, in 2014, it was decided that it was necessary to commence with a Heerlen-centrum program. The biggest question at the time; How should we engage in this process. At first the choice was made to collect expertise in other municipalities of comparable size in the region. Later on, the idea arose, if possible, to make use of national and European expertise and examples. Furthermore, no additional financing was provided for projects in the center during this period. Therefore there was also a need to investigate the extra possibilities for for instance financial aid from other (European) cities. 
 
Heerlen also searched for methods to transfer knowledge of the innovative projects in the center. How is it possible, preferably together with other ""players"", to make the center more attractive? How do we increase the involvement of the residents and entrepreneurs? How can we collaborate  in a better way 
so that citizen’s and entrepreneurial initiative is stimulated. Also because at the time there wasn’t a structured meeting schedule with the stakeholders in the city center.  Participating in the CCD project could possibly kick start this more collaboration. 
 
After it was announced that Heerlen had been selected to participate in the CCD project, the second step was to get the ULG (Urbact Local Group) together. As a foundation, an appeal was made to active members of the city center organisation Heerlen Mijn Stad. Not only are the ULG member the core of the CCD project, the ULG Heerlen is also closely involved in the realization of the Urban bidbook. The alderman who is responsible for the developments in the city center periodically informs the ULG about the developments. More about the ULG Heerlen is explained in chapter 2.2. 


1.2 CCD Place Analysis 
In accordance with the URBACT method, the ULG executed a 'place analysis' in Heerlen. For this place analysis the ULG set out a  survey among Heerlen’s citizens, several 'place observations’ were mapped out, and the 'problem tree analysis’ was put into practice. The following conclusions were drawn from this.  

  
The City Centre Doctor survey concludes some remarkable results. The largest number of respondents either resides in Heerlen or one of the other Parkstad-municipalities. They often visit the city centre due to easy access. The demographical characteristics of the respondents; nearly 80% live in the suburbs of Heerlen, 54% of the respondents are aged between 45-64 years, and 30% is more than 65 years old. 
 
The accessibility of the centre is perceived as positive, as well as parking facilities for bicycles and motorbikes. The respondents are also positive with regard to public transport. However, half of the consumers who visit Heerlen still travel by car, aside from the fact that many are not satisfied with the parking fees. They indicate that a lot of frustration regarding parking can be eliminated by openly communicating about the destination of the parking proceeds, and more transparency provided by the municipality. 26.5% of the surveyed frequently use a bicycle as a mode of transportation. This is also reflected in the increase in use and appreciation of (free) guarded and unguarded bicycle parking 
facilities. Which could explain the relatively large number of visitors using a bicycle as method of transportation. The welcoming feeling visitors experience (more than 50%) is also highly appreciated. Furthermore, feelings of insecurity have decreased dramatically in recent years.   
 
In principle visitors come to the city centre with the goal to either go shopping and/or go to a café or restaurant. 40% of the respondents shops at least once a week, from which 60% is satisfied with the opening hours from shops and food, beverage and entertainment. 38% of respondents indicate that they prefer shopping in Heerlen compared to neighbouring cities, 27% prefers a city nearby.  
The largest group of visitors do not come to Heerlen to shop the entire day; they only spend about 1-2 hours in the city. This can have various causes for instance; shop diversity. Half of the surveyed feel that there is something missing in the shop offer. The consumer survey from 2013 also noted the fact that consumers only spend a short time in Heerlen centre.  
 
When asked what is lacking, a couple of things are mentioned. On the one hand, consumers are demanding crowd pleasers such as Primark, while on the other hand there is a demand for more authentic, smaller and exclusive shops. The latter is, for small businesses in this time of economic crisis and the rise of Internet shopping, a difficult task. 
 
There are also critical comments on the layout and design of the city centre. Due to the lack of a compact shopping centre meaning that the shopping areas are scattered, it isn’t always clear for consumers where to go.   
 
Vacant retail buildings and empty spaces are for many visitors and inhabitants an eyesore. One of the ambitions in the Bid Book is to make the shopping centre more compact. They want to achieve this by reducing the total number of square meters used for retail surface with 30.000m2. In order to develop methods to counter shop vacancy various initiatives are being developed, like Streetwise, who aim to create structural arrangements for new entrepreneurs. Another initiative is in cooperation with centre organisation Heerlen Mijn Stad and the municipality to visibly tackle shop vacancy by temporary filling empty storefronts with thematic visual concepts. 
 
1.3 Heerlen = Urban 

Heerlen has chosen for a clear positioning strategy and profile. Heerlen = Urban: unfinished, raw, it challenges you to experiment and to create a contemporary experience, is innovative, young and creative in spirit. This suits our residents, it suits our city and adds something to the urban qualities in Limburg and the Euregion. Heerlen has room for innovation, space to experiment. Not only physically but certainly also mentally and is committed to developing this urban positioning strategy further. New initiatives that meet these requirements are given an opportunity and are embraced. This is expressed in events such as; The Notorious IBE, Pro Freestyle and Night in the Woods, in the creative clusters that have developed in various places in the city, in the murals that are receiving more and more national attention, and also physically in the development of de Vijf Pleintjes (referring to Heerlen’s five squares). Below you will find the brand values that fit this urban profile: 

Own choices 
 Innovation 
 ‘From the street’ 
 
Progressive 
 Looking across borders 
 Accessible 
 
Bold (having guts) 
 Stimulating & dynamic 
 Authentic 
 

 
By maintaining strong levels of commitment to the urban profile, we focus on the existing strength and identity of the region. Strongly complementary to, and therefore also attractive to, the inhabitants of cities such as Sittard-Geleen and Maastricht. Aside from that, the interaction with the German city Aachen can not be underestimated; With its thousands of students and a vast knowledge economy, there can be beautiful cross-fertilization between Aachen and Urban Heerlen. This is the only way that Heerlen-Centrum can make an important contribution to the location conditions needed to attract top talent to the region and the various campus sectors in the Euregion. With strong facilities such as the Smart Services industry, medical technology, tourism and creative industries making up about 20% of Limburg's employment, Heerlen and Parkstad are significant players in Limburg and the Euregion. 
 
Urban focus areas 
We distinguish four different urban focus areas, Urban Experience, Urban Heritage, Urban Culture and Urban Living. They give shape to the positioning strategy, Heerlen = Urban and serve as an organising principle for our efforts. These spheres are to a certain extent geographically clustered. Central is the urban center 'Urban Experience', on the southwest side with its historical significance we find 'Urban Heritage', on the east side the meeting place of youth and culture 'Urban Culture' and along the northwest side the urban green, residential, work and recreation area 'Urban Living'. These are the concentration areas of elements that are felt throughout the city.

1.4 Bidbook and its 25 ambitions  
In this chapter we look at the center of Heerlen from the different policy fields. Opportunities but also challenges are present in every policy field. The thematic approach gives the possibility to rise above areas and projects in the center. It should be clear that every area and project contributes to the ambitions per policy field. It is not an everyday strategy, but one in which commitment has been expressed by various partners such as IBA and Province of Limburg. Below the ambitions for the coming years. 

 
The ambitions are clustered in five topics; 1. Retail, hospitality, offices and housing, 2. Public space, 3. Culture, heritage, sport and education, 4. Events, leisure, experience and city marketing, 5. Sustainability, asbestos removal and transport. 
 
Ambitions 
1. We have the ambition to remove 40% of the retail square meters, of which we aim to realise at least half in 2020 (around 20,000 m2). 
2. We reduce vacancy in the core shopping area (around 8%). 
3. There will be at least 20 new store formulas in the center, of which 10 are new starters that reinforce the urban profile. 
4. Planological barriers to the hotel and catering industry will be removed if this leads to the reduction of retail square meters or a better connection / integration between retail and catering. 
5. We have the ambition to remove 40% of the office square meters in the center, of which we aim to realise at least half in 2020 (around 20,000 m2). 
6. We are transforming a minimum of 5000m2 of vacant real estate into breeding grounds for creative industries. 
7. We aim to add approximately 400 homes in the center of which 100-150 young people / student residences and 50-100 land-based / city housing, without reducing the number of current housing. 
8. Outside the core shopping area, living on the ground floor is permitted and encouraged. 
9. We will create an unambiguous profile for Heerlen's public space, which will reflect the profile of the different parts of the center on the street. In case of interventions in the public space, this profile will always be used with the addition of urban green. 
10. We will redesign the following squares according to the principles mentioned above: the Van Grunsvenplein, the Bongerd, the Raadhuisplein and the Zuidplein of the Maankwartier. 
11. We will restore at least twelve facades back to their former state.

22. The development of the center is accompanied by an extensive city marketing campaign. 
23. We will place 5000 solar panels in the center, with each project. 
24. For each project we will make the physical objects completely asbestos-free and re-use usable material that is released for recycling during demolition or renovation. 
25. We aim to realise a guarded and covered bicycle parking facility on the north side of the center and strive for good bus connections to the leisure ring, the smart services campus and the educational boulevard. 
26. We aim to invest in a citylab. 
 
2. The process of action planning 
The process of the changes in the city of Heerlen can be divided into two parts. Major changes are taking place in the public space under the command of the Municipality, and small-scale experiments (beta-actions) take place, especially in the squares, lead by the ULG. These beta actions ensure that smart connections are made, activities are tried out and through the analysis of these actions, when positive, they can be converted into permanent facilities. In this chapter the process and progress is presented.

2.2 Approach Beta Actions by ULG Heerlen 
As stated in the introduction, Heerlen is actively participating in the CCD project because they are interested in sharing and learning from the experiences of the other cities with similar challenges, combining knowledge to create ‘best practices’.  
  
Sharing and acquiring knowledge from the other partner cities and their URBACT Local Groups provides many practical insights. Increasing ones knowledge on subjects like introducing and/or integrating citizens' initiatives/budget, adjusting the design of public space to create interaction, or gathering ideas to minimize shop vacancy within the city centre, will help to create a more participative city centre. Knowledge surrounding these subjects is often gathered by practical implementation and experimentation, after which the focus is on reflecting and improving.  
 
The URBACT Local Group Heerlen consists of a diverse group of people from different backgrounds and ages. The majority are active volunteers from city centre organisation Heerlen Mijn Stad. This group is 
complemented with people of different genders, ages and their own expertise whom were invited personally. The purposes of the ULG Heerlen is to analyse local challenges and opportunities, to be part of the transnational network, and to contribute to this by communicating on a local level, and participating in meetings and visits. 
 
After mobilizing the ULG Heerlen in the spring of 2016, the municipality of Heerlen feels they have made a step in the right direction. One of the principles for the ULG Heerlen from the beginning was that the ULG does not have to execute the projects that are initiated by the Municipality of Heerlen. In fact, it is desirable that the ULG expresses its own wishes and also chooses its own direction. The ULG is, as described earlier, a representative reflection of the various parties in our city center. They have a share in the center, and work, undertake, organize or represent the interests of the various parties. Meaning that the ULG members know better than anyone what the best chances of succes are for ideas in the center. This is because they are active in the center every day. The ULG Heerlen aims to meet approximately six times a year. After the inspiring transnational working visits, the delegation presents feedback in the ULG meetings in the form of a presentation with photos and ideas.  




3. Setting of focus and objectives 
From the ‘place analysis’ survey conducted in the autumn of 2016, various points of attention emerged that are considered leading for the ULG. In this survey (in which 719 respondents participated) the residents of Heerlen were asked about their opinion about the center of Heerlen. This included the atmosphere, event calendar, work and store offer, visit frequency, parking offer, leisure offer. 
 
The results were not surprising in many areas. The participants were also asked an open question: ""What would the first thing be you’d like to change in the center of Heerlen?"" 
The answers to these questions are then divided into four categories: 
1. Shop/building vacancy  
2. Atmosphere, experience, design and public space 
3. Traffic and parking (car and bicycle) 
4. Shop offer - diversity of shop offer 
 
With the answers to this open question in the back of our mind, we then had to decide for ourselves in which area the ULG would have the most influence; as we all agreed it was important to have some quick ‘wins’. It will not surprise you that the choice quickly fell on the second category: Atmosphere, experience, design and public space. Some of the remarks spoke volumes: more terraces and street musicians; nicer pavement; more benches and meeting places; more water elements and the construction of small parks. 
 
The other themes were also seen as important, but the limited possibility of influencing a solution was experienced as objectionable. In addition, several organizations are already active in the other categories. Think of Streetwise (Shop/building vacancy) and Qpark (traffic & parking). In addition, the financial section of the other categories is also much larger, which makes realisation more difficult. 
 
In close consultation and in cooperation with other parties involved in the center (municipality of Heerlen, Heerlen Mijn Stad, cultural institutions, residents, catering and hospitality), a start was made with an initial  assessment. Where can we start? Which locations are in need of immediate changes? 
 
Meanwhile, several initiatives have already started and implemented. Here are some examples:  
1. A meeting with all the local event organisations  


In 2017, Heerlen was selected as the winner of ‘the event city of the year price’ (up to 100,000 inhabitants). Together with the event organizers a brainstorm session was organised with the main question ‘how can we positively influence the atmosphere and experience in the city center’. How can we help each other? Can events be linked? Does cooperation also provide financial benefits for the event organizers? 
One of the success stories is the collaboration between event organisers Limburgs Mooiste with Wheels & Bites in May 2017. This collaboration resulted in a mixed target group, a joint advertising campaign, and especially many visitors in our center. The enthusiasm among visitors and the organisers was large. 
In one of the other partner cities in the CCD project, Nort-sur-Erdre, we came into contact with an effective long-term planning system. Currently, we are now also working on a (multi-year) calendar, with one of the main priorities being that we can inform the community, stakeholders and entrepreneurs more timely about the impact of events. In Valmez we saw that the largest employer played an important role at the most important event (light show) in the city center. We are currently investigating how these types of partnerships can benefit Heerlen. How,  can we for example, involve DSM or other large stakeholders in the developments and events in the center? 
 
2. More green 
Together with the local residents and entrepreneurs involved, a first assessment was initiated on the possible locations of a ‘more green design’. A list was compiled with several possibilities. The first location was the square on the Geleenstraat. Together with the entrepreneurs and residents, the decision was made to speed up the existing plans for this location. This has resulted in the current square that was completed in the summer of 2016 and now generates many enthusiastic reactions. We have learned from other cities in the project (e.g. Amarante and Medina del Campo) that adding green (flowers, plants etc) not only makes a square lively, but also offers shelter from the various weather influences. This was taken into account in the Geleenstraat project. 

 
3. Accessibility city center 
The discussion in Heerlen about parking fees has been going on for some time, just like in other cities. Various stakeholders including real estate parties, Qpark, Heerlen Mijn Stad and the Municipality of Heerlen have been discussing for some time to see what the options are. The visits to other European cities (including Naas, San Donà di Piave, Nort-sur-Erdre, Amarante) showed that parking and traffic in the center plays an important role for a successful center. The big question is of course how to deal with these matters of accessibility; parking fees, parking locations etc. Each participating city has its own views on this, but also its own problems. 
 
4. Shop/building vacancy - shop diversity  
Since 2012 the organisation Streetwise has been active in Heerlen. And since 2015-2016 Streetwise is active in the municipalities of the Parkstad City Region and therefore able to act upon their Retail Vision. This means that developments in the retail and ‘best practices” are shared at regional level. Streetwise tries to link new entrepreneurs to owners of vacant properties; if possible, to achieve more accessible rent prices in order to generate a win-win situation for all parties for the owner-owner and the center. The counseling by Streetwise to the new entrepreneurs consists of all kinds of facets; setting-up a business plan, financial plan, choosing a business location, rental conditions and application for authorization.  Next to these practical matters is trust and cooperation of all stakeholders in the shopping area of great importance. For municipalities this means more flexibility when it comes to 
regulations on “blurring” concepts and new ways of financing new business like “crowdfunding”. Real estate parties are prepared to do concessions as soon as they meet a well prepared rental candidate and are even willing to invest in the necessary facilities of the property. We are proud to announce that in 2017 21 new entrepreneurs have settled in the center.  
The participating cities in the CCD project are all dealing with vacancy. However, there are several cities (e.g. Medina del Campo) where people are very committed to hosting creative entrepreneurship. It’s an interesting concept to host creative entrepreneurs in vacant buildings. 
 
5. Park Urbana 
Park Urbana was created in 2016 as part of the cultural festival Cultura Nova. Together with IBA-Parkstad the Park Urbana was designed and executed. A green environment was created next to the fountain on het Burgemeester van Grunsvenplein. In 2017, a new location was chosen with all partners. A firm foundation was the basis: an environment that is defined by bricks and has strong cooperation partners. The 2017 edition of Park Urbana, Hotel Park Urbana was located on de Vijf Pleintjes. We drew inspiration from the southern European cities in the project (Amarante, Medina del Campo, North- sur-Erdre and San Donà di Piave). In the first edition of Park Urbana using the nearby fountain as a was a perfect addition to the experience. In cities such as Medina del Campo, Amarante, Radlin, Naas, North-sur-Erdre, and San Donà di Piave, it became visible that access to water offers the city many possibilities. Heerlen unfortunately does not have this extra possibility. 
 
Learning 
Thanks to the choices made and the participation in the City Center Doctor project, Heerlen has already been approached several times to give presentations at various conferences. Heerlen has held a presentation at the Cities Forum and the Placemaking week. This is of course a great honor, and a special confirmation of the invested time and effort of all parties involved. Thanks to the approach regarding street art (murals), Heerlen even won a prize for good practice from URBACT. 


 
4. (BETA) actions and planning  
The beta actions developed and implemented by the ULG van Heerlen during the City Center Doctor project are first explained after which the planning is presented in the table below. In the table, under 'Resources / Assets’, we take account of investments. These investments are categorised as follows: € under €1.000, €€ under €10.000, €€€ under €100.000, and €€€€ above €100.000. 
 
1. Transformation Raadhuisplein on the Geleenstraat 



The project was initiated in order to liven up the square on the Geleenstraat, this was done by implementing green and fitting design elements. The result led to a welcoming square where people can meet, have lunch and more. 
 
2. Assignment Bernardinuscollege | Heerlen 2.0 
Highschool students visited the city center, from this location visit they brainstormed and wrote down their creative ideas to liven up the less attractive locations in the city centre. 
 
3. Hotel Park Urbana 
‘Hotel Park Urbana’ was the follow-up to the first edition of Park Urbana in 2016. Visitors were so enthusiastic about this temporary pop-up park that the decision was made to repeat the concept in 2017 in a different setting, the city centre. Together with various members of our ULG we opted for a place where the implementation of greenery was the most desirable: De Vijf Pleintjes. Together with all those involved (local residents, entrepreneurs and stakeholders), a new pop-up park was designed and opened just before the summer. The reactions were again very enthusiastic! Each square had its own identity within the concept.  The foundation ‘de Vijf Pleintjes’ was initiated, together the people (local residents, entrepreneurs) created an ambition document for 2018, that was handed over to the alderman. Their ambition was made very clear; a wish to have more permanent green in the squares. The Alderman Center has promised that the Wilhelminaplein and the Morenhoek will be tackled in the summer of 2018. The design phase has now started. This strategy was greeted with enthusiasm from the ULG. 



 
4. Parking Pilot

5. Resources and delivery mechanism 
The overview below shows the various closely involved parties that have had a direct influence on the developments in Heerlen-Centrum. At the municipality of Heerlen, the officials and departments that were not directly involved in the City Center Doctor project are also important parties to inform. Heerlen Mijn stad, as the city center organisation with its diverse community members, and communicative resources is an important partner that will continue to focus on co-creation in the future. The list below is only a reflection of the parties, of course the large companies are also gradually included in the process, which is why they are not included in the overview below. In this overview, we also did not include all entrepreneurs from Heerlen-Centrum and the many organizers of events and activities individually.

6. Risk analysis 
In the following chapter we describe the risks that we can anticipate in advance when implementing and continuing the objectives after the City Center Doctor project. 
 
The political risk 
In the near future Municipal Council elections will be held in Heerlen (March, 2018). The result of the elections might change the political reality which means that a different movement might become responsible for the implementation of the current plans. Political change is a difficult one as it can not really approached with objectivity, you can only speculate. This risk can be tackled by assuring that there are several alternatives and or options to ultimately achieve the goals. 
 
The financial risk 
The ambitious plans also require sufficient financial resources for implementation. If for some reason these funds can not be released, or if they are limited, this is a risk for the feasibility of the goals in the plan. This risk can be classified as one with alternatives. 
 
The community risk 
If there is not enough momentum with the implementation of the plans, there is a chance that ULG members will drop out. Where there is a lot of energy in the creative process with idea formation, drawing up the basic plans and the implementation of the beta actions, there is a chance that this energy will be lost in case of insufficient speed and feedback. Informing the community periodically by the alderman center also ensures a certain bond between the board and the community. This risk can be classified as a scenario with alternatives, where clear communication lines with known feedback moments are a basic condition. 
 
The redistribution risk 
Due to the failure of the redistribution between the municipalities of Landgraaf and Heerlen, the question arises: How can this region be strengthened?. At the moment the decision lies with the Minister of National Affairs; as the redistribution has a direct effect on the socio-economic issues in the region. A possible, and desirable solution for these socio-economic issues involves the merging of two or more municipalities. Not only does this choice generate a lot of rumour, a lot of man-hours and management skills are needed in order to lead the process to a good result. The extra administrative pressure is a risk that can distract from the goals we are aiming for. Again, this risk can be classified as a scenario with alternatives. It is therefore very important to ensure that the center of Heerlen is prominently positioned. 
 
The risk of not redistributing in the long term 
In the event that the Minister of National Affairs does not act in the necessary plans to strengthen the Parkstad region or for some reason has to postpone these plans, there is a chance that fewer resources will be available to implement plans. This can be financial, man-hours and infrastructural resources. The ambitions to implement city marketing properly might also become more and more difficult. 
 
Staff and key figures 
The ambition and scope of the plans for the change of the center of Heerlen is big. As a result, there is a lot of pressure among all those involved to achieve the objectives. It’s difficult to rule out that the key people in this process choose to change jobs or are tasked to a different project. The risk involved with this component can be characterised as high and very impactful. In order to deal with this, it is important to have frequent conversations both in the personal sense and with the stakeholders, in terms of the content and processes that are needed to achieve the ambitions. Also important here is also to keep the existing CCD network strong. At the moment the network is kept up to date via a Whatsapp group and there is almost no threshold to ask or inform each other via e-mail or otherwise. It is a very valuable network with a lot of knowledge and expertise. An important and lasting investment both on a business and personal level. 
 
 
 
  
7. Monitoring and communication 
Various components are important in the process. Heerlen Mijn Stad works with a process scheme in which six components are paramount. The ULG has opted to focus on these six steps, which will also ensure continuity in the development process in the future. 

 
1. Creating the community 


We want to continue doing this by continuing to involve the community in projects where the input of the community is desirable. In addition, through the annual meeting that city center organisation Heerlen Mijn Stad center organises, we can also invite the various parties to stay connected. 
 
In 2017, the ULG went on an inspirational trip to Rotterdam. A member of the ULG Heerlen came with the request to visit Rotterdam led by an Urban Explorer Ruud Tompot. Rotterdam is a comparable city to Heerlen in terms of DNA. Here, too, urban is an important theme and people have opted for non-everyday solutions to create an inspiring city center. Think of the district Katendrecht; the Markthal, North Sea Jazz, Erasmus Bridge etc. Further information about Ruud Tompot and his experiences can be found at: 
http://www.resetyourbrand.nl/Whatwedo 
http://www.resetyourbrand.nl/people/ruud-tompot 
 
All the members of the ULG were invited to participate in the idea/inspiration trip to Rotterdam. In addition, other interested parties who are active in our center are also invited to participate. 

 
The aim is to organise another inspiration trip before the end of the CCD project (either nationally or  in Euregion). The idea is to repeat these inspiration trips annually. 
 
Also we continuously want to share our knowledge with the international community, therefore we take our time hosting them. In October 2017, the Irish delegation from Naas visited Eindhoven and Heerlen. 
During the two days the delegation was introduced to the different innovative ideas and apporaches within the creative industry in Holland. Meeting were arranged between the delegation and several parties, like Walas (specialist on the re-use of building parts during demolition), representatives from the city center organization Heerlen Mijn STad, en they’ve visited several creative concepts in Eindhoven (Strijp S).  
 
2. Informing and collecting needs 


Through organising meetings, where the Alderman also periodically joins, the ULG members are informed and can indicate what their needs and the needs of their environment are. 
 
3. Co-creation 


By continuing to stimulate beta actions initiated by the community, co-creation continues to exist. 
 
4. Facilitating meetings 


The aim of the co-creation process and the beta actions is to bring the users of the city together. It is therefore said that during an activity meetings are facilitated. 
5. Documenting atmosphere and experience 


It is important to monitor the progress of the City Center Doctor project by (visually) recording the meetings and beta actions; photos and video. These are shared on the collective WhatsApp group where the City Center Doctor team draws inspiration from, and also on social media so that the rest of the ULG and interested parties can follow the process. The annual compilation put together by Heerlen Mijn Stad is also part of capturing the atmosphere and experience in the city center. The social media that are used are; Facebook and Twitter. 
6. Evaluating 


Evaluating beta actions and developments in the center together with the group is a very important aspect of development. Generating this feedback is also a basic requisite to keep the ULG together.
