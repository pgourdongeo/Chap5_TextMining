The new idea of considering the town itself and thinking of a different way of development, based on the improving of life quality , moved him to spread his thoughts all over our country. Fastly his ideals were endorsed by Mayors of towns of Bra (Francesco Guida), Orvieto ( Stefano Cimicchi) and Positano ( Domenico Marrone) as well as they met later the president of slow food Carlo Petrini’s support. The main goal of Cittaslow, was and still is today, to enlarge the philosophy of Slow Food to local communities and to government of towns, applying the concepts of ecogastronomy at practice of everyday life.

Municipalities which join the association are motivated by curios people of a recovered time, where man is still protagonist of the slow and healthy succession of seasons, respectful of citizens’ health, the authenticity of products and good food, rich of fascinating craft traditions of valuable works of art, squares, theaters, shops, cafés, restaurants, places of the spirit and unspoiled landscapes, characterized by spontaneity of religious rites, respect of traditions through the joy of a slow and quiet living. Good living means having the opportunity of enjoying solutions and services that allow citizens to live their town in an easy and pleasant way.

Living slow means being slowly hasty ; “festina lente” latins used to say, seeking everyday the “modern times counterpart” in other words looking for the best of the knowledge of the past and enjoying it thanks to the best possibilities of the present and of the future.

All of this will result in technological opportunities, modern solutions in communication, transportation, incoming, production and selling.

At present living and managing a Slowcity is just a particular way of carrying on an ordinary life-style rather than today’s trends.

Of course this way is meant to be, less frantic, yelding and fast; but there is no doubt that it will be more human, environmentally correct and sensible for the present and future generations; the project will respect small realities in a more and more global connected world.

Slow for a better life.

We are looking for “towns where men are still curious of the old times, towns rich of theatres, squares, cafes, workshops, restaurants and spiritual places, towns with untouched landscapes and charming craftsman where people are still able to recognize the slow course of the Seasons and their genuine products respecting tastes, health and spontaneous customs...."" (from Cittaslow Manifesto).

For this reason Slow Food has always sought the quality of life and made those things the main source of its success and of its worldwide expansion; Slow Food, together with those cities which mirror themselves in its ideals, have built the Cittaslow international network.

In times of “fast”, of production and of pressing velocity, carrying on such a goal seems to be an utopia; many majors coming from different towns have joined together and as well as with Slow Food in order to create the Cittaslow’s huge common project.

The movement has expanded to 100 towns and 10 countries all over the world since 1999, connecting administrators, citizens and Slow Food partners. He common goal is to have mutual experiences focusing on gourmet food, incoming, services qualities and on the environment.

The Slow Cities movement promotes the use of technology oriented to improving the quality of the environment and of the urban fabric, and in addition the safe-guarding of the production of unique foods and wine the contribute to the character of the region.

In addition, Slow Cities seek to promote dialog and communication between local producers and consumers. With the overarching ideas of environmental conservation, the promotion of sustainable development, and the improvement of the urban life, Slow Cities provide incentives to food production using natural and environmentally-friendly techniques (one method for this promotion is through the Presidia).

The designation “Slow City” will become the mark of quality for smaller communities (only those with less than 50,000 residents may apply).

Through the Climate Alliance, some 1,800 member municipalities and districts covering 27 European countries as well as a variety of regional governments, NGOs and other organisations are actively working to combat climate change. In terms of members, Climate Alliance is the largest European city network dedicated to climate action. Our members, ranging from small rural towns to cities with populations in the millions, accept climate change as a global challenge that requires local solutions.

This fact is demonstrated in Climate Alliance’s long tradition of promoting climate action both in European municipalities and with the indigenous peoples of the Amazon River basin, where local peoples have been practicing sustainable forestry for millennia. Equipped with an intimate knowledge of their environment and a direct connection to realities on the ground, they are, much like local governments the world over, best positioned to put climate action into practice within their territories. For European municipalities, such action typically comes in the form of initiatives for renewable energies, energy efficiency or energy conservation. For indigenous communities, climate action typically revolves around safeguarding their forests and territorial rights. We at Climate Alliance thus pair an emphasis on ambitious municipal action in Europe with support for stewardship of the rainforests by the indigenous peoples who call it home. Tangible targets.

Talk is good, real action is better. In addition to a commitment to climate justice via a partnership with indigenous peoples, each town, city and district joining Climate Alliance must pass a municipal resolution committing itself to cutting CO2 emissions by 10% every 5 years. This equates to a halving of per capita emissions by 2030 from 1990 levels – far more ambitious than any of the goals set on national and European levels thus far. Additionally, every member city and town supports indigenous peoples via a pledge to abstain from the use of tropical woods from unsustainably managed sources and to focus on FSC certified timber in their public procurement. These goals make Climate Alliance the only network of its kind with tangible targets – our members are leading the fight against climate change from the bottom up.
";"Fair, nature-based, local, resource-saving and diverse.

Measures taken to combat or adapt to climate change need to take the big picture into account. The hurdles we face are not only environmental, but increasingly also of a social and economic nature. We cannot, for example, rely on high-tech fixes such as carbon capture and storage that only bypass the root of the problem, encouraging society to go about its resource intensive business as usual. Even putting safety concerns aside, we cannot look to nuclear energy as the answer when we have no sustainable solution for the waste it creates.
Climate Alliance commitments.

Climate Alliance members have committed themselves to the continuous reduction of their greenhouse gas emissions, pledging to cut emissions by 10 percent every 5 years, equivalent
to a halving of per capita emissions by 2030 from 1990 levels. Each member has also signed
up to the long term goal of levelling off at 2.5 tonnes CO2 per person and year. By comparison, the European Environment Agency estimates that the average European emitted about 9 tonnes of CO2 in 2012. Clearly there is much to be done.

Climate Alliance cities undertake a wide array of measures to close this emissions gap, mostly focusing on a mix of energy conservation, energy efficiency and the use of renewable energies. The power of the local level.

Local governments are luckily in a relatively influential position when it comes to the ability to provoke positive change. They can implement urban planning and transport policy that promote climate-friendly mobility. They can give incentives and shape building codes to encourage energy efficiency in the building sector, not to mention the potential they have to serve as role models with their own public buildings stock. They can shape their emissions through targeted, climate-conscious public procurement, water use and waste disposal strategies, and they also hold sway in terms of agriculture, forestry and tourism. Finally, municipalities can engage their residents to contribute to the fight against climate change in their everyday lives, be it in terms of consumption patterns, lifestyle choices or ways of doing business.

Of course, the local level cannot act in a vacuum – reaching ambitious targets will also require concerted efforts on the international, national and regional levels. By getting off to a head start locally, however, Climate Alliance members are leading by example.";"As member cities and municipalities which have entered into a partnership with indigenous rainforest people to protect climate : cut CO2 emissions by 10 percent every 5 years ; halve per capita emissions (baseline 1990) by 2030 ; attain a sustainable leve.

They can give incentives and shape building codes to encourage energy efficiency in the building sector, not to mention the potential they have to serve as role models with their own public buildings stock. They can shape their emissions through targeted, climate-conscious public procurement, water use and waste disposal strategies, and they also hold sway in terms of agriculture, forestry and tourism. Finally, municipalities can engage their residents to contribute to the fight against climate change in their everyday lives, be it in terms of consumption patterns, lifestyle choices or ways of doing business.

Of course, the local level cannot act in a vacuum – reaching ambitious targets will also require concerted efforts on the international, national and regional levels. By getting off to a head start locally, however, Climate Alliance members are leading by example."

In this regard, cooperation through ACA is key to counter and fight the negative impacts of the covid19 pandemic crisis and its economic effects.

Vision.

As the Atlantic Cities Association – ACA reaches its 20 years in 2020, we can be proud of the network achievements, like the approval of the Atlantic Maritime Strategy by the European Council and the recognition of our expertise by the European Institutions. Since our foundation on July 7, 2000, we managed to consolidate the association as the Atlantic Urban forum, we gathered influence across the Atlantic Arc and the European Union, we worked on more than 200 project proposals and we count nowadays with a reinforced General Secretariat.

Today we represent more than 350 local authorities and 7 million inhabitants of the European Atlantic coast, positioning ACA as a major stakeholder of the Atlantic Arc. This role is reaffirmed through our active participation as an expert at EU level on different bodies and organizations (European Space Agency, Urban Intergroup, Committee of the Regions, Structural funds, etc), and we can affirm that we share a successful model of cooperation, as in the words of Xosé Sánchez Bugallo, Mayor of Santiago de Compostela, founding member of the Atlantic Cities network (2020), “We learn from each other and together we all work to improve the life quality and the expectations of our citizens”.";"Mission.

As a common basket of resources, the Atlantic Cities Association is a fundamental platform for the EU strategy of its member cities:

– Exchanges and cooperation: ACA supports cooperation between its members and beyond through the exchange of good practices, peer to peer learning as well as the transfer of knowledge and innovations.

– Advocacy of Atlantic public interest: ACA enhances the political stance of its members as local governments providing technical, theoretical and political support and referring to its large network of European contacts, notably in the quest for the recognition of the Atlantic macro-region.

– Fundraising: the association ensures a continuous strategic follow-up materialized through monthly newsletters of funding opportunities. Moreover, thanks to its 20 years of unique experience in proposal writing and European project management, ACA offers its support and advice in European projects

– Promotion and visibility: Atlantic Cities help its members attract tourism, investment and talent by proposing initiatives that increase their visibility such as Stella Atlantis.

New EU framework.

 An enhanced cooperation in the form of a macro-region in response to the challenges of the Atlantic territory and the Brexit effects. Therefore, contributing to a balanced development of the European territory by promoting territorial cohesion.
  Giving a local and common response to the ambitious economic, social and environmental objectives set out in the EU Strategy 2019-2024 and the effects of the crisis.
   Acknowledging cities as drivers of growth to become full actors in the development and implementation of European policies in the framework of the new Urban Strategies (Leipzig Charter).

The Covenant of Mayors was launched in 2008 in Europe with the ambition to gather local governments voluntarily committed to achieving and exceeding the EU climate and energy targets.

Not only did the initiative introduce a first-of-its-kind bottom-up approach to energy and climate action, but its success quickly went beyond expectations.

The initiative now gathers 9,000+ local and regional authorities across 57 countries drawing on the strengths of a worldwide multi-stakeholder movement and the technical and methodological support offered by dedicated offices.

The Global Covenant of Mayors is capitalising on the experience gained over the past eight years in Europe and beyond, and is building upon the key success factors of the initiative: its bottom-up governance, its multi-level cooperation model and its context-driven framework for action. 
Signatories’ vision.

Signatories endorse a shared vision for 2050: accelerating the decarbonisation of their territories, strengthening their capacity to adapt to unavoidable climate change impacts, and allowing their citizens to access secure, sustainable and affordable energy.
Signatories’ commitments.

Signatory cities pledge action to support implementation of the EU 40% greenhouse gas-reduction target by 2030 and the adoption of a joint approach to tackling mitigation and adaptation to climate change.

In order to translate their political commitment into practical measures and projects, Covenant signatories commit to submitting, within two years following the date of the local council decision, a Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan (SECAP) outlining the key actions they plan to undertake. The plan will feature a Baseline Emission Inventory to track mitigation actions and a Climate Risks and Vulnerability Assessment. The adaptation strategy can either be part of the SECAP or developed and mainstreamed in a separate planning document. This bold political commitment marks the beginning of a long-term process with cities committed to reporting every two years on the implementation progress of their plans.

The work of ECAD rests firmly upon the spirit of the UN conventions on narcotic drugs which limit the use of narcotic drugs to solely medical and scientific purposes in ECAD’s member cities. ECAD aims to improve the health of the member cities inhabitants and seeks to promote evidence based and humane drug policies firmly rooted in empirical science. We believe societies can affect the scale of their drug problems by making concerted efforts towards prevention, treatment, recovery and control.

ECAD believes harm reduction is not in conflict with a drug free vision, or a drug free life for the individual. We are in favour of harm reduction to the extent that it does not normalize non-medical drug use. Drug use should primarily be addressed through health and social interventions as well as alternatives to incarceration. Drug addiction should be met with a variety of health and social measures, not punishment.

ECAD serves the interests of its member cities by offering knowledge and tools for them to constantly improve their actions and policies to prevent drug use, reduce harm and facilitate recovery. ";"Promote and develop through democratic means the fight against drugs, in order to contribute to a Europe free from drugs ; provide experience and knowledge about the work against drugs and drug abuse at local, national and international levels. Organizes : Mayors Conference. Collects  and disseminates information. Initiates local and regional projects. ECAD is a non-profit organization incorporated in Sweden, the purpose and aims of which is to develope through democratic means drugfree cities and societies, and to promote and develop our common efforts against illicit drugs. The purpose of ECAD is to provide experience and knowledge about the work for freedom from illicit drugs, and against drugs and drug abuse at local, national and international levels. ECAD will work for democracy and development in the towns and cities of Europe.The spread of drugs and drug abuse constitute a threat to democracy and development. The long-term aims of ECAD are to contribute to a Europe free from drugs.. Prevent use, reduce harm and facilitate recovery


ECADs vision is a society free from drugs. ECAD seeks to be a positive force for an ambitious drug policy. ECAD aims to reduce both drug availability and demand, as well as the societal and individual impacts of drug-related harm and addiction.

Fifteen years after its creation, it now brings together 31 such authorities, responsible for improving the mobility conditions of some 1000 million European city dwellers.

Their role is often not very well known by the public, metropolitan transport authorities are the key decision bodies for all the issues related to public transport, and thus mobility, for the following reasons :

    Large cities are not viable without public transport. The high density of inhabitants and jobs makes space a very scarce resource. As a consequence, public transport, which is the most efficient mode of transportation in terms of space consumption per traveller, is the best answer to mobility needs in densely populated areas. The major disruptions which occur in large cities when public transportation fails to deliver its services (accidents, strikes) are the best illustration of this strong dependence.      Large cities suffer heavily from congestion and nuisances caused by the excessive use of private car. Pollution, noise, accidents are particularly acute in large urban environments and affect the lives of thousands of people.

    Metropolitan areas often have very complex institutional frameworks, involving different levels of authorities in charge of urban planning and transportation policies (municipalities, metropolitan area, region and sometimes even national governments, especially in the case of capital cities). Therefore, co-ordination and coherence of policies is a very crucial aspect to ensure that citizens can have access to an integrated and high-quality network of public transport.

    Public transport networks are usually complex in large cities, requiring a strong integration. Metropolitan areas usually have several public transport modes in operation (bus, tramway, metro, regional rail services, sometimes water services). It is also frequent to have different companies operating parts of the public network of a metropolitan area. Integration of modes and of operators (physical integration of services, integration of fares and of information, etc.) is therefore a fundamental task of transport authorities so as to be able to offer travellers a seamless trip.

All these characteristics highlight the importance, as well as the complexity, of the missions of public transport authorities in large cities.

A European and international network of actors of a territorial economy of knowledge.

The RVN’s aim is to create synergies and joint efforts in terms of setting up technologies of information and knowledge, in order to favour, on a scale of the territories, the access to knowledge and to social, cultural, and professional interactivity.
It was created because of the will, on one part of a team of researchers and teachers to develop a truly European analysis in terms of utilisation of numerical technologies in furtherance of a better governance and of the development of local communities.
Since its creation, it intends to participate in the elaboration of a new architecture of powers in France and in Europe by trying to multiply the synergies between local actors, territorial institutions, economical organisms and cultural entities whose strategies intend to make info technologies major tools of land settlement. To confer a visibility conjugated to the present as well as to the future, to accompany experimentations and to give value to genuine report of experts constitute its major objectives. Today, no decision is conceivable for the future of our towns and regions without an intimate knowledge of the European views and without a prospective analysis associated to an enhancer of territorial identity in all its forms.

A  » digital city  » is first of all a territory of attractiveness and polarity, a territory of innovation. To participate in the elaboration of the components of the territorial intelligence constitutes the network’s first concern through the backing up of the communities in their projects involving the numerical technologies:

    Setting on-line of the cultural heritage, internet access points.
    Development of European and international interactions between the spatial polarities of competitiveness such as the image poles that the RVN strives to connect between themselves, set them into network, on a European scale.
    On-line services for the inhabitants.
    Creation and participation to networks of excellence sharing goals of the same kind – notably in the area of technologies of convergence (bio and nanotechnologies, digital and cognitive technologies).
    Elaboration of projects for the European Commission (with in the future an important contribution to the future European platform of academic laboratories and territorial entities for a better contribution of the externalities of the sustainable development).

Thanks to its efforts to bring together the carrier of local projects, the network has received several distinctions during the last few years. Among these, it became in June 2002 the label  » Paris Europe  » from the city of Paris, notably with a view to organize the European days ( » Journées européennes « ). For its program « Digital cities for everyone » and the events that the RVN contributed to organize, the networks has also received the label of the European Year for the handicapped people from the Secretary of State to the handicapped people in 2003. Additionally, it has received the Trophy @ Cybervilles ( » Trophée @ Cybervilles « ) in Nice in 2001.
Following the creation of a European Observatory (Observatoire européen) in that matter and following the development of a Club of Prospective Analysis (Club d’Analyses Prospectives), the association became a genuine circle of reflection for the territorial officials wishing to develop their informational devices, uniting the economical and institutional actors that intend to meet at best the goals set by the European Union at Lisbon by 2010 in terms of strategic management of attractiveness, intelligence and image of the territories of course the entrepreneurial creation and innovation.

Today, it is suitable for the RVN to replace the purely theoretical and partisan debates with concrete actions of digital inclusion through a common vision in terms of territorial prospective. To mutualize – between the firms that the communities take in – markets and analysis, tools and services, with always as prime decisiveness the creation of activities and jobs. It is for the association a true emergency.

Its Club of Prospective Analysis (Club d’Analyses Prospectives) has given itself, within this framework, the mission to find new modalities of mediation and encounter as well as possibilities of transmission of knowledge on the great storyline of the 2020-2030 horizon. The European Observatory of the Multimedia (Observatoire européen des Espaces Multimédia) intends to constitute, next to the RVN, a genuine tool of action concerning new spaces, to facilitate the actions of the local economical actors and of the people in charge of the professional insertion and of course the setting up of strategies of watch and expertness.

The network has thereby been lead up to structure itself in order to be able to answer an always increasing volume of information but also to support some of its members in the realisation of their project. Its partners and members, all professional actors in the economical development, are thus territorial organisms, universities, firms, associations and of course recognized researchers for their expertness whose excellency constitute the primary condition of the relevance of the association’s actions.

The setting up in 2005 of a new organisation permits it today to answer in a very precise manner to the territorial decis ion-makers by offering them a base of prospective studies on the tools use d in the development, governance and formation projects in order to be able to define their objectives benefiting of a perspective on the various implications of their decisions, of a cartography of the projects realized, mainly in Europe – but also on other continents – to underline the success and failure vehicles and avoid to reinvent process that have already been developed and of course a network of firms and experts able to bring their knowledge during the different stages of the realisation. Delegations and poles of thematic competences will be open to that end in a certain number of regions – some of them in France-, places where all the territorial actors will be able to meet but also participants to ac ademic seminars and study groups.
These places will of course have to support at the European scale the local initiatives of the communities in the realisation of their projects.
The management of a territory building in multiform projects managed by different actors interacting with each other. The RVN also hosts many task groups to increase the coherence of the lead actions: the very nature of its horizon of analysis and intervention lays a permanently evolving structure, favouring thanks to the sharing of ideas and competences the implementation of new programs.

Hence, its objectives are first:

    The strengthening of the European co-operation through a better knowledge of the infrastructures developed at the scale of all the communities.
    The improvement of the synergies between public and private entities, territorial instances and European and international institutions in the realisation of projects, the sensibilisation of all everyone to the horizons of local development generated by the new economical and social paradigms.
    A presentation of experiences of knowledge management useful to the proactive development of a territory.
    And of course support the innovating projects presented to the association and which constitute its everyday life.

The RVN thereby participates in a large number of national and international events permitting it to give value to the works of its members and partners and to establish many partnerships in the area of television and radio, of written press and of new informational media.
Its analysis are largely conveyed by the media, but it has also given itself the task to support these in order to place at their disposition the biggest possible number of information concerning what it advocates and its areas of competencies.
As a participant, organizer or co-organizer, the network has, up to today, participated in more than 500 manifestations. Through the debates and seminars organised all over Europe, it has notably wanted to hand over to all those that wanted to contribute to the modernisation of the public institutions. It appears all the more important in this respect since the acknowledgement of the new territories that have joined the European Community or that are going to do so- the RVN has just participated in November 2005 to the Franco Romanian encounter of decentralised co-operation ( la encontre franco-roumaine de coopération décentralisé) in Cluj – which a lot of the economical projects of the coming years (reflection on certain mechanisms of delocalisation of activities) will not be able to contemplate without an important co-operative work with the territories of Central and Eastern Europe.

The prime characteristic of the association today is its conviction that the setting up of a true territorial knowledge management constitute the essential condition to the creation of environments favourable to innovation. It is that creation of environments in France and in Europe that the network intends to concentrate on in the coming years, with notably the creation of regional learning environments permitting to confer a true visibility to all the actors of contemporary mutations.
hence, the RVN works closely with all the private and public organisms interested and concerned, on the whole set of issues linked to innovation on the local and regional scales: through the « cities and districts of knowledge » in Spain, Germany and Italy, the Anglo-Saxon « intelligent territories » but also the Canadian « ingenious cities », new forms of land settlement must nowadays be invented in a close synergy with the public institutions.
The « learning regions » (regions apprenantes) and the regional systems of innovation nevertheless suppose relatively complex territorial arrangements in their laying out and, here again, a visibility that the territorial actors do not always possess, far away from it, while relevant models exist: the links between agencies of regional development and the academic institutions have to be strengthened in this respect notably through European encounters of dissemination of projects and realisations. The association clearly wishes to concentrate on that task.";"";". . The European Network of Digital Cities (RVN).
A European and international network of actors of a territorial economy of knowledge.

The RVN’s aim is to create synergies and joint efforts in terms of setting up technologies of information and knowledge, in order to favour, on a scale of the territories, the access to knowledge and to social, cultural, and professional interactivity.
It was created because of the will, on one part of a team of researchers and teachers to develop a truly European analysis in terms of utilisation of numerical technologies in furtherance of a better governance and of the development of local communities.
Since its creation, it intends to participate in the elaboration of a new architecture of powers in France and in Europe by trying to multiply the synergies between local actors, territorial institutions, economical organisms and cultural entities whose strategies intend to make info technologies major tools of land settlement. To confer a visibility conjugated to the present as well as to the future, to accompany experimentations and to give value to genuine report of experts constitute its major objectives. Today, no decision is conceivable for the future of our towns and regions without an intimate knowledge of the European views and without a prospective analysis associated to an enhancer of territorial identity in all its forms.

A  » digital city  » is first of all a territory of attractiveness and polarity, a territory of innovation. To participate in the elaboration of the components of the territorial intelligence constitutes the network’s first concern through the backing up of the communities in their projects involving the numerical technologies:

    Setting on-line of the cultural heritage, internet access points.
    Development of European and international interactions between the spatial polarities of competitiveness such as the image poles that the RVN strives to connect between themselves, set them into network, on a European scale.
    On-line services for the inhabitants.
    Creation and participation to networks of excellence sharing goals of the same kind – notably in the area of technologies of convergence (bio and nanotechnologies, digital and cognitive technologies).
    Elaboration of projects for the European Commission (with in the future an important contribution to the future European platform of academic laboratories and territorial entities for a better contribution of the externalities of the sustainable development).

Thanks to its efforts to bring together the carrier of local projects, the network has received several distinctions during the last few years. Among these, it became in June 2002 the label  » Paris Europe  » from the city of Paris, notably with a view to organize the European days ( » Journées européennes « ). For its program « Digital cities for everyone » and the events that the RVN contributed to organize, the networks has also received the label of the European Year for the handicapped people from the Secretary of State to the handicapped people in 2003. Additionally, it has received the Trophy @ Cybervilles ( » Trophée @ Cybervilles « ) in Nice in 2001.
Following the creation of a European Observatory (Observatoire européen) in that matter and following the development of a Club of Prospective Analysis (Club d’Analyses Prospectives), the association became a genuine circle of reflection for the territorial officials wishing to develop their informational devices, uniting the economical and institutional actors that intend to meet at best the goals set by the European Union at Lisbon by 2010 in terms of strategic management of attractiveness, intelligence and image of the territories of course the entrepreneurial creation and innovation.

Today, it is suitable for the RVN to replace the purely theoretical and partisan debates with concrete actions of digital inclusion through a common vision in terms of territorial prospective. To mutualize – between the firms that the communities take in – markets and analysis, tools and services, with always as prime decisiveness the creation of activities and jobs. It is for the association a true emergency.

We look to implement practical solutions to marine environmental problems. And we seek funding to run demonstrative projects which allow our members to highlight these solutions to governments and policymakers.
We concieved Fishing for Litter projects, which our members directly manage in the UK and the Netherlands. Fishing for Litter has been hugely successful in encouraging fishermen to take ashore litter and abandoned, lost or discarded fishing gear (ALDFG) that they find during their normal fishing activities.
Our PitchIN project, developed together with Scottish NGO Fidra, has been instrumental in raising awareness about the contribution of artificial sports pitches to microplastic pollution – and in highlighting abatement measures and alternatives.
Creating opportunities to exchange knowledge and experience internationally.
Each year we host an Annual Conference, with guest speakers, workshops and discussions about crucial issues affecting the marine environment. These meetings are a unique opportunity to meet, exchange experience and network with politicians, local government officials and other key stakeholders. 

Each year one of our member municipalities hosts our Annual Conference. This offers an opportunity to showcase the best of a city or region on the international stage. The most recent meetings were held in Malmö/Lomma, Sweden (2017),  Aalborg, Denmark (2018) and Velsen, the Netherlands (2019). 

We also conduct research, produce reports and write best practice guidelines. We work in collaboration with academics, research institutions and other organisations to ensure that the information and evidence-base used to back up our lobbying is both accurate and contemporary. 

For example, see our work on microplastic pollution from artificial sports pitches, net cuttings pollution from the fishing industry and microplastic emissions from textiles.

The League also aims to contribute to the further development of each historical city. The City of Kyoto proposed the World Conference of Historical Cities in the hope of an exchange of precious experience and knowledge acquired by each of the Historical cities and exploring the roles which should be played by cities to encourage the well-being of human race and the enrichment of its culture as we head towards the 21st century.
In 1987, the first Conference was held in Kyoto.
In order to continue holding the conference and promote exchange between the participating cities, the World Conference of Historical Cities Council was established.
Then the second Conference was held in Florence in 1988, and the third conference was held in Barcelona and Girona in 1991.
On the occasion of the 4th World Conference of Historical Cities, held again in Kyoto in 1994, in order to further strengthen the foundation of the World Conference of Historical Cities it was decided to reorganize and develop the existing Council to form an expanded League of Historical Cities with new member cities.

In order to achieve the objectives set out in Article 3, the League shall.
Hold the World Conference of Historical Cities (hereinafter referred to as and as provided in Chapter XI as the ""Conference"").
 Publish a bulletin and other publications.

Our purpose in forming this League is to contribute to the realization of eternal world peace so desired for the future of mankind by all people everywhere; an organization which will deepen mutual understanding by transcending national boundaries and building on the common foundation of historical cities to strengthen affiliations between cities. Our aim is to make use of this coming together of cities for the World conference of Historical Cities in order to also establish a forum enabling further exchange between the participating cities; not only for the period during the conference, but on an ordinary, everyday basis as well; and not merely with respect to issues such as government, citizens' lifestyles, and so forth.
The League also aims to contribute to the further development of each historical city. The City of Kyoto proposed the World Conference of Historical Cities in the hope of an exchange of precious experience and knowledge acquired by each of the Historical cities and exploring the roles which should be played by cities to encourage the well-being of human race and the enrichment of its culture as we head towards the 21st century.
In 1987, the first Conference was held in Kyoto.
In order to continue holding the conference and promote exchange between the participating cities, the World Conference of Historical Cities Council was established.
Then the second Conference was held in Florence in 1988, and the third conference was held in Barcelona and Girona in 1991.
On the occasion of the 4th World Conference of Historical Cities, held again in Kyoto in 1994, in order to further strengthen the foundation of the World Conference of Historical Cities it was decided to reorganize and develop the existing Council to form an expanded League of Historical Cities with new member cities.
The League was established with the unanimous approval of all participants.. The aims and objectives of the League are, in conformity with the spirit manifested in the Preamble, to assist the Member Cities, which are tied together by the very fact of their being Historical Cities which take pride in and endeavor to foster their unique heritages, in constantly promoting their friendship beyond national frontiers, and to contribute to the promotion of cooperation in daily exchange.
In order to achieve the objectives set out in Article 3, the League shall.
Hold the World Conference of Historical Cities (hereinafter referred to as and as provided in Chapter XI as the ""Conference"").
 Publish a bulletin and other publications.
 Organize exchanges of information, joint research and technical cooperation. And organize other projects necessary for accomplishing the League's objectives.

The Conference of the Mayors has become formally recognized as an opportunity for yearly meetings of member capitals, where they could define their further cooperation and take common stands towards the most important topics in the Region.

The crucial legal document of the Conference is the Statute according to which there have been established:

- President of the Union (changing yearly following the principle that Mayor of hosting city has the role of the presiding of the meeting) and

    The requirements are: a commitment to health and a process and structure to achieve it.
    A healthy city is one that continually creates and improves its physical and social environments and expands the community resources that enable people to mutually support each other in performing all the functions of life and developing to their maximum potential.
    WHO/Europe recommends a basic model for a healthy city.

Healthy Cities approach

The approach seeks to put health high on the political and social agenda of cities and to build a strong movement for public health at the local level. It strongly emphasizes equity, participatory governance and solidarity, intersectoral collaboration and action to address the determinants of health.

Successful implementation of this approach requires innovative action addressing all aspects of health and living conditions, and extensive networking between cities across Europe and beyond. This entails:
Explicit political commitment;
 Leadership;
 Institutional change; and intersectoral partnerships.

The Healthy Cities approach recognizes the determinants of health and the need to work in collaboration across public, private, voluntary and community sector organizations. This way of working and thinking includes involving local people in decision-making, requires political commitment and organizational and community development, and recognizes the process to be as important as the outcomes.The concept of Healthy Cities was inspired and supported by the WHO European Health for All strategy and the Health21 targets. It is fully aligned with the European policy framework Health2020 and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. ealthy cities are places that deliver for people and the planet. They engage the whole of society, encouraging the participation of all communities in the pursuit of peace and prosperity. Healthy cities lead by example in order to achieve change for the better, tackling inequalities and promoting good governance and leadership for health and well-being. Innovation, knowledge sharing and health diplomacy are valued and nurtured in healthy cities.
People.

A healthy city takes a human approach to development, prioritizing investment in people and ensuring access for all to common  goods and services. This includes:

    investment in human and social capital as a strategic approach for urban development ;
    promoting inclusion, integration and non-discrimination ;
    building trust, resilience and a focus on ethics and values.

Participation.

A healthy city leads by example ensuring community participation in decisions that affect where and how people live, their  common goods and services. This includes:

    improved city spaces and services, based on the needs and assets in communities ;
    stronger accountability and governance for health and well-being ;
    empowered and resilient populations ;
    increased ownership over individual health and well-being.

Prosperity.

A healthy city strives for enhanced community prosperity and strengthened assets through values-based governance of common  goods and services. This includes:

    progressive measures of social progress ;
    investment in the circular economy ;
    universal minimum social protection.

Planet.

A healthy city ensures that the health and well-being of both the people and the planet are at the heart of all the city’s  internal and external policies. This includes:

    a whole-of-city approach to health and well-being ;
    coherence across levels of governance in the approach to health and well-being ;
    strengthened city health diplomacy.

Place.

A healthy city creates an accessible social, physical and cultural environment that facilitates the pursuit of health and  well-being. This includes:

    shifting from a needs-based to an assets-based approach
    human-centred urban development and planning
    integrating health equity and sustainability into urban development and planning
    enhanced inclusiveness in the use and governance of common spaces.

Peace.

A healthy city leads by example by promoting and keeping peace in all its actions, policies and systems. This includes:

    institutions, governance systems and architecture that prioritize social justice and inclusive participation;
    the promotion of cultural norms of inclusion and equity, a non-exploitative egalitarian approach;
    formal governance and societal norms that tackle corruption, discrimination and all forms of violence.
";"The network’s activities have been organized into phases of roughly 5 years, with differing priorities. For example, phase  III (1998–2002) focussed on the social determinants of health, whereas phase IV (2003–2008) had a special emphasis on healthy ageing. The member cities can vary from phase to phase.

When a city joins the network they commit to delivering materials, data and stories, all of which form a body of evidence  that they are making a difference in putting health high on social and political agendas. Healthy City coordinators, their teams and local political leadership report annually on the state of their city through annual reporting templates.";"Standard setting ; training ; fund raising ; informatin exchange.

    Innovation – Since 2009 Eixo Atlantico has been working in a Digital Local Agenda for the Euro region.
    Territorial and social cohesion – Under this pillar, Eixo Atlantico works on various issues like transport, enhancement of cultural heritage, culture or tourism, to boost endogenous potential of our cities.

Developing its cooperation activities, the Eixo Atlántico works mainly in the following fields:

    Modernisation of Administration, as a way to generate new services more effective to citizens.
    Sustainable Development, as an instrument to optimize urban planning. In this context, the Eixo Atlantico has created the first Euro regional Urban Ecology Agency, in Vila Real (Portugal).

    Tourism, to develop the internal touristic potential of the 37 local authorities of the Eixo Atlantico as a mean for further socioeconomic development.
    Sports, as axis to bring together cities and citizens.
    Social Development, working in new organisational models and good practices in social and training fields.
    Transport, to analyse the evolution and results of regional policies and make recommendations.

Work is done trough:

    Studies, plans, programmes and projects, financed from national, European or international funds.
    Bridging relations between agents, public or private structures and institutions working for development in border regions.

Finally, it is also important to highlight the work of Eixo Atlantico to disseminate the European process.

It brings together the cities of Berlin, Helsinki, Malmö, Oslo, Riga, Stockholm, St.Petersburg, Tallinn, Vilnius and Warsaw. The main goal of the network is to promote innovativeness and competitiveness in the Baltic Sea Region by engaging cities, as well as academic and business partners, into close cooperation. Another focus area is identity building and marketing of the Baltic Sea Region. Metropolises play a central role in Europe’s efforts to become the most competitive, knowledge-based economy in the world.
The Copenhagen resolution accepted during the BaltMet founding conference in 2002 highlighted that direct metropolis-to-metropolis contacts are vital for the Europe of the future. Baltic Metropolises aim at further co-ordination of viewpoints and initiatives between the metropolises and at communicating joint views to political decision-makers. Baltic Metropolises are also interested in providing substantial contribution into the Northern Dimension actions. In October 2006 in Helsinki BaltMet Mayors presented a priority list on the most important investment projects in environment and infrastructure in the Baltic Sea Region. In parallel, due to regular contacts among the participating cities, the network has promoted a great deal of learning and experience exchange in different areas and levels of city administrations.
The current directions of joint work are summarised in the BaltMet Action Plan 2011 – 2012, accepted at the Mayor’s meeting in Tallinn in February 2011. Previous work plan is outlined in the BaltMet Action Plan 2008 – 2010, accepted at the Mayors’ meeting in Tallinn on 6 November 2007.
The work of BaltMet is based on regular Mayors’ Meetings – the main decision making body, supported by the regular Officials’ Meetings. Mayors meet annually to decide on the new areas of cooperation among the partner cities. The Network is coordinated and administratively run by the Chair City in cooperation with two Vice Chair Cities, elected by the Mayors for two years.";"The BaltMet Network operates through initiating and co-ordinating particular co-operation projects between the member cities.
Through the project co-operation the network develops innovative approaches to involve actors especially in the fields of science, business and city administration.
 
Current projects and initiatives carried out under Baltic Metropoles umbrella:
 
Creative Metropoles – strengthening public policies and support instruments for developing the economic potential of creative industries.

 
Baltic Sea Innovation Network Centres (BaSIC) – identification, selection and  training of fast-growing, innovative SMEs.

";"Baltic Metropoles Network (BaltMet) represents a forum for capitals and large metropolitan cities around the Baltic Sea. It brings together the cities of Berlin, Helsinki, Malmö, Oslo, Riga, Stockholm, St.Petersburg, Tallinn, Vilnius and Warsaw. The main . . altic Metropoles Network (BaltMet) represents a forum for capitals and large metropolitan cities around the Baltic Sea. It brings together the cities of Berlin, Helsinki, Malmö, Oslo, Riga, Stockholm, St.Petersburg, Tallinn, Vilnius and Warsaw. The main goal of the network is to promote innovativeness and competitiveness in the Baltic Sea Region by engaging cities, as well as academic and business partners, into close cooperation. Another focus area is identity building and marketing of the Baltic Sea Region. Metropolises play a central role in Europe’s efforts to become the most competitive, knowledge-based economy in the world.
The Copenhagen resolution accepted during the BaltMet founding conference in 2002 highlighted that direct metropolis-to-metropolis contacts are vital for the Europe of the future. Baltic Metropolises aim at further co-ordination of viewpoints and initiatives between the metropolises and at communicating joint views to political decision-makers. Baltic Metropolises are also interested in providing substantial contribution into the Northern Dimension actions. In October 2006 in Helsinki BaltMet Mayors presented a priority list on the most important investment projects in environment and infrastructure in the Baltic Sea Region. In parallel, due to regular contacts among the participating cities, the network has promoted a great deal of learning and experience exchange in different areas and levels of city administrations.
The current directions of joint work are summarised in the BaltMet Action Plan 2011 – 2012, accepted at the Mayor’s meeting in Tallinn in February 2011. Previous work plan is outlined in the BaltMet Action Plan 2008 – 2010, accepted at the Mayors’ meeting in Tallinn on 6 November 2007.
The work of BaltMet is based on regular Mayors’ Meetings – the main decision making body, supported by the regular Officials’ Meetings. Mayors meet annually to decide on the new areas of cooperation among the partner cities. The Network is coordinated and administratively run by the Chair City in cooperation with two Vice Chair Cities, elected by the Mayors for two years.. The BaltMet Network operates through initiating and co-ordinating particular co-operation projects between the member cities.
Through the project co-operation the network develops innovative approaches to involve actors especially in the fields of science, business and city administration.
