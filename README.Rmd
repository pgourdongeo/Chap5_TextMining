## Content

This this repository is dedicated to text mining of reports, key-words, and legal documents produced by transnational municipal networks (Database ETMUN) and URBACT programme (EUCICOP).

Apart from the text corpora, all other data come from the EUCICOP and ETMUN databases, as constructed and discussed in  [chapter 3](https://github.com/pgourdongeo/Chap3_LocationalAnalysis) and  [chapter 4](https://github.com/pgourdongeo/Chap4_NetworkAnalysis) .
